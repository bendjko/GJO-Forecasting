The missile, which North Korean state media identified as the Hwasong-14, or the Mars-14, was launched at 9 a.m. local time Tuesday from an airfield in the country\u2019s northwest. Leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the test (para. 5). The missile, like others that Pyongyang has tested this year, was fired at a steep trajectory, reaching an altitude of about 1,740 miles before splashing down 580 miles away between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, according to North Korean state media. The numbers were in line with U.S., South Korean and Japanese military analyses, though the Pentagon initially identified the missile as an intermediate-range ballistic missile. \u201cAs a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful intercontinental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world, along with nuclear weapons, the DPRK will fundamentally put an end to the U.S. nuclear war threat and blackmail,\u201d North Korea\u2019s state media said in a statement, using the country\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (para. 5-7). \u201cThe question of when they will be ready is immaterial,\u201d Mr. Rubin said in an interview. \u201cThey are ready\u201d (para. 14). Some analysts cautioned that North Korea faces many technical hurdles before it has a fully operational nuclear-armed ICBM. Among the challenges is ensuring the missile can carry and detonate a warhead at a predetermined target. North Korea has said it can mount a nuclear bomb on a long-range missile, but opinion is divided on whether it has that ability. Markus Schiller, a rocket analyst with German space and defense consultancy ST Analytics, said North Korea faces several years of engineering work. \u201cTheir work is just starting,\u201d he said. Mr. Rubin is less sanguine. He argues that Pyongyang\u2019s ability to pull off the successful launch of the Hwasong-14 on the first try\u2014a new missile with a longer range than any other it has fired\u2014is a sign of its prowess (para.14-18).

The announcement came hours after a launch that the United States military said had sent the missile aloft for 37 minutes. That duration, analysts said, suggested a significant improvement in the range of the North\u2019s missiles, and it might allow one to travel as far as 4,000 miles and hit Alaska. In an initial statement, the United States Pacific Command described the weapon as an intermediate-range missile rather than an intercontinental ballistic missile. But South Korean and Japanese officials said they were studying the data to determine if it was an ICBM (para. 1-3). The missile departed the Banghyon airfield in the northwestern town of Kusong and flew 578 miles before landing in the sea between North Korea and Japan, the South Korean military said in a statement. The Japanese government said the missile landed in its so-called exclusive economic zone off its western coast. Under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions, North Korea is prohibited from developing or testing ballistic missiles. While the North has made significant progress in its weapons programs, experts believe it cannot make nuclear warheads small enough to be mounted on ICBMs. Still, American policy makers have long seen just the development of an ICBM as a critical threshold the North should not be allowed to cross (para. 6). If the missile took 37 minutes to fly 578 miles, that would mean that it had a highly lofted trajectory, probably reaching an altitude of more than 1,700 miles, said David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (para 8). Such a missile would have a maximum range of roughly 4,160 miles, or 6,700 kilometers, on a standard trajectory, he said. North Korea said the missile, which it identified as the Hwasong-14, flew for 39 minutes. \u201cThat range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska,\u201d Mr. Wright wrote in a blog post. The missile looked like the longest-range missile that North Korea had ever tested, and its long flight time was \u201cmore consistent with an ICBM that can target Alaska and perhaps Hawaii,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (para. 8-11). But analysts also cautioned that although they have been impressed by the rapid and steady progress in the North\u2019s missile programs, the long flight time itself did not suggest that North Korea had mastered the complex technologies needed to build a reliable nuclear-tipped ICBM, such as the know-how to separate the nuclear warhead and guide it to its target (para.13). By lofting some of its recent missiles to higher altitudes and letting them crash down toward the earth at greater speeds, North Korea has claimed that it tested its \u201cre-entry\u201d technology, which can protect a nuclear warhead from intense heat and vibrations as it crashes through the atmosphere. But it is still unclear whether the North has successfully cleared that technological hurdle, missile experts said. Kim Dong-yub, a defense analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said that the Hwasong-12, which the North tested in May, flew 489 miles in 30 minutes, soaring to an altitude of 1,312 miles. Such a missile could deliver a standard 1,430-pound nuclear warhead over a range of 2,800 miles, not enough to reach Hawaii and Alaska, as North Korea claimed at the time (para. 13-15). Sang-Hun, C.

Abe said he will ask the presidents of China and Russia to play more constructive roles in efforts to stop the North's arms program. \"Leaders of the world will gather at the G20 meeting. I would like to strongly call for solidarity of the international community on the North Korean issue,\" Abe told reporters.

On July 3, 2017, while Americans were preparing for the 241st celebration of the Declaration of Independence, a lone rocket rose from North Korea on a near-vertical trajectory. After five to six minutes of powered flight, the second stage of the missile shut down and coasted to an altitude of about 2,720 kilometers. It then fell back to Earth, reentering the atmosphere above the Sea of Japan some 900 kilometers to the east of where it had launched. The rocket\u2019s upper stage coasted in freefall for about 32 minutes, and the overall time-of-flight, from launch to atmospheric reentry, was about 37 minutes. The launch occurred at 8:39 p.m., United States\u2019 Eastern time. Within hours, the news of the launch was trumpeted by the US mainstream press: North Korea had flown an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a missile that could carry nuclear warheads to Anchorage, Alaska, and to the continental United States as well! But the Western press apparently did not know one crucial fact: The rocket carried a reduced payload and, therefore, was able to reach a much higher altitude than would have been possible if it had instead carried the weight associated with the type of first-generation atomic bomb North Korea might possess. Experts quoted by the press apparently assumed that the rocket had carried a payload large enough to simulate the weight of such an atomic bomb, in the process incorrectly assigning a near-ICBM status to a rocket that was in reality far less capable. Only three and a half weeks later, on July 28, there was a second launch of the same type of missile, this time at night, Korean time. The rocket flew approximately the same powered flight trajectory that it had on July 3 (or July 4 in North Korea), this time, however, reaching a higher altitude\u2014a reported 3,725 kilometers. This longer flight path led to yet more unwarranted conclusions that the continental United States was now directly under threat of nuclear attack by North Korea. Actually, however, in this second case, by our calculations, the second stage of the so-called ICBM carried an even smaller payload and tumbled into the atmosphere at night over the Sea of Japan. The spectacular night-reentry of the rocket\u2014what was almost certainly the heavy front-end of the nearly empty upper stage\u2014created an impressive meteoric display that some experts mistook for the breakup of a failed warhead reentry vehicle. From the point of view of North Korean political leadership, the general reaction to the July 4 and July 28 launches could not have been better. The world suddenly believed that the North Koreans had an ICBM that could reach the West Coast of the United States and beyond. But calculations we have made\u2014based on detailed study of the type and size of the rocket motors used, the flight times of the stages of the rockets, the propellant likely used, and other technical factors\u2014indicate that these rockets actually carried very small payloads that were nowhere near the weight of a nuclear warhead of the type North Korea could have, or could eventually have. These small payloads allowed the rockets to be lofted to far higher altitudes than they would have if loaded with a much-heavier warhead, creating the impression that North Korea was on the cusp of achieving ICBM capability. In reality, the North Korean rocket fired twice last month\u2014the Hwasong-14\u2014is a \u201csub-level\u201d ICBM that will not be able to deliver nuclear warheads to the continental United States. Our analysis shows that the current variant of the Hwasong-14 may not even be capable of delivering a first-generation nuclear warhead to Anchorage, Alaska, although such a possibility cannot be categorically ruled out. But even if North Korea is now capable of fabricating a relatively light-weight, \u201cminiaturized\u201d atomic bomb that can survive the extreme reentry environments of long-range rocket delivery, it will, with certainty, not be able to deliver such an atomic bomb to the lower 48 states of the United States with the rocket tested on July 3 and July 28. First, the bottom line. In each of the two North Korean tests in July, the rockets were fired on a trajectory that sent them to high altitudes; on these trajectories, the rockets travelled relatively short horizontal distances. But after the tests, analysts projected the maximum range the rockets could have traveled by assuming that they could have been placed on trajectories that would result in a maximum achievable range, rather than a maximum achievable altitude. For example, the 2,720-kilometer altitude achieved by the July 3 rocket was determined by its burnout speed. If it is assumed that the rocket could achieve roughly the same burnout speed on a trajectory that is shaped for maximum range, it would be sufficient to carry the payload to Anchorage, Alaska. In the case of the July 28 test, the same rocket achieved a higher burnout speed and a higher altitude\u2014about 3,725 kilometers. If it were again assumed that the rocket\u2019s trajectory is shaped for maximum range instead of maximum altitude, the new higher burnout speed would be able to carry the payload to Seattle, Washington. Figure 1 below shows the trajectories flown on July 4 and July 28 that were misinterpreted as tests of a North Korean rocket capable of delivering atomic bombs to the continental United States. Figure 1. The highly lofted rocket trajectories for the burnout speeds achieved in the July 4 and the July 28 tests are shown on the left side of the figure. The center and right side of the figure show alternative rocket trajectories that could instead have been flown with loft angles optimized for maximum range instead of for maximum altitude. One question is not answered by this basic kinematic study of the July 4 and July 28 tests: How did the rocket achieve its burnout speed? That\u2019s to say, what kind of rocket motors did it need to achieve the resulting burnout speed, what was the rocket\u2019s launch weight, and most, important, what was the payload-weight carried by the rocket? Figure 2 shows a summary of our estimates of the range versus the weight of atomic bomb that might be carried by a Hwasong-14 missile, derived from our technical analysis of the Hwasong-14\u2019s weight and propulsive capabilities and the likely weight of a North Korean nuclear warhead. The analysis results summarized in the graph are for two different \u201cdesigns\u201d of the Hwasong-14. The first design uses published information about the powered flight time of the second stages of the rockets and is reflected by the red curves in Figure 2. Those two curves correspond to reported second-stage flight times of 224 and 233 seconds for the two rocket tests. We have received two independent confirmations of these published flight times from sources that we believe to be reliable. As those curves show, if the North Koreans have achieved the capability of creating a missile warhead as light-weight as those used by the Chinese and Pakistani militaries\u2014no small feat for a country with means as limited as North Korea\u2019s\u2014the two missiles fired in July could carry that missile roughly 6,000 kilometers, approximately the distance to Anchorage, Alaska. The missiles simply could not carry such a warhead to the lower 48 states. The second design\u2014reflected by the blue curves in Figure 2\u2014assumes that the North Koreans actually use more efficient rocket motors than are indicated by the information published in major media about the powered flight trajectory of the second upper stage. In this second design, we assumed that the rocket\u2019s upper stage would be powered by rocket motors similar to those with characteristics demonstrated in the top stages of the North Korean Unha-3 and the Iranian Safir Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). We believe North Korea is capable of building such a variant of the Hwasong-14, and that variant could have the capability to deliver a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska, and slightly beyond. But neither variant of the Hwasong-14 we have studied could carry a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb to any part of the continental United States beyond Alaska. Atomic bomb weights\u2014without the hype. At this time, no one outside of North Korea has solid information about the characteristics of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons designs\u2014especially about whether or not the weapons that have been tested are cumbersome laboratory devices or readily militarized designs that could be put into bombs or carried on ballistic missiles. This information is simply not available at this time. We are therefore left to speculate based on intelligence information that we have from other sources and on an understanding of the very significant technical problems of design and implementation that must be solved to be able to build and deliver atomic bombs by ICBM. There is general information about an atomic bomb design that was obtained by Pakistan from China, and by Libya from Pakistan. A.Q. Khan, a Pakistani known to have trafficked equipment and information that would facilitate the building of atomic bombs, is reported to have sold that design to Libya. Khan is known to have sold uranium enrichment gas-centrifuge technology to North Korea; it is very likely he also shared atomic bomb design information similar to what he sold Libya. It is reported that the bomb design Khan sold to Libya and possibly to North Korea would produce a warhead that weighed about 500 kilograms and yielded about 10 kilotons, if properly implemented. All of the original design information from China was for devices that were aimed at assembling uranium 235 cores. This information could have been modified and used by North Korea to implement similar implosion devices to instead assemble plutonium 239 cores. However, these devices would have had to be developed and modified from the original designs. This information is consistent with the seismic data from Pakistan\u2019s nuclear tests in 1998, which suggest that the yield of atomic bombs tested by Pakistan is between 10 and 15 kilotons. It is also consistent with the seismic data from North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests, which indicate maximum explosive yields of perhaps 10 to 20 kilotons. North Korea has publicly displayed what it claims to be a standardized atomic bomb that dimensional analysis indicates could weigh as little as 400 kilograms. The device displayed by North Korea is clearly a spherical implosion design\u2014seemingly based on the same design concept that Khan sold to Libya and used by Pakistan. (If North Korea had instead sought to impress the outside world by displaying an atomic bomb that was shaped somewhat like an egg, it could have indicated an entirely different and far more advanced design.) But the payload of a missile consists of more than a warhead. Because of the extreme environments created by long-range missile reentry to the atmosphere\u2014including temperatures in the thousands of degrees and high deceleration forces\u2014we have assumed that 25 percent of the payload-weight of these North Korean rockets would have to be given over to a heat shield and the structure needed to hold an atomic bomb in place during deceleration. This is an intentional underestimate of the weight of the warhead assembly, to make our assessment of the Hwasong-14\u2019s capabilities as favorable to North Korean capabilities as possible. In this extremely conservative estimate, and as a result of a review of the very sketchy information about nuclear weapons design information that has leaked from China to Pakistan and beyond, we think that a reasonable guess for the minimum weight of an advanced first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb that is able to survive the extreme environments associated with ICBM delivery could be as low as 500 to 600 kilograms. In our view, the engineering challenges of implementing a nuclear weapon are substantial and highly dependent on material resources, national experience, and the skill and depth of knowledge of scientists, engineers, and technicians involved at every level of the enterprise. As such, it cannot be ruled out that a North Korean weaponized device could weigh considerably more than 600 kilograms or less than 500 kilograms, but we believe it is overwhelmingly likely that it would not weigh less than 500. Our estimates show that the Hwasong-14, using the publicly reported burn times for the upper rocket stage, could deliver a nuclear warhead only as far as Anchorage, Alaska if the warhead weighed 500 kilograms to 550 kilograms. To reach Seattle, the warhead would have to be substantially smaller, weighing no more than 300 kilos. We believe that an advanced North Korean weaponized atomic bomb would be unlikely to weigh less than 500 to 600 kilograms. So it is entirely possible that this variant of the Hwasong-14 will not be able to deliver an atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska. If the upper stage of the Hwasong-14 were instead fitted with the more capable vernier motors from the SS-N-6 submarine launched ballistic missile (known in Russia as the R-27), it could potentially deliver an atomic bomb to Anchorage, if the bomb weighed less than between 650 and 750 kg. The same upgraded variant of the Hwasong-14 could only deliver an atomic bomb to Seattle if the bomb weighed less than between 400 and 450 kg. Since it is extremely unlikely that a first-generation weaponized North Korean atomic bomb would weigh substantially less than 500 kilograms, we conclude that neither variant of the Hwasong-14 missile could deliver a first-generation North Korean atomic bomb to the continental United States. We emphasize at this point that advances in rocketry demonstrated by North Korea in the Hwasong-14 are significant, and although the Hwasong-14 is not an immediate threat to the continental United States, variants that are almost certainly now under development, but probably years away from completion, will eventually become missiles with sufficient payloads to deliver atomic bombs to the continental United States. Performance assessment of the Hwasong-14. Like any missile system, the actual lifting and range capability of the Hwasong-14 depends on many technical details. Among these are the type of fuel burned by the missile, the efficiency of its rocket motors, the total amount of propellant carried in each stage, the weight of the missile\u2019s airframe, and the weight of different components, including rocket motors, plumbing, guidance and control systems, and the like. In the case of the Hwasong-14, almost all of the critical parameters that ultimately determine the rocket\u2019s ability to carry a payload-weight to a given range can be deduced from photographs, videos of its initial powered flight, engineering knowledge of rocket systems, and specific other engineering information that can be determined by other observations of the missile and its motor components. For example, the performance characteristics of the main rocket motor that powers the first stage are well known. This is in part because the rocket motor has been unambiguously identified as derived from components of a well-known family of Russian rocket motors. The type of propellant used by this family of motors is also known\u2014unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), a highly energetic propellant combination used extensively in Russian rocket systems. The dimensions of the Hwasong-14 are readily determined from photographs of the missile and its length, as measured relative to the known length of the Chinese-made vehicle that carries it. Since the density of the propellant is known, and the dimensions of the rocket stages and the functions of the different sections of the rocket stages are easily identified, very good estimates of the weights of the stages, airframes and rocket motors can be deduced from simple volumetric analysis and knowledge of design features. Although many of the refined details of the rocket may not be known, the general information of the type described above provides quite good estimates of how well the rocket will perform. These data lead to an overall weight estimate of roughly 37 metric tons for the Hwasong-14. The known characteristics of the main first-stage rocket motor, and the observed rate of acceleration of the rocket at launch, result in a highly constrained check on the missile model we created to estimate its overall range and payload performance. One critical parameter of the Hwasong-14 is not yet known with certainty: the exact powered flight time of the second stage. This parameter is an important factor in determining the overall performance of the Hwasong-14, due to a phenomenon known among rocket engineers as \u201cgravitational losses\u201d during powered flight. To perhaps oversimplify the physics involved, the longer the rocket motor burns against the gravitational pull of the Earth, the less efficiently it accelerates its payload to a final speed. But two articles in The Diplomat magazine have included flight times for the second stages of the rockets that North Korea launched in July. Two independent sources have confirmed those times to us as accurate. Figure 3 shows photographs extracted from North Korean videos of the launches of the Hwasong-14 missile during the morning of July 4 (in North Korea; the evening of July 3 in the United States) and during the night-launch on July 28. Careful examination shows that the first stage of the Hwasong-14 is powered by a large single rocket motor supported by 4 small \u201cvernier\u201d motors that are used to change the direction of the rocket during powered flight and to maintain its vertical stability during its initial lift-off and vertical acceleration. North Korea has also released videos of tests of the Hwasong-14 rocket motor (shown firing on a test stand in Figure 4). We have identified this rocket motor as a being derived from a family of Russian rocket motors known as the RD-250 or RD-251. The original motors used six thrust chambers fed by three turbo pumps to together generate roughly about 240 tons (about 530,000 pounds) of lift. The North Koreans probably obtained this motor and many others as part of a vast shipment of rocket components to North Korea that occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the simultaneous disintegration of the national economy and political system of the Soviet Union. Until recently, almost all of the liquid-propellant motors seen in North Korea\u2019s rockets could be traced back to the Makayev Institute, a vast and highly capable organization that was responsible for the design of all types of Soviet ballistic missiles. Because of the prominent role of Makayev in Soviet ballistic missile production, this institute would have had large numbers of rocket motors in storage that were used to build various models of SCUDs and the SS-N-6 submarine-launched ballistic missile (aka R-27) used on Russian Yankee class submarines.\nThe newest Russian rocket motor we have identified in the North Korean arsenal, derived from the RD-250/251 and used in the Hwasong-14, is not from the Makayev Institute, but from an entirely different major rocket motor manufacturer, NPO Energomash, which supported the OKB-456 Design Bureau in the Soviet Union. This rocket motor was associated with rocket and space launch vehicles produced in Ukraine. The presence of RD-250/251 rocket components in a new North Korean rocket raises new and potentially ominous questions about the variety and extent to which Soviet rocket motors might have been obtained by North Korea during the collapse of the Soviet Union. The adaptation that North Korean engineers have worked, using components from the powerful RD 250/251 rocket motor, can be appreciated by examining Figure 5. The original RD 250/251 was a rocket motor that consisted of six thrust chambers, driven by three powerful turbo pumps. This rocket engine can be seen in the image on the left in figure 5. Each of the three turbo pumps in the original rocket engine was nested between two thrust chambers, at a height below the combustion chamber and above the gas exhaust nozzle of each thrust chamber. This clever design made it possible to shorten the length of the rocket motor compartment and to reduce the overall length of the first stage of a rocket. The image on the right in figure 5 is an enlargement taken from Figure 4, a photo of the Hwasong-14 rocket motor firing on a test stand. The outline of the motor\u2019s thrust chamber is shown in a silhouette overlay and the location of the turbopump next to the single thrust chamber is shown to be exactly at the height of the turbopump in the RD 250/251 motor complex. It is clear that the final rocket motor mounted in the Hwasong-14 has this single powerful turbopump feeding propellant to both the main rocket motor and the four smaller vernier motors used to control the direction of the missile. The design indicates a well-thought-out approach to a completely new missile that was not seen in public until the launch of the Hwasong-12, which was essentially a test aimed at proving the functionality of the first stage of the two-stage Hwasong-14. It is a remarkable achievement in itself that North Korea has been able to master the use of these components well enough to be able to adapt them to their special purposes. We have determined that the approximate properties of the Hwasong-14 missile, with a second stage upgraded with more capable vernier motors from the Russian R-27 missile, will be as follows: General conclusions\u2014for now. Our general conclusions from intensive study of a wide variety of data relating to the two rockets that North Korea launched in July: The Hwasong-14 does not currently constitute a nuclear threat to the lower 48 states of the United States.\nThe flight tests on July 4 and 28 were a carefully choreographed deception by North Korea to create a false impression that the Hwasong-14 is a near-ICBM that poses a nuclear threat to the continental US.\nThe Hwasong-14 tested on July 4 and 28 may not even be able to deliver a North Korean atomic bomb to Anchorage, Alaska.\nAlthough it is clear that North Korea is not capable of manufacturing sophisticated rocket components, their skill and ingenuity in using Soviet rocket motor components has grown very substantially.

The claim indicates the regime has continued to advance its missile technology since its leader Kim Jong-un said during his annual address on Jan. 1 that the regime was in the final stage of developing ICBM technology. On Thursday, the North fired what appeared to be several short-range anti-ship cruise missiles from its east coast in the latest series of missile tests in defiance of international sanctions, according to the South Korean military. They flew some 200 kilometers. It marked the fifth missile test-fire by the North since liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office May 10. Pyongyang has recently launched different types of missiles, including a new intermediate-range ballistic missile and a surface-to-air missile. \"The great success of test-firing an intercontinental ballistic missile, which we are sure to achieve, will mark a historic watershed moment in the failure of the U.S. hostile policy against us,\" the editorial in the ruling Workers' Party's mouthpiece read. \"Historically speaking, the U.S. has never dared to go to war with a country that possesses nuclear weapons or ICBMs.\"    It also warned that it has the technology to strike the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile\""], [1034, "2017-06-11T07:09:24Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-11T03:53:30Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-10T16:55:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-10T13:01:06Z", [0.02], ""], [14572, "2017-06-10T08:36:03Z", [0.2], ""], [1034, "2017-06-10T08:18:08Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-09T19:54:24Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-09T18:52:21Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-06-09T14:29:42Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-09T14:23:50Z", [0.0], "http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2017/06/09/0301000000AEN20170609008151315.html"], [1034, "2017-06-09T06:34:04Z", [0.0], ""], [35398, "2017-06-09T04:03:00Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-06-09T03:27:08Z", [0.09], ""], [34613, "2017-06-09T01:45:25Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2017-06-08T22:54:27Z", [0.05], ""], [16284, "2017-06-08T18:54:11Z", [0.15], ""], [368, "2017-06-08T18:43:29Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-08T11:54:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-08T11:41:35Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2017-06-08T05:40:08Z", [0.0], ""], [35960, "2017-06-08T04:33:12Z", [0.2], ""], [755, "2017-06-08T00:07:57Z", [0.05], "The Daily Mail, June 7, 'BREAKING NEWS - North Korea fires multiple land-to-ship missiles off its east coast in latest round of arms tests': http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4582824/North-Korea-fires-multiple-missiles-east-coast.html\nClip from article:\n\"In total four cruise missiles were fired from the North Korean coastal city of Wonsan, Gangwon Province, a US defense official told CNN.\"  "], [4273, "2017-06-07T23:52:15Z", [0.18], ""], [16652, "2017-06-07T22:12:04Z", [0.19], ""], [368, "2017-06-07T19:24:51Z", [0.0], ""], [22689, "2017-06-07T17:52:11Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-07T16:23:11Z", [0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-06-07T12:43:52Z", [0.12], ""], [34353, "2017-06-07T11:58:16Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-07T07:04:24Z", [0.0], ""], [32851, "2017-06-06T23:39:57Z", [0.01], ""], [18207, "2017-06-06T20:15:36Z", [0.04], ""], [28091, "2017-06-06T18:49:32Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2017-06-06T18:18:14Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-06T12:36:05Z", [0.02], ""], [34353, "2017-06-06T11:55:35Z", [0.0], ""], [32723, "2017-06-06T10:44:32Z", [1.0], "Regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Drohgeb\u00e4rden und St\u00e4rkepr\u00e4sentationen sind das typische Verhalten eines  \u00f6ffentlichen Gewaltherrschers  "], [1034, "2017-06-06T06:09:52Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-05T21:32:11Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-05T17:24:11Z", [0.0], ""], [32851, "2017-06-05T17:19:24Z", [0.02], ""], [2965, "2017-06-05T15:48:53Z", [0.0], ""], [22833, "2017-06-05T15:13:00Z", [0.01], ""], [34353, "2017-06-05T12:26:52Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-05T06:03:37Z", [0.0], ""], [35924, "2017-06-05T02:36:08Z", [0.0], ""], [554, "2017-06-05T00:22:59Z", [0.65], ""], [368, "2017-06-04T18:02:08Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-06-04T15:55:58Z", [0.0], ""], [32851, "2017-06-04T06:47:13Z", [0.08], ""], [1034, "2017-06-04T06:00:36Z", [0.0], ""], [28474, "2017-06-04T00:55:22Z", [0.99], ""], [755, "2017-06-03T21:49:03Z", [0.05], "\"My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system battery was initially deployed in March in the southeastern region of Seongju with just two of its maximum load of six launchers to counter a growing North Korean missile threat. During his successful campaign for the May 9 presidential election, Moon called for a parliamentary review of the system, whose deployment has also infuriated China, North Korea's lone major ally. \"President Moon said it was very shocking\" to hear the four additional launchers had been installed without being reported to the new government or to the public, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan told a media briefing.

The missile was believed to be a Scud-class ballistic missile and flew about 450 km (280 miles), South Korean officials said. North Korea has a large stockpile of the short-range missiles, originally developed by the Soviet Union. Monday's launch followed two successful tests of medium-to-long-range missiles in as many weeks by the North, which has been conducting such tests at an unprecedented pace in an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the mainland United States. North Korea was likely showing its determination to push ahead in the face of international pressure to rein in its missile program and \"to pressure the (South Korean) government to change its policy on the North,\" South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said. It was the third ballistic missile test launch since South Korea's liberal President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10 pledging to engage with the reclusive neighbor in dialogue. Moon says sanctions alone have failed to resolve the growing threat from the North's advancing nuclear and missile program. The missile reached an altitude of 120 km (75 miles), Roh said. \"The assessment is there was at least one missile but we are analyzing the number of missiles,\" he said. North Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile tests and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016 in defiance of U.N.

The missile probably isn\u2019t truly operational at this stage, but is more likely entering a pre-operational training period. It will likely take another year or so to achieve reliable and accurate performance from the missile, train the launch crews, and establish a mass production capability. This is about what we expected in terms of the timeline, only the explicit announcement comes as any sort of surprise. While North Korea already has the ability to attack their regional adversaries\u2014South Korea and Japan\u2014with their current arsenal, the KN-15 provides a robust second strike capability for deterrence purposes. And early deployment, even of an unreliable missile in limited numbers, may suit that purpose.\n........\nIf the North has any plans to develop a precision-guided maneuvering reentry vehicle, the KN-15 is certainly where they will want to deploy it. But it is quite possible they are doing most of the testing using cheap, reliable Scud missiles; they may have taken the opportunity to fly just the imaging sensor and telemetry system on this flight. At some point in the future when the KN-15 and the guided MaRV are both working separately, they could be mated into a single system. But MaRVs are a notoriously difficult technology to perfect, and that will likely take more than a year; quite possibly even more than a decade. Implications Even if mass production of the KN-15 were to start today, it would take more than a year to produce a significant stockpile of these missiles. At its peak, North Korea could manufacture about 50 Nodong missiles each year. It is unlikely it will be able to manufacture KN-15 missiles at a higher rate, and even 50 missiles per year will require a great deal of troubleshooting on the assembly line. From an engineering standpoint, the transition from hand-crafted prototypes to mass production is almost as challenging as developing the prototypes in the first place. This means, North Korea could begin deploying the KN-15 missile this year, but only in limited numbers and most likely just for training purposes. Within a year or so, the missile could achieve what we would call initial operational capability (IOC), the point at which missiles could reliably be used in combat, albeit still in limited numbers. It will likely take at least five years for the KN-15 to replace the Scud-ER and Nodong as the mainstay of North Korea\u2019s strategic missile force, and even then, only in a first-generation version with a non-maneuvering warhead. If and when this happens, it will give North Korea a robust second-strike capability against targets in South Korea and Japan. It is important to remember that if all Pyonyang wants is the ability to conduct a surprise attack against their local adversaries, they can do that right now with their current arsenal. The purpose of the KN-15 is to give them the ability to retaliate if they are the victims of someone else\u2019s first strike, and to credibly threaten retaliation in order to deter an attack in the first place. And early deployment, even of an unreliable missile in limited numbers, may suit that purpose.\" I infer there is no way an ICBM could be launched before 11-1\nBut I am often wrong and the only solid prediction re Kim III is that DPRK is inherently unpredictable\nand that Kim III  will use any means  necessary to demonstrate a nuclear deterrent that is viable to forestall; even a thought of a decapitation or regime change strategy by US and its allies"], [16652, "2017-05-24T14:17:09Z", [0.11], ""], [34353, "2017-05-24T12:14:42Z", [0.36], ""], [1034, "2017-05-24T09:27:28Z", [0.0], ""], [35618, "2017-05-24T06:22:30Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-24T05:05:41Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2017-05-24T02:14:07Z", [0.0], ""], [35768, "2017-05-23T22:12:49Z", [0.05], ""], [35315, "2017-05-23T14:35:37Z", [0.12], ""], [2965, "2017-05-23T13:13:50Z", [0.0], ""], [34353, "2017-05-23T12:05:59Z", [0.36], ""], [1034, "2017-05-23T06:07:42Z", [0.0], ""], [35748, "2017-05-23T03:07:32Z", [0.15], ""], [14253, "2017-05-23T02:03:39Z", [0.19], ""], [2965, "2017-05-22T21:34:57Z", [0.0], "Reaffirm.

A South Korean military official said the missile appeared to be an upgraded, extended-range version of the North's solid-fuel submarine-launched missile. The missile fired a week ago flew was liquid-fueled, and flew further. North Korea has defied all calls to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, even from China, its lone major ally, saying the weapons are needed for legitimate self-defense. The reclusive state has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. On Saturday, it said it had developed the capability to strike the U.S. mainland, although Western missile experts say the claim is exaggerated. The United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday behind closed doors to discuss the latest test at the request of the United States, Japan and South Korea, diplomats said on Sunday. An official traveling with U.S. President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia said the White House was aware of the latest launch and noted that the missile had a shorter range than the three previous missiles that North Korea had tested. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said economic and diplomatic pressure would continue to be applied to North Korea. \"The ongoing testing is disappointing, disturbing and we ask that they cease that,\" he said in an interview with \"Fox News Sunday\". The two missile tests in a week complicate plans by South Korea's new President Moon Jae-in to seek ways to reduce tension on the peninsula. Moon took office eleven days ago after winning an election on a platform of a more moderate approach to the North, with which the South is still technically at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of their 1950-1953 conflict. South Korea's foreign ministry said the tests were \"reckless and irresponsible actions throwing cold water over the hopes and desires of this new government and the international community for denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula\". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the latest missile test by the reclusive North was \"a snub and a challenge to international efforts for a peaceful resolution\". Abe told reporters after a meeting of Japan's National Security Council that he wanted to raise the issue of North Korean missile launches at the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Italy this month.

If North Korea develops a missile that can reach the U.S. homeland, and former CIA acting director and Cipher Brief expert Michael Morell says we should assume they can, then what defensive options are available to the United States? In reality there is only one: the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (GMD). The GMD is an expansive\u2014and expensive\u2014system that comprises sensors based at sea, on land, and in space and a command and control network that feed data to an interceptor that is itself a three-stage rocket called the ground-based interceptor. Each sixty-foot tall interceptor carries what is called the \u201cexoatmospheric kill vehicle\u201d (EKV) into space and deploys it in the path of the enemy missile.

The isolated country has been developing a long-range missile capable of striking the mainland United States mounted with a nuclear warhead. That would require a flight of 8,000 km (4,800 miles) or more and technology to ensure a warhead's stable re-entry into the atmosphere. The North's official KCNA news agency said the new strategic ballistic missile named Hwasong-12, fired on Sunday at the highest angle to avoid affecting neighboring countries' security, flew 787 km (489 miles) on a trajectory reaching an altitude of 2,111.5 km (1,312 miles). The details reported by KCNA were largely consistent with South Korean and Japanese assessments that it flew further and higher than an intermediate-range missile (IRBM) tested in February from the same region, northwest of Pyongyang. Such an altitude meant it was launched at a high trajectory, which would limit the lateral distance traveled. But if it was fired at a standard trajectory, it would have a range of at least 4,000 km (2,500 miles), experts said. The test \"represents a level of performance never before seen from a North Korean missile\", John Schilling, an aerospace expert, said in an analysis on the U.S.-based 38 North website. \"It appears to have not only demonstrated an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that might enable them to reliably strike the U.S. base at Guam, but more importantly, may represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\" KCNA said the test launch verified the homing feature of the warhead that allowed it to survive \"under the worst re-entry situation\" and accurately detonate. The claim, if true, could mark an advancement in the North's ICBM program exceeding most expectations, said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at Kyungnam University's Institute of Far Eastern Studies in Seoul (para.1-9).

In the past three years, North Korea has launched more major missiles than in the three previous decades combined. That acceleration is one of the most dramatic signs of leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s push to overhaul the country\u2019s weapons program since he took power in late 2011. He has modernized production of nuclear and missile parts, upgraded the program within the military hierarchy and overtly pampered engineers, forcing Western leaders to worry more about Pyongyang\u2019s intentions than ever before. On Sunday, North Korea launched a newly developed intermediate-range missile, its 10th missile firing this year. Mr. Kim attended the test of the nuclear-capable missile and described it as a \u201cperfect weapon system,\u201d according to a state media report. Initial projections from several experts suggested it would be able to reach U.S. military forces in Guam (para. 1-4). Weapons experts who study satellite images and photos released by North Korea say the newer machines have become ubiquitous in North Korean missile plants. The machines allow faster, more precise manufacturing of parts around the clock, reducing the need to skirt sanctions by importing similar parts. The United Nations bans any imports that could be used in weapons programs. (para. 14). Weaponry in a military parade in April in Pyongyang to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Mr. Kim, included rocket casings that might have been made by the new CNC machines, missile experts say. North Korea also showed off what appeared to be at least one new long-range missile (para. 14-15). 10th missile launch The launch spurred expectations among analysts that North Korea would successfully launch a similar missile before long, possibly within months. On April 28, North Korea fired its ninth missile so far this year. Sunday\u2019s launch was immediately seen as another sign of progress (para. 50). Some analysts say North Korea\u2019s record of exaggeration makes them cautious about its claim of being able to mount a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile that could reach the U.S. North Korea hasn\u2019t tested its KN-08 missile, the gravest potential threat in the country\u2019s arsenal. \u201cThe motive may also be threat demonstration, but they are making real progress,\u201d says John Schilling, a rocket and missile specialist at the Aerospace Corp., which runs a research center for the U.S. Air Force (para. 51-52).

It appears to have not only demonstrated an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) that might enable them to reliably strike the US base at Guam, but more importantly, may represent a substantial advance to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Given speculation over the past months about the possibility of military action by the Trump administration to prevent Pyongyang from acquiring such a weapons, the possible testing of ICBM subsystems in this low-key manner may be a North Korean hedge against the possibility of such action. We are still awaiting more details on this test, and if the North Koreans follow their usual practice we can expect photographs soon. But unless Pyongyang is hiding something completely new, there's only one real candidate for this missile. During last month's parade, one genuinely new missile was revealed - one that looks very much like a small, two-stage version of their three-stage KN-08 ICBM prototype, on displayed on a mobile launcher previously used for the \"Musudan\" intermediate-range ballistic missile. We don't have a name for this missile yet; the \"KN-17\" designation has been used for both this system and for a Scud-derived short-range ballistic missile with a maneuvering reentry vehicle displayed in the same parade. But whatever the name, it would be expected to have about the same performance as the missile just launched. While the April 15 parade may be the first time this missile was seen, and yesterday's test may be its first successful flight, there have been earlier indications that such a missile was under development. In January this year, intelligence sources reported that North Korea had deployed two prototype ICBMs at a test site, just under 15 meters long. All of North Korea's ICBM prototypes and mock-ups are well over that size, which left us puzzled. But this new missile comes in at just under 15 meters, and while its performance doesn't quite reach ICBM standards it clearly shares a common heritage with the KN-08 ICBM.

That is a \u201cconsiderably longer range than its current missiles,\u201d said David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, in an analysis of the launch (para. 1-6).

In its previous missile test from Kusong, North Korea launched what the Pentagon called \u201ca medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile\u201d from the Banghyon air base on Feb. 12. The missile, which was identified as a Pukguksong-2, flew 310 miles. The test was conducted as Mr. Trump was hosting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Mr. Abe, on an official visit (para. 23). North Korea has said its intermediate-range Pukguksong-2 could carry a nuclear payload. The missile was also fired from a mobile-launch vehicle and used a solid-fuel technology that missile experts say will make it easier to hide it and launch on short notice. North Korea has been trying to build a reliable intermediate-range ballistic missile, which would be capable of reaching American military bases in the Pacific.

Suppression can be accomplished both by physically destroying the systems or by disrupting and deceiving them through electronic warfare. In modern warfare SEAD missions can constitute as much as 30% of all sorties launched in the first week of combat and continue at a reduced rate through the rest of a campaign. One quarter of American combat sorties in recent conflicts have been SEAD missions.

'This expands the aircraft\u2019s weapons mix of Hellfire missiles and GBU-12 Paveway II bombs. The use of the JDAM marks a potentially important expansion of the drone\u2019s combat capability, pushing it closer to the weapons mix \u2014 though not the capacity \u2014 of a so-called fast mover fighter like the F-16 or F-15.' Joint Direct Attack Munition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Direct_Attack_Munition\nThe Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or \"dumb bombs\", into all-weather \"smart\" munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 pounds (227 kg) to 2,000 pounds (907 kg). When installed on a bomb, the JDAM kit is given a GBU (Guided Bomb Unit) nomenclature, superseding the Mark 80 or BLU (Bomb, Live Unit) nomenclature of the bomb to which it is attached.\nThe JDAM is not a stand-alone weapon; rather it is a \"bolt-on\" guidance package that converts unguided gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions (PGMs). The key components of the system consist of a tail section with aerodynamic control surfaces, a (body) strake kit, and a combined inertial guidance system and GPS guidance control unit.\nThe JDAM was meant to improve upon laser-guided bomb and imaging infrared technology, which can be hindered by bad ground and weather conditions. Laser seekers are now being fitted to some JDAMs.\nFrom 1998 to November 2016, Boeing completed over 300,000 JDAM guidance kits, and is now building them at a rate of over 130 kits per day. 126 MQ-9s in inventory:\nUAVs in the U.S. military: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAVs_in_the_U.S._military Source: Wikipedia Comments: How about sending 1MM KPA across the DMZ in a surprise attack instead?

The Dead Drop is a source of fun or intriguing news you can't get anywhere else. Got a tip for us? Email us at thedeaddrop@thecipherbrief.com and share the scoop. We promise to protect our sources and methods. Below is our recent intelligence collection: PDDNI 2B? The Dead Drop is hearing that Sue Gordon, currently the Deputy Director at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is the leading candidate to become the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence under DNI Dan Coats.  Gordon spent more than 25 years at the CIA and led the Agency\u2019s Information Operations Center while simultaneously being the CIA Director\u2019s senior advisor on cyber. She is well-known and liked in Silicon Valley, which would be an asset in her new position.  The PDDNI position is currently vacant and requires Senate confirmation.  Just last month, the number three position at DNI \u2013 the Deputy Director of National Intelligence (without the \u201cPrincipal\u201d in the title) job was filed by Dawn Eilenberger \u2013 who, most recently was the Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Policy & Strategy at the ODNI.  Eilenberger also served as IG at NGA and started her intelligence career at the CIA. COMMISSAR, WE HARDLY KNEW YE: Way back on February 3rd, The Dead Drop told you about plans to install \u201cliaison officers\u201d from the NSC in the front offices at the various intelligence community components to keep an eye on political purity.  Some observers likened the jobs to the zampolits or political commissars of the old Soviet Union.  The idea soon spread to the entire cabinet, where minders were assigned to make sure Departments were towing the political line.  Now Politico reports that the thought police \u2013 who they dubbed \u201cchaperones\u201d \u2013 are being phased out after it became apparent what a bad idea the positions were. KGB LEFT NO STONE UN-SPUN: Interesting story in The Daily Beast last week says that the widespread belief that the CIA was behind JFK\u2019s assassination was the direct result of a KGB influence operation \u2013 one that ended up inspiring years of bogus conspiracy theories \u2013 including those promoted in Oliver Stone\u2019s movie, \u201cJFK.\u201d NATIONAL PARK SERVICE GOES OUT ON A LIMB FOR OSS VETS: Prince William Forest Park and the OSS Society are hosting an event on June 24th to reflect on the historical legacy of the OSS. Eastern National Bookstore, a cooperating partner with the National Park Service, is providing a free dinner to all OSS veterans and their spouses.  Since 2017 is the 75th anniversary year of the OSS, we suspect they won't go broke with that free offer.  The rest of us can attend too for just $12 per person to enjoy the meal and remarks by historian and author Patrick O'Donnell.  The event starts at 5PM (1700 for your OSS vets) at the OSS Theater at Prince William Forest Park in Dumfries, VA.  To attend contact Chris Alford at chris_alford@nps.gov or call 703-221-7183. HULU HULLABALOO:  The streaming TV service Hulu announced this week they are starting work on a 10-part adaptation of Lawrence Wright\u2019s critically acclaimed 2006 book, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11. The book provided a detailed look at the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and events leading up to 9/11.  What garnered media attention this week, however, was the news that Alec Baldwin has signed on to play CIA Director George Tenet.  Insiders tell us that when Wright was working on his book in the aftermath of 9/11, the FBI was exceedingly cooperative \u2013 but that the CIA, then under the leadership of Porter Goss, elected not to be.  As a result, The Looming Tower leans heavily on the FBI\u2019s version of events. POCKET LITTER: Bits and pieces of interesting /weird stuff we discovered: Fruit of the Loon: Former CIA analyst John Nixon was on NPR\u2019s program \u201cWait Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me\u201d last week talking about his book Debriefing the President \u2013 which describes his experiences interrogating Saddam Hussein.  Part of the price of promotion on NPR was that Nixon had to endure a three-question quiz on a different kind of briefs \u2013 men\u2019s underwear.  He got two of the three wrong \u2013 but we don\u2019t want to hear about intelligence failures.  They were tough questions.\nThrown onto the bus \u2013 not under it.  On Tuesday, members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, including Chairman Senator Richard Burr, were spotted boarding a chartered bus on Capitol Hill believed to be bound for CIA headquarters in Virginia where they were expected to be briefed on the ongoing investigation into possible Russian meddling in the U.S. election. When asked where they were heading, CNN says Burr replied, \u201cSlow news day?\u201d \nState of the World Explained: With Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas meeting with President Trump this week \u2013 we thought we would share with you this nugget (via The Jerusalem Post) which says that, according to a Palestinian Authority TV host, Israel is waging war against the Muslim world via \u201csex mania.\u201d In addition, the commentator claims the CIA has created a branch called the \u201cUnit for Creating the Global Mood,\u201d which distributes \u201cpain killers, mood enhancers and hallucinatory substances\u201d to \u201cdestroy what remains of our children\u2019s values.\u201d\nSighted Sheep Sank (by) Same: Late last week came news that a Russian naval intelligence ship collided with a merchant freighter carrying 8,800 sheep in the Black Sea. The Russian vessel, the Liman, came out decidedly worst in the encounter. It sank. Fortunately, all 78 sailors onboard survived \u2013 which allows us to enjoy the observation that Putin\u2019s Navy must be embarrassed by losing a modern ship to a \u201cewe boat.\u201d\nNETWORK NEWS: Not a day goes by when members of The Cipher Brief Network aren\u2019t making news.  Here are just a few examples from this week: Guess who\u2019s coming to dinner! John McLaughlin, former acting CIA Director  \u2013 speaking with NBC News on President Trump inviting Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to the White House noting that the president \"seems to admire strength and power in other leaders inordinately. Without looking at the downsides of how they exercise that power.\"\nGenerally speaking: NPR last week looked at what many consider the \u201cmoderating\u201d effect of the generals appointed to prime positions in the Trump administration.  General Jack Keane told NPR that Secretary of Defense (and fellow retired general) Jim Mattis has been effective in reaching out and reassuring allies in the Middle East.\nSeeing Red: Former DNI James Clapper speaking at the Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday said he had no doubt that Russia successfully interfered with the presidential election and \u201cclearly favored\u201d Trump over Hillary Clinton. Michael Morell, former acting CIA director and another TCB network member was also at the event, according to the Harvard Gazette, and participated in the discussion.\nWith all due respect: Ambassador Joe DeTrani spoke with NPR this week following reports that North Korea has detained a third American citizen. What does Kim Jong un expect to get from actions like this?  DeTrani says \u201cthey make it very clear that they will not tolerate anyone who treats them with nothing but total respect.\u201d\nWHAT\u2019S ON THEIR NIGHTSTAND? (Our contributors tell us about what they\u2019re currently reading) Dan Markey, adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and Senior Research Professor and Academic Director of the Global Policy Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies: \u201cI\u2019m reading The Silk Roads: A New History of the World, by Peter Frankopan, a sweeping history that will likely be by my bedside for a long time.  Frankopan re-frames our perspective not just from west to east, but inside out, by situating Central Asia at the heart of the story. \u201c SECURITY QUOTE OF THE WEEK: \u201cBut never underestimate the chances of a miscalculation. What about a situation where Kim believes we are beginning a military operation to overthrow him, even though we are not doing that? Miscalculations have occurred many times in history. This time it could end with a nuclear detonation over the United States. This is why we have to be extraordinarily careful with what we say and do vis-\u00e0-vis the North today.\u201d Begin lsgold7 specific forecast:\n it will fail due to THAAD or  cyber attacks\nkind of a trick question or am I am just a dumb lawyer\n0 chance I stress no way  they can hit US today but see\n alert http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/05/pentagon-eyes-iran-north-korea-military-connection.html DPRK artillery have Seoul  20m metro area and 50,00 US troops in range, on target and beyond any \"4cis fire control\"  they will continue  to be successful in  solid fuel mobile and sub launches\nthey look like Pak deterrent as they came from A Q Khan\nconsistent with number of India and Pak test 5-6\nstill do not have icbm nose cone done\nIRBM is a parabolic shot \nQuestion is can they hit Tokyo or Beijing or Pusan \nThe answer to that is yes if they get one on a pad and it rose 10 feet and exploded?\nTHAAD fully deployed as of today\n I  say 0 initiating coverage today.\nEvidence NO says Mike Morell https://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/expert-view/north-koreas-threat-us-homeland-correcting-misperception-1090?utm_source=Join+the+Community+Subscribers&utm_campaign=4802c06770-EM\n@dowser last one we nailed 3-2016 was a nose cone test\n see this year's military parade dummies 4-15-2017\njust out last 3 minutes http://38north.org/2017/05/missile050217/\nJ. Bermudez ( the real expert for me  in OSI)\nthe man\nall him begin quote \"The massive military parades in Pyongyang provide great opportunities to gain insight into North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile aspirations, but they are often used to disseminate propaganda and dissemble about its real aspirations and program direction. Rather than parades, infrastructure developments often provide the most accurate indicators and warnings of long-term program directions and capabilities. Some of the more notable examples that have not received the attention they deserved because of an excessive focus on the military parades include: The construction of two successive missile test stands from 2011-2014, which presaged the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and an experimental ballistic missile submarine;\nThe suspension, in 2013-2014, of a substantial modernization program[1] at the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, which foretold the concentration of limited resources into expanding and developing the Sohae Satellite Launching Station; and\nThe beginning of construction on a solid rocket engine test facility at Magunpo in early 2013, which anticipated the development of large solid-fuel rocket engines (i.e., for the Pukguksong-1 SLBM and Pukguksong-2 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM)), smaller air-to-air and air-to-ground class systems and potentially cruise missiles.\nMore recently, several infrastructure developments may provide new insights into future development in the North\u2019s missile programs. Among these are: Modernization of the vertical engine test stand facility at the Tae-sung Machine Factory: Commercial satellite imagery from February 20, 2016 and April 24, 2017 show that over the past year, a modernization program has begun at the Tae-sung Machine Factory\u2019s vertical engine test stand facility.[2] Included among the activities noted here are the placing of a guard position at the entrance, paving of the access road and parking area, construction of a large new paved work yard and the replacing of several support buildings with new structures. One of these new support structures is suggestive of a horizontal solid rocket engine test stand similar in size and layout to that seen at the Magunpo solid rocket engine test facility.[3] In March 2016, North Korea conducted a nose cone test at this site. That test along with the current modernization of this facility indicates its continuing role in more advanced ballistic missile design and development efforts. Should the new support building prove to be for solid rocket engine development and testing, it supports the analysis of an expanding effort in this field. It may also be related to the acquisition of the second submersible test stand barge and an expansion of SLBM developments to the West Sea area. Figure 1.

Recent commercial satellite imagery shows that during January-April 2017, the North has constructed two temporary launch positions on the south side of the Iha-ri facility.[5] Significantly, satellite imagery from March 14, 2017 shows what also appears to be a TEL with launch tube elevated. The image is taken at a high off-nadir angle, which makes accurate measurement challenging, however, the elevated height of the launch tube is approximately 11-12 meters with a diameter of approximately 3 meters. The overall length of the tube and TEL is approximately 11 meters. These dimensions match neither the Pukguksong-2 TEL with launch tube, nor the new trailer-mounted ICBM TEL\u2019s large launch tube.[6] Rather, taken as a whole, these developments suggest: an existing tracked Pukguksong-2 TEL with an, as yet unreported, missile system that has a larger diameter but is shorter than the systems displayed during the recent parade; an existing tracked Pukguksong-2 TEL with a missile training system; or an, as yet unreported, new TEL with a new missile system.

Moreover, Iha-ri is likely being used as a temporary training facility for launch crews. Additionally, the February 12 Pukguksong-2 test and April 15 parade indicate that the tracked TEL will likely form the basis for the first Pukguksong-2 missile brigade and that tracked or trailer TELs will likely form the basis for larger missile systems under development. The 2017 appearance of several indigenously designed and constructed tracked TELs\u2014based upon a common parent chassis rather than more efficient multi-axle wheeled TELs\u2014strongly suggests that international pressure on China to restrict sale of large, heavy-duty dual-use trucks to North Korea has had an effect upon the North\u2019s ballistic missile program.\"   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 [1] This modernization program included construction of a new launch pad, horizontal processing building, administration and launch control building and substantial road and housing improvements. [2] The Tae-sung Machine Factory is sometimes identified as the Chamjin-ri or Sagi-dong Missile Factory. This is North Korea\u2019s oldest ballistic missile production complex. [3] The dimensions of the Magunpo test stand are 16.25-meters by 8.25-meters, while the new structure at Tae-sung is approximately 16.25-meters by 6.25- meters. The structure at Tae-sung, however, does not presently have an exhaust trench. [4] Although the Iha-ri area has long been used for tank and armored fighting vehicle testing and driver training it wasn\u2019t until late-2014 that an actual facility and formal driving course was constructed. Although there is a 20-meter in diameter paved firing position on the west side of the facility suitable for training Pukguksong-2 TEL crews and launching the missile, North Korea elected to use the main driving training course for its February 2017 test launch of the system. [5] Each position consists of a square dirt pad (approximately 13-meters by 12.5-meters and approximately 13.75-meters by 13.5-meters) and a rectangular firing position approximately 17-meters by 4-meters). [6] The author would like to thank Nathan J. Hunt for sharing some of his preliminary dimensional data of the new canister missile systems displayed during the April 15, 2017 military parade.\"\nend quote\nLsgold7 concludes: ONE BAD HOMBRE! he needs a nosecone and  nuclear test not an icbm erectile dysfunction\nbut he is getting Iranian ballistics and he gives Iran  5 10-20k  deliverable nuke device on an IRBM\nthat is the \" axis of evil\"\npotential for EU and Russia and PRC  and Us or be balanced by just Iran and DPRK\nbig long term threat\nok sanctions  do not work\nthey do not work on Iran alone\nsanctions doe not work on DPRK alone\non   Iran and DPRK  trade NO IMPACT\nand both are beyond any balance of terror\nwake up DPRK and Iran are nuking up \nthe deadbeat club of WMD and  ballistics proliferators"], [20829, "2017-05-06T03:33:06Z", [0.65], ""], [31518, "2017-05-05T22:12:25Z", [0.96], ""], [368, "2017-05-05T18:40:18Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2017-05-05T18:35:46Z", [0.15], ""], [35284, "2017-05-05T15:20:48Z", [0.32], "They still working on it but regarding the latest attempts they need more time to achieve it "], [4634, "2017-05-05T13:58:20Z", [0.25], ""], [35270, "2017-05-04T22:27:06Z", [0.3], "Testing the part commonly used to carry nukes would be a step too far, everything else could be considered a bluff but this would be considered very serious."], [30330, "2017-05-04T20:19:21Z", [0.55], "As missile tests have less of a deterrent effect, the young leader may require a greater show of force to engender unity in the nation.

The various stages of component design, development, testing and launching (needs highly compotent scientists, fissile material and other factors) can occur within one or several cycles depending on the stage of technological development.

With prior production storage of fissile material, at this point, we know that has a capability of the use of 14 - 48 nuclear missiles.

A previous Beyond Parallel study also found that North Korean kinetic provocations, including missile and nuclear tests, have clustered increasingly closer to U.S. elections.\nUnder Kim Jong-un, the average window for a North Korean provocation bracketed around all ROK elections is 6.5 days (about 1 week). The average for presidential elections is 15 days or about two weeks.\nThis represents a significant change from previous periods: Under the leadership of both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il the window was an average of about 10 and 11 weeks respectively.\nThere has been a transformation in the types of kinetic provocations that North Korea has carried out over the last 20 years. The provocations are now overwhelmingly comprised of missile and nuclear tests rather than other types of conventional kinetic military actions.\nThis pattern suggests a provocation as early as two weeks before the South Korean elections on May 9th.
