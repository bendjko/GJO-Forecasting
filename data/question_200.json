Any freedom given to any group (e.g. women allowed to drive) or or taken away (e.g. restrictions on what the religious police can do) will destabilize Saudi society because the conservatives will not be happy. In Saudi Arabia, as in medieval Europe everyone \"belongs\" to a \"sponsor\", that is someone who gives them access to power and or protects them from power, if princes who are near the top of the pyramid are removed, their \"people\" have no one to look after them. In a hierarchical society like Saudi Arabia that is very upsetting because new hierarchies are not easily formed. \nIn any autocracy the most dangerous time is when reform is attempted because those who benefit from the status quo will resent losing privileges while those who should benefit from change have their hopes raised, but are disappointed when the befits seem not to the coming fast enough. \nSo the listing of Saudi Aramco could be seen not as an opportunity to  invest in a stable flow of oil, but a risky investment in an unstable country, in an unstable commodity that it past its peak.

Yet, there may be another factor that could bring down oil prices as soon as next year\u2026 China. China has been building a strategic crude oil reserve for the last decade, but the size of that reserve remains undisclosed, with analysts making estimates based on China-bound cargoes and satellite imaging. Last year, a Silicone Valley tech company, Orbital Insight, suggested that China may have stored as much as 600 million barrels of crude by May. This was the highest reserve estimate at the time. Since then, the reserve has in all likelihood grown, possibly exceeding the U.S. SPR, which stood at 678.9 million barrels as of August 18th this year. This year, Chinese crude imports have run at record-breaking rates, with the average daily on par with what the U.S. imports, at about 8 million barrels, the Financial Times notes in an analysis. A lot of these, however, are going into storage tanks, analysts believe, and they warn that soon the tanks may fill up, wreaking havoc on prices and--more notably--on OPEC. The cartel, Russia and 11 other producers agreed last year to remove 1.8 million bpd from global oil supply in an attempt to raise prices above US$50, with hopes for at least $60. This May, they agreed to extend the cuts to March 2018. Nevertheless, prices have remained largely stable around the $50 mark because of rising U.S. output, which last week jumped above 9.5 million bpd, according to the EIA (para 1-5). Slav, I. (2017).

U.S. crude futures settled down 97 cents, or 1.96%, at $48.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement level since July 25. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 80 cents, or 1.52%, to $51.90 a barrel after hitting an 11-week high on London\u2019s ICE Futures exchange.

Oil traded in a wide range Thursday\u2014the U.S. benchmark rose as high as $50.22 during the day, but sold off sharply in the final minutes of trading.

Perhaps the most visible economic issue is the debt payments that fall due this year. Venezuela has $5 billion in debt maturing before the year is out \u2013 both in sovereign bonds and in debt payments by state-owned oil company PDVSA (para. 4).\nThat is an alarming figure given that the government has an estimated $3 billion in cash reserves, according to S&P Global Ratings, a paltry sum that means a default in the next few months is more likely than not.

The brimming oil inventories that have pressured prices for three years had started to decline in recent weeks as U.S. demand rose and OPEC production was reduced. But some analysts say this decline in stockpiles could reverse later in the year as U.S. crude production continues to grow. A poll of 15 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal at the end of July, predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, will average $53 a barrel this year, down $2 from the June survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $51 a barrel this year, down a dollar from the previous survey. Banks in the survey have also downgraded their expectations for next year, predicting Brent crude will average $55 a barrel, down $2 from the June poll. The banks expect WTI to average $53 a barrel in 2018, also down $2 (para 1-4). However, stock levels around the world continue to be above historical averages, as the world struggles to drain the crude glut that has pressured prices since 2014. That\u2019s in part due to the increasing flow of oil from U.S. fields (para 11). U.S. oil production last week rose by 20,000 barrels a day, the EIA data showed. Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last year clinched a deal to limit its output, has seen some of its members produce above the agreed-upon levels as they make up for budget shortfalls (para. 11-12).

Why? Its members are addicted to oil. Eight months after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a plan for its 14 members and 10 allied countries to withhold almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil every day to boost prices, seven of the 11 OPEC members that pledged to cut appear to be producing more oil than promised. Crude prices have actually fallen, by 7.6% to $52.52 a barrel, since the beginning of the year\u2014half what the cartel called a fair price just three years ago and a level that some say is here for the long term. Previously, low production costs meant OPEC members profited even when oil prices fell. These days, members have ramped up government spending to keep populations happy and cover military expenses, and don\u2019t have a cushion to let oil revenues slip. Their strained budgets can be covered only through increasingly high prices per barrel, and if prices are low they need to produce more (para 1-5). The output has stolen market share from the cartel\u2019s members and pushed prices lower. OPEC\u2019s share of the global oil market has shrunk to 40% today from 55% in the early 1970s, when its embargo on sales to the West quadrupled oil prices in six months (para 13). The dynamic working against OPEC is that, collectively, its members need the highest oil prices of any industry player\u2014more than companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC and most U.S. shale producers, according to Goldman Sachs . For decades, OPEC was the low-cost producer of oil. During the boom years of 2011 through 2014, OPEC members, which largely fund national spending with oil revenue, could balance their budgets with oil prices $10 to $40 a barrel less than most oil companies needed to fund their spending and pay dividends. Today, OPEC needs $10 to $20 a barrel more than Big Oil and U.S. exploration and production outfits, the investment bank said in a report to clients (para. 13- 15).

Last year, the U.S. became the world's top net exporter of fuel, an outgrowth of booming domestic production since the shale oil revolution started in 2010. That's a fundamental shift from the traditional U.S. role in global markets as a top importer and consumer. Net exports are on track to hit another record in 2017, making foreign fuel markets increasingly important for the future growth prospects and profit margins of U.S. refiners. Shale oil producers have provided refiners with abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies, giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel. The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum products to foreign markets. That compares to net fuel imports of 2.3 million just a decade ago, according to U.S. government data (para 1-5). Latin American Buyers U.S. refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where refineries have been running below capacity. U.S. exports have also made inroads into Brazil's market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel (para. 16). In recession-scarred Venezuela, the country's largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity, a level that has required state-run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand (para. 19). Between them, Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year - mostly from the United States - an amount suggesting that U.S. exports will grow again this year over last year's record levels (para. 19-20).

The world\u2019s largest drillers failed to take advantage of high prices during the boom years before 2014 to repay debt, according to the report published on Tuesday. Instead they embarked on costly investments in new projects and dividends, leaving them unprepared for the painful downturn that ensued. Now, a weak recovery in oil prices is making it harder to reduce the debt accumulated in recent years. Exxon last year lost the platinum credit rating it held since the Great Depression, and all of its largest rivals, including Total SA, BP Plc, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc also faced similar reductions. Further downgrades could become more likely later this year or in 2018 if oil prices remain below $50 a barrel, the report said (para. 1-3). Get-Out-of-Jail \"The modest improvement in oil prices this year reflects the support from the OPEC and Russian agreement to constrain production,\" Simon Redmond, director of corporate ratings for commodities at S&P, wrote in the report. \"But it hardly offers a get-out-of-jail-free card for ratings\" (para. 6). S&P warned Exxon seven weeks ago that the explorer\u2019s balance sheet was under strain, degrading the oil producer\u2019s outlook to negative. The rating company said it worried Exxon may \u201cprioritize capital spending, acquisitions or shareholder returns over debt reduction.\u201d Total, Exxon, and Chevron face the greatest danger of a ratings cut, given their elevated debt loads and lackluster efforts to curtail investments and dividend payouts. An exception to the trend is Shell, the only company among the five to receive a positive outlook from S&P. Shell outperformed its peers last year, putting it in a better position than its rivals to cut costs as prices remain low. An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production is proving unable so far to significantly raise prices and diminish a global supply glut. Oil companies may choose to prioritize debt reduction by selling off assets and winding down long-term investments, Harvey said.

It's one hour that's worth it.  Skip to 46:04 if you can't spare the attention.   So by 2020, the oil market may look radically different.  Expensive oil such as shale oil, oil sands, and deepwater will become stranded in a market where the equilibrium price of a barrel of oil drops to $25.  Conventional oil such as what we have with the Saudi Kingdom will survive but they'll have to adjust to the new market reality.  The question is whether the unconventional producers will seek to extract as much oil as possible now before the technological disruption caused by the development of the solar and energy storage markets forces them out for good.

Crude ended the quarter 9% lower, and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market. It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output, but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices. For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter. At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well (para. 1-6). Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts (para. 13). Citigroup is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm\u2019s analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake. Citi analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday. \u201cThe fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,\u201d the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.

It is difficult to be sure how secure the position of the new Crown Prince is. It is known he likes to take decisive actions, but it is not clear if what he does is always wise. The Saudi society is very conservative and previous rulers (the Crown Price is the de facto ruler today) have been very careful not to make changes at a faster pace than society is ready to accept. The Saudi system (in common with many dictatorships) is based on having several different power bases below the King, none of which is quite powerful enough to seize control. These include religious and legal powers, as well as a number of well armed military and para-military forces that report to and are loyal to different ministers (who are also Princes and relatives of the King). Beside the forces of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of the National Guard has what is effect a second and counterbalancing army, the Ministry of the Interior has another group of armed land and sea forces. Any changes in Saudi Arabia have to take into account the rights and privileges of each of these groups that in many ways act as states within the state. Each group is headed by people who have traditional two way loyalties to the King and rights over aspects of the running of the state. Any changes to the status quo are bound to unsettle this balance of power. It is well known that reforming authoritarian regimes creates great risks to stability - expectations often jump ahead of delivery for those wanting changes, and those fearing the changes will try and stop them.\nI am not trying to forecast what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the next few years , but an impetuous, inexperienced new de facto ruler could destabilize the country. This could be made worse by the end of oil money that has held the country together since the 1970s (before that the oil money was much lower). Although it seems that it is not always politic to acknowledge the fact, it is Saudi Arabia that has been where Al Queda and ISIS got a lot of its support, upset the fragile balance and it could turn into another failed Arab state.

They shrank from a record high of $737 billion (578.36 billion pounds) in August 2014 to $529 billion at the end of 2016 as the government liquidated some assets to cover the huge budget deficit caused by the fall in oil prices. This year, an austerity drive and a partial rebound in oil prices have helped Riyadh make progress in cutting the deficit -- which narrowed 71 percent from a year ago to 26 billion riyals ($6.9 billion) in the first quarter. But net foreign assets have continued to shrink at about the same rate, by $36 billion in the first four months of 2017 -- a mystery to economists and diplomats monitoring Saudi Arabia, and a potential blow to markets' confidence in Riyadh. \"This suggests that there remains a significant deficit in the balance of payments of Saudi Arabia, which is not due to declining oil export revenues,\" said Khatija Haque, head of regional research at Emirates NBD, Dubai's biggest bank (para. 1-5). \"Capital flight has diminished as an issue. Outflows in 2016 were pretty small beer compared with 2015, when there were significant outflows,\" said an economist at a Saudi bank (para 10). An international banker in touch with Saudi authorities said much of the decline in foreign assets appeared due to the transfer of money to state funds investing abroad -- particularly the main sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Riyadh plans to invest big amounts overseas to win access to technology and boost returns on its capital. The PIF has said it will invest up to $45 billion over five years in a technology fund created by Japan's Softbank (9984.T), and $20 billion in an infrastructure fund planned by U.S. firm Blackstone (para. 10-13). OIL A fresh slump in oil prices also looks likely to pressure foreign assets. Brent oil LCOc1 averaged $54.57 in the first quarter of this year; it has since plunged to around $46, just $1 above its average price last year (para. 15). This, combined with a minor relaxation of austerity in recent weeks to head off a recession, may mean Riyadh's budget deficit for all of 2017 comes close to its original projection of 198 billion riyals ($52.79 billion), or possibly a little higher. That would be an improvement from last year's 297 billion riyals, but combined with transfers to the PIF, it would force further liquidation of the central bank's foreign assets. \"Going forward, the decline is likely to continue given the projected budget deficit for the whole year, which would probably require withdrawals from foreign reserves to finance it,\" said Said al-Sheikh, group chief economist at National Commercial Bank, the largest Saudi bank (para. 15-18).

It shows little understanding of where it is, how it got there or where it's going. While it still manages to collect new members here and there, its core group looks more fragile than at any point in nearly 30 years. The historic output agreements, put together so painstakingly last year, are failing. Nearly 12 months of shuttle diplomacy culminated in two deals that would see 22 countries cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels a day. Implementation has been better than for any previous output cut, with compliance put at 106 percent in May. A resounding success? Hardly. We're now in the final month of those deals and oil prices are lower than when they were agreed. Not only have producers sacrificed volume, but they earn less for each barrel they do produce. Nothing Gained\nCrude has fallen back below levels last seen before OPEC's November output deal The recent extension of the deals just leaves output restraint in place for another nine months, the best response OPEC could muster. Deeper cuts were barely mentioned. Assertions to do \"whatever it takes\" ring hollow. Indeed, there's no appetite for the big cuts that would demand real sacrifices in countries such as Russia, where normal seasonal factors helped it lower production in the first half of the year. Just sticking to current output levels could be difficult for the rest of 2017: early maintenance work has helped several OPEC members meet their targets but that can't continue. Then there's the problem of recovering output from Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the cuts. The malaise runs much deeper, though. Beneath a veneer of unity, rifts are developing among core Middle East members. The Saudi-led confrontation with Qatar could create the most serious split since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. As I wrote last week, Iraq might be in Mohammed bin Salman's sights next, as Iran's influence there grows and Baghdad lags the rest in implementing output cuts. As if the internal failings weren't enough, OPEC seems to have lost touch with reality. Ministers say higher prices are needed to pay for investment in future production capacity, issuing dire warnings of a future supply crunch. They said the same thing to justify prices soaring above $100 a barrel in 2008. It wasn't true then, and it may not be true now. The oil industry has responded to the price slump by slashing costs. Projects that needed $100 crude to break even have magically been redesigned to be profitable at half that level. OPEC has completely misjudged the North American shale industry and seems not to understand how it is still evolving rapidly. It's a little like trying to explain the internet to my 85-year-old mother, or my 12-year-old daughter trying to explain social media to me. As consultant Morten Frisch tells me, drilling horizontal sidetracks from abandoned wells in the Permian Basin is yielding a 91 percent internal rate of return on a $7 million investment and delivering 1,500 barrels a day of crude. He predicts large production increases from vertical wells in previously produced areas in the Permian (para. 1-9). Lee, J. (2017). OPEC Looks Totally Bewildered by the Oil Market. Bloomberg.

Analysts said oil prices extended gains as investors covered short positions, but there was little fundamental news supporting prices. \"It is just the fact that the oil market stopped falling... I suspect short covering,\" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. \"And a slight support from a weak U.S. dollar.\" The U.S. dollar index stayed low on Monday against a basket of currencies amid fading expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year. A weaker dollar also makes oil cheaper for countries using other currencies. \"Commodities stabilized after a turbulent week where most sectors suffered large falls,\" ANZ bank said in a note. \"A slightly weaker U.S. dollar also helped improve investor appetite.\" Although oil prices have bounced back from 10-month lows, they are still down about 13 percent since late May, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers agreed to extend a deal to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next March. But crude supplies in the United States, which is not part of the OPEC-led deal, have been dampening the impact of curbs.

Mohammed bin Salman, elevated to crown prince of Saudi Arabia this week, needs oil prices to rise from current levels of $45 a barrel to carry out plans to kick-start the kingdom\u2019s economy, largely through a partial public listing of its state oil company, known as Saudi Aramco. The Saudis are targeting $60 a barrel to help the initial public offering generate tens of billions of dollars, which would be plowed into developing new technology and industrial sectors in Saudi Arabia. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have held informal talks in recent days about how to halt a nearly month-long skid in oil prices, which have fallen more than 16% since late May. OPEC, along with big producers like Russia that aren\u2019t members of the 14-nation cartel, is already withholding almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil supply, but some OPEC members say more needs to be done to bring production in line with demand. Prince Mohammed is known for taking aggressive action on several fronts, prosecuting a war in Yemen, leading the diplomatic freeze against Qatar, and green-lighting Saudi participation in OPEC\u2019s production cuts. But the Saudis have less leverage over other OPEC members because of the Aramco IPO, said Jim Krane, a fellow who studies Middle East energy and geopolitical issues at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute. Other OPEC members are unlikely to slash production further unless they see Saudi Arabia taking on a large share of the burden, because any new cuts would be seen as a push to support the Aramco IPO (para. 1-5). Saudi Arabia has time to wait for oil prices to rise, with the IPO not scheduled until 2018. Publicly, Saudi Arabia, its allies and OPEC are preaching patience (para. 10). On Thursday, OPEC issued a news release touting its members compliance with their pledges to cut production. \u201cThe oil market is moving in the right direction,\u201d the news release said. Mr. Falih told an Arabic newspaper in London that Libyan and Nigerian production wouldn\u2019t stop OPEC\u2019s efforts to drain down the global oil oversupply by the end of 2017. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 oil minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, said OPEC wasn\u2019t planning any new action soon Privately, OPEC members\u2019 worries are centered on two members who were exempted from the obligation to cut output: Libya and Nigeria. Both had their oil industries disrupted by civil strife, but their production has come roaring back in recent months.

The global benchmark closed more than 20 percent below the year\u2019s peak settlement, meeting the common definition of a bear market. The same happened with West Texas Intermediate on Tuesday. \"There\u2019s a sea of negativity,\" said Maxwell Gold, director of investment strategy at ETF Securities LLC. \"This is much more a story of sentiment weighing on the markets.\" Oil has returned to levels last seen before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia decided in November to cut production to drain a global glut.

WTI fell 98 cents to close at $42.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after dipping to the lowest since August.

Their confidence held up for the first months of 2017, when oil was comfortably ensconced in a range between $50 a barrel and $55.

But what if they\u2019re wrong? There\u2019s a host of reasons to think they might be. Here\u2019s what happens when you test their central assumptions. The International Energy Agency sees oil demand rising more than 10 percent, to 103.5 million barrels a day by 2040, while companies predict even faster growth. But forecasters don\u2019t always anticipate seismic shifts in technology and policy that could slow demand growth, or even eliminate it altogether in some parts of the economy. Even small changes could add up. Advances in vehicle efficiency, a rise in electric cars, tighter emissions standards and shifts to other fuel sources would result in oil demand much lower than the industry is banking on. \u201cWe cannot even begin to comprehend the transformation in the mobility arena that is coming at us,\u201d Jules Kortenhorst, chief executive officer of the Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Boulder, Colorado, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question if it will come, it\u2019s only a question of what the timing of the arrival will be.\u201d Technological Change About 60 percent of oil is used in transportation, which is also where the biggest technological changes are emerging. All over the world, governments concerned about climate change or air pollution are pushing tighter fuel-efficiency standards, or creating low-emission zones for cars and even ships. The exposure of cheating on diesel-emissions test by Volkswagen AG, and similar accusations against other automakers has added to the pressure on regulators to toughen standards. The proliferation of big data analysis is set to dramatically curb fuel waste, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute. Aircraft being produced today by companies like General Electric Co. can already detect small changes in engine performance, meaning engineers can be sent out to fix any issues and keep them operating at peak efficiency. Smarter navigation technologies allow truck drivers to reduce the distances they travel, while improvements to aerodynamics will enable vehicles to travel farther on less fuel.

The truth is, OPEC has little choice but to extend the cuts initially approved in November to ease a global glut. It bet U.S. shale drillers would be too weak to step in and fill the void.

Other big oil-pumping nations meanwhile are weary, of lower prices, currently just above $50 a barrel, and determined to take about 2% of global supplies off the market in an effort to shrink bloated oil inventory levels and put a floor under crude prices.

Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield. The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers. Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough. Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut. Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency. The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts. In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely. On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018. That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia. The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih - in response to surging U.S. output. After OPEC's decision in November, Al-Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand. Then in March, Al-Falih told a Houston energy conference that the \"green shoots\" in U.S. shale might be \"growing too fast\" - and warned there would be no \"free rides\" for U.S. producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts. But by last week, Al-Falih vowed OPEC would do \"whatever it takes\" to control oversupply (para. 1-14). Scheyder, E. (2017). In America's largest oilfield, whir of activity confounds OPEC. Reuters.

Brent crude was down 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, from the last close at $51.45 per barrel at 0647 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $48.39, down 27 cents, or 0.6 percent. U.S. crude inventories rose by 882,000 barrels in the week ending May 12 to 523.4 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday. Brent reached $52.63 a barrel on Monday and WTI rose as high as $49.66 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on the need for a, 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) crude supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers to be extended until the end of March 2018. Official U.S. storage data will be released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday. \"The vulnerability of OPEC's ... rhetoric was starkly revealed ... as the U.S. API crude inventories showed an unexpected increase,\" said Jeffrey Halley of futures brokerage OANDA. There are also rising amounts of tankers storing oil offshore China as facilities on land are full. The extension of the supply cuts, which started in January and were supposed to end in June, is seen as necessary by some as they have not so far significantly tightened the market or propped up prices. The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that commercial oil inventories in industrialized countries rose by 24.1 million barrels in the first quarter of 2016, despite the cuts. \"The agreement by OPEC to extend cuts into 2018 is critical,\" said AB Bernstein in a note. Adding to ongoing oversupply concerns, North Sea oil production, generally seen in terminal decline, is expected to jump by a net 400,000 bpd, a fifth of total output, in the next two years as producers improve efficiency. This adds to a 10 percent jump in U.S. production since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd, not far off top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia (para. 1-13). Gloystein, H. (2017).

Flush with cash from a short-lived OPEC-led crude rally, North American drillers plan to lift their 2017 outlays by 32 percent to $84 billion, compared with just 3 percent for international projects, according to analysts at Barclays Plc. Much of the increase in spending is flowing into the Permian Basin, a sprawling, mile-thick accumulation of crude beneath Texas and New Mexico, where producers have been reaping double-digit returns even with oil commanding less than half what it did in 2014. That\u2019s bad news for OPEC and its partners in a global campaign to crimp supplies and elevate prices. Wood Mackenzie Ltd. estimates that new spending will add 800,000 barrels of North American crude this year, equivalent to 44 percent of the reductions announced by the Saudi- and Russia-led group. \u201cThe specter of American supply is real,\u201d Roy Martin, a Wood Mackenzie research analyst in Houston, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe level of capital budget increases really surprised us.\u201d Drilling budgets around the world collapsed in 2016 as the worst crude market collapse in a generation erased cash flows, forcing explorers to cancel expansion projects, cut jobs and sell oil and natural gas fields to raise cash. The pain also swept across the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which in November relented by agreeing with several non-OPEC nations to curb output by 1.8 million barrels a day. Oil prices that initially popped above $55 in the weeks after the cut was announced have since dipped to around $46, reflecting pessimism that the OPEC-led deal can withstand the onslaught of U.S. shale.\nSo far, independent American explorers such as EOG Resources Inc. and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. are holding fast to their ambitious growth plans. Some recently finished wells in the Permian region yielded 70 percent returns at first-quarter prices, EOG Chief Executive Officer Bill Thomas told investors and analysts during a conference call on Tuesday. EOG, the second-largest U.S. explorer that doesn\u2019t own refineries, plans to boost spending by 44 percent this year to between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion. Pioneer is eyeing a 33 percent increase to $2.8 billion. The sub-group that includes North American shale drillers like EOG and Pioneer is collectively targeting $53 billion in spending this year, up from $35 billion in 2016, according to the Barclays analysts led by J. David Anderson. U.S. oil production is already swelling, even though output from the new wells being drilled won\u2019t materialize above ground for months. The Energy Department\u2019s statistics arm raised its full-year 2017 supply estimate to 9.31 million barrels a day on Tuesday, a 1 percent increase from the April forecast (para. 1-11). Carroll, J.

Oil has given up all its gains since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers signed a deal late last year to limit supply for six months from January. Prices have been hit by surging output in the U.S., which is not part of the agreement.

The International Energy Agency has trimmed its forecasts for global oil demand growth this year by about 100,000 barrels a day to 1.3 million a day as a result of weaker consumption in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries and an abrupt slowdown in economic activity in India and Russia, according to a report last month. The Paris-based IEA cut its estimate for India\u2019s 2017 oil-demand growth by 11 percent. There\u2019s also concern that consumption may slow in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest oil user. Independent refiners, which account for about a third of the nation\u2019s capacity, have received lower crude import quotas compared with a year earlier, prompting speculation their purchases could slow. \u201cThe oil market is looking for growth but there\u2019s no growth,\u201d Vitol\u2019s Kho said, adding that the refiners may only get approval for the same volume of imports as last year. And while U.S. gasoline consumption is expected to hit its seasonal summer peak soon, demand growth \u201cis not there yet,\u201d he said.\nThe world\u2019s biggest crude exporter is nevertheless bullish. Saudi Arabia expects 2017 global consumption to grow at a rate close to that of 2016, Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said on Monday. \u201cWe look for China\u2019s oil demand growth to match last year\u2019s, on the back of a robust transport sector, while India\u2019s anticipated annual economic growth of more than seven percent will continue to drive healthy growth,\u201d he said in Kuala Lumpur. While some fear a slowdown in Chinese oil demand, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. doesn\u2019t see any cause for concern. Growth in the nation\u2019s car fleet will support gasoline demand, with increasing truck sales and air travel also helping fuel consumption, it said in a report dated May 9 (para. 1-10).

Doubts that the OPEC-led supply cut of the past few months are deep enough to draw down bloated storage levels around the world are also weighing on prices.

State-owned Saudi Aramco will reduce oil supplies to Asian customers by about 7 million barrels in June, a source told Reuters, as part of OPEC's agreement to reduce production and as it trims exports to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer. Seven million barrels is roughly two days of oil imports into Japan, the world's fourth biggest importer. Aramco had previously been maintaining supplies to its important Asian customers (para. 1-3). It also fell 1.2 percent the previous session, and the closing price for both contracts on Tuesday was the second lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut production during the first half of 2017 (para. 6). While prices surged immediately after the agreement, in recent weeks they have come under sustained pressure as U.S. production has ramped up.

Net foreign assets dropped to 645.2 million dinars ($1.7 billion), from 725.9 million dinars in January, according to central bank data released on Sunday. Overall, they\u2019re down 71 percent from a peak of 2.24 billion dinars in November 2014. Bahrain, a close Saudi ally and home to the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet, has been more vulnerable to slumping oil prices and regional political instability than richer Gulf Cooperation Council states. With authorities expected to maintain the dollar peg, Bahrain \u201cwill likely either tap international markets or receive support from other GCC governments,\u201d said Carla Slim, a Dubai-based economist at Standard Chartered. Reserves will likely \u201cremain under pressure this year,\u201d she said. The latest data come nearly a month after the International Monetary Fund warned that Bahrain needs to make significant spending cuts to restore stability to its budget and improve investor confidence. Credit Risk Bahraini assets, however, have weathered the pressure of the country\u2019s financial troubles, largely because investors expect Saudi Arabia to extend aid if needed. The cost of insuring Bahrain\u2019s debt, measured by credit default swaps, dropped for seven straight months through April, the longest streak since 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The kingdom raised $600 million from international bond markets in February. \u201cThere is little doubt that Saudi stands ready to provide support to Bahrain,\u201d said Hasnain Malik, head of Global Equities Research at Exotix. Forcing Bahrain to abandon its peg would raise questions over those in Saudi Arabia and Oman, he said. Bahraini authorities increased spending in response to the global recession in 2009 and civil unrest two years later as sectarian tensions escalated in the Gulf island nation. When oil prices tumbled, the budget deficit soared, reaching almost 18 percent of gross domestic product last year. The oil price the government needs to balance its budget remains over $100 a barrel, the highest in the GCC, according to IMF estimates (para. 1-9). Carey, G. & Gokoluk, S. (2017).

The kingdom raised pricing to all other regions. State-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, lowered its official pricing for Arab Light crude to Asia by 40 cents to an 85 cent discount to the regional benchmark, it said in an emailed statement, in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five refiners and traders in the region. Saudi Arabia has ceded market share to OPEC rivals Iran and Iraq by making deeper cuts in output than it promised under the group\u2019s agreement to curb production. Analysts including Christof Ruehl of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Edward Bell at Dubai lender Emirates NBD PJSC say Iran has gained ground since the easing of sanctions on its oil industry last year, and the OPEC deal permits it to pump more. Even as Aramco trims output, it\u2019s been lowering pricing to Asia to defend sales, Bell said. By contrast, Aramco raised the pricing on all grades of oil for U.S. sales for the second consecutive month. It also raised pricing for Europe and the Mediterranean, reversing cuts made there last month. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other suppliers agreed to pare production by 1.8 million barrels a day during the first half of this year. They\u2019re seeking to end a crude glut that slashed prices to less than half of their 2014 high, when Brent crude sold at $115 a barrel. Oil jumped 52 percent last year for the first annual gain after three consecutive declines. There\u2019s a consensus that the cuts will be extended into the second half, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said last week. OPEC plans to decide at the end of May whether to extend its production limits. Middle Eastern producers compete with cargoes from Latin America, North Africa and Russia for buyers in Asia, its largest market.

At least, that was the logic back in November 2014.But things haven't gone according to plan. OPEC's four-month experiment with production curbs has failed. More worryingly, the strength of shale's rebound suggests that OPEC faces a long-term struggle against this new source of supply in an industry where technological advances are the norm and today's niche play becomes the next decade's global standard. Even when the group restored production curbs last year, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he didn\u2019t expect a big supply response from American shale producers in 2017.

Much of that increase has come from shale formations.

Gasoline stockpiles climbed 1.54 million barrels last week, surprising analysts surveyed by Bloomberg who projected the Energy Information Administration data would show a 2-million-barrel decrease. Crude inventories fell 1.03 million barrels to 532.3 million, the agency reported Wednesday. Crude production rose to the highest since August 2015. Price drops accelerated as the dollar strengthened against its peers, curbing the appeal of commodities. Oil had rallied above $53 a barrel after some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries voiced support for prolonging cuts past June, but rising U.S. output is undermining the effort to trim a global glut.

Saudi officials explored investment opportunities with firms including BP (BP. L) and Chevron (CVX.N) to help develop its gas reserves, the world's sixth largest, at a time of booming energy demand at home, four industry sources told Reuters. Aramco has also looked into investing in gas ventures abroad, including with Italy's Eni (ENI.MI), the sources said. The development revives memories of talks between Aramco and global majors at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, known as the Saudi gas initiative. Most of those talks collapsed as the parties disagreed over returns on investment. This time, Aramco is gearing up for a share listing next year, aiming to get a valuation of up to $2 trillion in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) (para. 1-5).

Aramco has never issued a financial report.  \"Any evaluation of the Saudi giant includes hefty assumptions and lacks specific figures, given the Kingdom\u2019s reluctance to share its oil secrets with the world, being a swing producer and leader of OPEC, which has been fixing\u2014or trying to fix\u2014the global price of oil.\"  \n-industry insiders are saying it is set for 2018 (not this year)\n-\" . . . .political considerations will have a big say in the Saudi plans for Aramco\u2019s IPO, and will weigh on global investors\u2019 appetite to buy into the company when part of it goes public.  . . . investors could still be wary to put their money into a company that is so politically entangled, putting more downward pressure on the company\u2019s total value.

The two-year decline in crude prices has left it with huge budget deficits: $98 billion last year and a projected $87 billion in 2016. This has forced the kingdom to tap into its cash reserves, which have declined from $732 billion at the end of 2014 to $562 billion last month. Last year, the International Monetary Fund predicted that if Saudi Arabia continued its current fiscal path, it could burn through its entire foreign exchange reserves by 2020.\nThis has shocked the kingdom into austerity. Government payrolls have been slashed and subsidies removed. Over the last few months, capital expenditures have been cut by more than 70 percent. In 2013, government debt to gross domestic product ratio stood at 2.2 percent, per Moody\u2019s Corp. By 2017, it is forecast to be 22 percent; by 2020, 30 percent. \nThe Saudis wanted to deal a fatal blow to U.S. shale production, which largely relies on expensive hydraulic fracking to thrive. The Saudi calculus at the time was if it flooded the market with enough excess crude, the price would drop precipitously, thus rendering North American shale production cost prohibitive. \nOpening the tap hurt Saudi Arabia's economy far more than it had anticipated.\nFurthermore, since Iran came to a nuclear deal with the West it has not only recaptured its market share, but is also producing more crude than at any point over the past five years. In a reversal of fortune, it\u2019s now the Saudis who are trying to persuade the Iranians to agree to a production cut when OPEC meets Nov. 30, and it\u2019s the Iranians (and Iraqis) who are balking.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-11-02/saudi-arabia-s-bond-success-hides-its-financial-peril\n_________________________\nCOMMENTS:  interesting articles.

Saudi Arabia is facing financial problems - these problems may reduce somewhat as oil price has crossed $50/barrel and has stayed there for some months now. This reduces the pressure on the kingdom to diversify. \n2. There is a prospect that oil prices could go up further in 2017 - as investment in upstream has reduced during 2015 (25%) & 2016 (24%) and may fall during 2017 as well - while oil demand has risen by  1.8 million bpd and 1.2 million bpd in 2015 & 2016 and is expected to go up another 1.2 million bpd in 2017 (IEA). This should reduce the pressure on monarchy to list Aramco. \n3. For a listing, Aramco will have to do roadshows in major financial centres in US and Europe where they will have to speak to investors and the media. The monarchy can face serious embarrassment at the hands of pro-democracy activists/journalists in such a setting - where they can be asked questions about freedom of religion in KSA, status of women, support to ISIS or the war in Yemen. Will the monarchy/country want to provide a forum where it can be questioned? Without some radical reforms which allows the kingdom to show a reformist face to the world, scrutiny by media can result in a major loss of face. \n4. Aramco will also need to make public a lot of financial and operational information - including information about the state of their oil fields - which they have so far hidden. These are difficult issues to resolve and will take time. It also needs to be decided on what information can/cannot be made public. \n5. Media reports indicate that the divestment in Aramco and the diversification of Saudi economy away from oil are initiatives of the Deputy Crown Prince, who is also in charge of the war in Yemen. This intervention has been going on since March 2015 (21 months now) - and seems likely to stretch. This reduces the credibility of the Deputy Crown Prince to carry out radical steps.  I would like to re-look this forecast in the following circumstances:\n1. If there is a material change in the price of oil (below $40/barrel or above $60/barrel for at least 3 months). Higher price of oil will reduce the need for floating Aramco. Opposite if the price of oil falls. \n2. If KSA is able to bring the intervention in Yemen to a successful close. This may increase the bandwidth available with the regime. \n3. If Aramco does a private placement of shares to some investors. That will be a strong signal to an IPO.\n4. If the Saudi regime carries out some reforms on status of women and religious minorities which it can showcase to the world.

So now we know that oil price fluctuations will significantly inform ARAMCO on their IPO date.  Now if oil prices go up a lot, we could have an earlier IPO date.  But I would point out that if oil prices go down overall, it would reasonable to expect a later date.   So I will keep an eye on oil prices.  If the prices just go nuts, there is a decent chance of an earlier IPO.   But there are other logistical factors.  It is necessary for ARAMCO to come with a lot of public information, in particular financial statements, that may even have to be in conformance with IFRS standards.  As this was not done in the past, it is a lot of work to do now.  And apparently ARAMCO is spending a lot of money dressing up its operations as well.  So there is a lot to do if ARAMCO is going to be suitably impressive when it opens up its doors.  Not easy for a MASSIVE company that has been as private as it gets.

(Reuters)\n-------------------------\nCOMMENT:  Besides the somewhat reassuring news above, Saudi Arabia, is projected to grow at a modest 1.2 percent this year in the face of fiscal consolidation, before picking up to 2 percent growth next year. Last year the growth to GDP was (approx) 4.0%; Saudi Arabia has experienced a sharp decline in GDP growth, as well as lower liquidity and credit growth.  Last year, oil accounted for about three-quarters of the Kingdom\u2019s total export revenues and around 90% of government revenue.  The KSA real national wealth has declined. Oil revenues, as is the case elsewhere in the region, were not efficiently transformed into human capital, infrastructure, and the innovative capacity needed to generate productivity growth and diversify economic activity. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s National Transformation Program (NTP), announced last June, suggests that Saudi Arabia will take the opposite approach, subjecting the economy to a kind of shock therapy. All of this will need to be achieved efficiently, in order to facilitate the government\u2019s other key goal: a balanced budget by 2020.

U.S. crude for October delivery fell $1.39, or 3%, to $44.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell $1.22, or 2.52%, to $47.10 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. In its monthly report released Tuesday, the IEA said the slowdown in global oil demand growth has accelerated in the third quarter of 2016, sinking to 800,000 barrels a day\u20141.5 million barrels a day lower than the third quarter of 2015. The IEA added that demand growth has \u201call but vanished\u201d in developed countries and slowed down drastically in Asian powerhouse consumers such as China and India. This has led the IEA to cut its 2016 demand growth forecast by 100,000 b/d to 1.3 million b/d. It added that the forecast would have been even lower if it wasn\u2019t for the 200,000 b/d premium it has included due to the expected return to a normal winter after last year\u2019s mild temperatures. The more pessimistic demand forecast comes a day after a report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that painted a picture of a world still awash in crude thanks to resilient output from U.S. producers and others. OPEC revised its forecast for non-OPEC supply upward by 180,000 b/d in 2017. The downsized demand forecast drove crude prices lower, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates. \u201cIncreasing supply expectations crisscrossing the downward adjustments in global demand, that keeps global inventories on an upward track into new high territory,\u201d he said.

But a sharp drop in the price of oil, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main revenue source, has forced the government to withdraw some benefits this year\u2014raising the cost of living in the kingdom and hurting its middle class, a part of society long insulated from such problems. Saudi Arabia heads into next week\u2019s meeting of major oil producers in a tight spot. With a slowing economy and shrinking foreign reserves, the kingdom is coming under pressure to take steps that support the price of oil, as it did this month with an accord it struck with Russia. \nThe sharp price drop is mainly because of a glut in the market, in part caused by Saudi Arabia itself. The world\u2019s top oil producer continues to pump crude at record levels to defend its market share. One option to lift prices that could work, some analysts say, is to freeze output at a certain level and exempt Iran from such a deal, given that its push to increase production to pre-sanction levels appears to have stalled in recent months. Saudi Arabia has previously refused to sign any deal that exempts arch-rival Iran. As its people start feeling the pain, that could change. The kingdom is grappling with major job losses among its construction workers\u2014many from poorer countries\u2014as some previously state-backed construction companies suffer from drying up government funding.\"  \naudi consumers in major cities, the majority of them employed by the government, have become more conscious about their spending in recent months, said Areej al-Aqel from Sown Advisory, which provides financial-planning services for middle-class individuals and families. That means cutting back on a popular activity for most middle-class Saudis: dining out. \u201cMost people are ordering less food or they change their orders to more affordable options,\u201d she said.\nTo boost state finances, Saudi Arabia cut fuel, electricity and water subsidies in December, after posting a record budget deficit last year. It also plans to cut the amount of money it spends on public wages and raise more non-oil revenue by introducing taxes. But in response to these moves, inflation more than doubled from last year to about 4% now, crimping consumers even more. The government doesn\u2019t have much choice. Saudi Arabia\u2019s real growth in gross domestic product slowed to 1.5% in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, according to its statistics office, and Capital Economics says data suggest it may have contracted by more than 2% in the second quarter. Much of that slowdown is related to consumer-facing sectors, which have struggled since the start of 2016 as rising inflation has eroded household incomes. The political stakes for managing this slowdown are high. Saudi Arabia survived the Arab Spring unrest that toppled several autocratic leaders across the region and forced some others to change, largely by offering cash handouts and more government jobs to placate its people. About two thirds of Saudi workers are employed by government related entities. Besides cushy jobs, such middle-class Saudis also received substantial overtime payments and regular bonuses. At the time of s ascension to the throne early last year, King Salman ordered a hefty bonus payment to government employees. Such largess is looking like a thing of the past. Besides cutting state handouts such as subsidized electricity and water, the government also plans to reduce money it spends on public wages to 40% of the budget by 2020 from 45% as part of its ambitious plan to transform the oil-dependent economy. It aims to cut one-fifth of its civil service as well.\" Bloomberg summarizes the history.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/saudi-aramco and official word is early 2018 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-08/saudi-arabia-said-poised-to-add-boutique-adviser-for-aramco-ipo How likely is the price of oil to rebound in 2017?

Prices immediately went on a tear, entering bull market territory and breaking $50 a barrel last month. Prices have since fallen back, with Brent crude, the international benchmark, trading at $47.64 a barrel.

It\u2019s now finding more reasons to be optimistic about the biggest Arab economy.\nSpending cuts and measures including the gradual reduction of energy subsidies mean that the budget deficit will probably fall to 9.6 percent of economic output in 2017 from 13 percent this year, according to Tim Callen, the IMF\u2019s Saudi mission chief. The shortfall was 16 percent in 2015.\n\u201cThe fiscal adjustment is under way, the government is very serious in bringing about that fiscal adjustment,\u201d Callen said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the progress that\u2019s being made.\u201d\nThe kingdom responded to the drop in crude prices by laying out a plan for the biggest economic shakeup in decades, including imposing value-added taxation, selling stakes in state-owned companies and cutting the public-sector wage bill. But while the retrenchment has brought the economy back from the brink of collapse, the government isn\u2019t finding easy answers to offset its impact on growth.\"\nand\n\"We would be worried if the fiscal deficit were to remain at the levels it reached last year for another couple of years, because that would mean there will be large fiscal financing requirements,\u201d he said.\" October 2016 seems to be  the month, the 2017 budget will be anounced.

Exxon- Mobil has not written down yet.\nSee http://www.wsj.com/articles/when-should-a-company-write-down-assets-1474064470\nWell oil is a rapidly degrading and depleting asset. \"Exxon Mobil Corp. is under scrutiny for a question that\u2019s fraught for any business: When should a company decide its assets literally aren\u2019t worth it? New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating why the oil giant hasn\u2019t written down the value of its assets even as others have done so due to plummeting crude prices. It is an issue that is particularly knotty in the energy industry, where the rules about valuing and writing down assets are complex. And a lot depends on what a company expects for the future: Will oil prices rebound, or stay mired below $50 a barrel? The answer can make a big difference for investors -- if a company decides its assets have lost value and should be written down, it hurts earnings and book value, or a company\u2019s net worth. And the leeway allowed in making that decision means there is always a motivation for a company to be overly optimistic about the future to avoid an earnings hit today. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a temptation all the time,\u201d said Dan Amiram, an associate professor of business accounting at Columbia University\u2019s business school. Companies \u201cwill use discretion in accounting to push the envelope\u201d away from taking write-downs. But some in the oil industry said Exxon has a good reputation for avoiding aggressive accounting practices. And they think it may be justified in not writing down its assets. \u201cThey love stability, they are one of the most compliant companies in the business,\u201d said John Hofmeister, a former president of Royal Dutch Shell PLC\u2019s U.S. business. In a statement Friday, Exxon said its results were in accordance with accounting and reporting rules. It declined to comment on The Wall Street Journal\u2019s report of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s investigation. A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman declined to comment. And debate about write-downs isn\u2019t limited to the energy industry. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, banks faced scrutiny over decisions to avoid write-downs of some risky, hard-to-trade securities. In other industries, some companies won\u2019t write down the value of \u201cgoodwill,\u201d the intangible asset typically generated when one company buys another, even as peers have done so. Adding complexity to the question of when a write-down should occur in the energy industry: the way oil and gas reserves are recorded as assets to begin with depends in part on whether they can be extracted, and whether it is cost-effective to do so. The oil-price crash has led some companies to take big write-downs. Chevron Corp., for instance, recorded write-downs and other noncash charges totaling $2.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting \u201clower oil prices and our ongoing adjustment to a lower oil price world,\u201d the company said. Shell took $3.7 billion in write-downs in 2015 to reflect a weaker long-term outlook for energy prices, plus another $4.6 billion for scrapping Alaska drilling and Canada oil-sands projects. Exxon maintains the value of reserves tied to decades-long projects shouldn\u2019t be affected by price fluctuations it views as temporary. The company did acknowledge in its latest annual report that future write-downs are possible if long-term price increases don\u2019t materialize. And Exxon is careful, testing a potential investment under every price scenario before committing to it, so that even a prolonged price slump won\u2019t derail the project, said Derek Ryder, a retired reservoir engineer specializing in reserves accounting who spent most of his career as an executive at Exxon subsidiary Imperial Oil. The company is particularly reluctant to write down an asset because that removes its value permanently, he noted. \u201cImpairment is a one-way trap door. Once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone,\u201d said Mr. Ryder, who says he wrote a manual in the 1990s that standardized Exxon\u2019s reserves-booking policy. That was at the behest of Rex Tillerson, then head of corporate planning and now Exxon\u2019s chief executive. Sometimes companies differ on how to value assets even on the same project. At a Nigerian oil-drilling project in which both Exxon and French oil giant Total SA are partners, Total took a write-down in February, while Exxon didn\u2019t. Oil and gas accounting specialists said the two companies may not have valued the assets the same way, and noted U.S. accounting rules Exxon follows differ in some respects from international standards followed by Total. The leeway companies have around write downs may also make it hard for regulators to prove any wrongdoing on Exxon\u2019s part, Mr. Amiram said. \u201cIt will be very difficult in this case unless there\u2019s a smoking gun,\u201d he added.\"  So will the Saudis wait as this asset plummets and every major but Exxon have written down over $10-billion? do not think so.\nthere is no Plan B\nhave to.\nAramco reserves and price have to be accurate in any registration In US or EU\n Saudi monarchy has no regulations.\nOil market can be a stern taskmaster.

Buyer Beware\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/opinion/a-saudi-ipo-buyer-beware.html\nBy THE EDITORIAL BOARDMAY 27, 2016 In January, when the Saudi royal family first floated the idea of selling shares in Saudi Aramco, the kingdom\u2019s oil company, many analysts regarded the proposal as an intriguing nonstarter. They were intrigued because even a partial privatization could create a company larger than Exxon Mobil, the world\u2019s largest publicly owned oil company. They were skeptical because initial public offerings on global exchanges require disclosure and scrutiny, as well as a record of transparent corporate governance. These are not Aramco\u2019s strong points. The idea got another look this month, when King Salman issued several royal decrees to revamp the oil ministry and other agencies. The decrees were seen as support for \u201cSaudi Vision 2030,\u201d a development plan released in April by the deputy crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to modernize the Saudi economy and society by ending its oil dependence and perhaps making other limited reforms. The crux of the plan is an I.P.O. of a stake in Aramco to help finance the kingdom\u2019s transformation. The king\u2019s endorsement increases the chances that an I.P.O. will occur, though the scale of the offering remains unclear. It could be relatively small and restricted to Saudi investors, thus avoiding the need for the heightened transparency normally associated with I.P.O.s. Conversely, despite the lack of transparency, a larger offering could be in the cards, promoted in part by bankers and consultants who stand to reap a fortune in fees on the transaction. Either way, an Aramco I.P.O. raises questions, and what investors don\u2019t know about the company \u2014 the accuracy of its claimed oil and gas reserves, for instance \u2014 is only one of them. An investment in Aramco would also be an investment in a kingdom that systematically represses women, and hence, in human and social capital. None of the many officials named to new posts in the decrees were women. Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter\nEvery weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world. Though ostensibly aimed at modernization, neither the development plan nor the decrees propose changes in the kingdom\u2019s basic political arrangements, in which religious fundamentalists uphold the legitimacy of the royal family in exchange for freedom to foster and spread extremist ideology. There is also no explanation of how even a big infusion of cash would build new industries from nothing and transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s estimated 20 million subjects into self-supporting employers and employees. Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the credit rating agency, alluded to all that when it downgraded Saudi Arabia a week after the decrees were issued, citing the kingdom\u2019s reduced ability to \u201cweather future shocks\u201d in the face of lower growth, higher debt and dwindling financial reserves low oil prices. In Moody\u2019s view, it is too soon to tell if the new plan will revive the credit rating or if the proposed reforms can be achieved without causing social unrest. Saudi Arabia desperately needs to modernize, and even talking about that need is a step forward. But neither the Saudis nor their global bankers should pretend that an I.P.O. of Aramco, as the company is currently configured, is a viable means to that end."], [368, "2016-06-16T18:53:46Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2016-06-16T17:56:14Z", [0.77], ""], [368, "2016-06-15T21:57:45Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2016-06-15T18:32:23Z", [0.78], ""], [26132, "2016-06-15T16:44:46Z", [0.95], "They seem to be following the Ali Baba sleight of hand: Offering a minority participation priced as if it was a majority offering.

The opening of Aramco for foreign investment may recall the decision Saudi Arabia made to nationalize the oil during the embargo and, given that Saudi Arabia is not on political solid ground,  will cause investors to think twice is their investment is safe there.   Another challenge is in the reaction of foreign involvement in their greatest holding. It was one of the original rantings of Bin Laden, that the West was undermining Saudi Arabia in the cash flow of Saudi oil and industry.  His anger had nothing to do with Israel, or Iran, or the other tropes, but one of what he perceived of financial inequality between Saudi Arabia's commodities and the influence of their Western partners, in 1995, to his letter to then King Fahd.  The other issues were included later when he began to lose relevancy and territory for Sunni Arabs . Investment, they say, will demonstrate transparency, but transparency and  anti-corruption is not welcomed. In 2015 they ranked 1 in business secrecy and 48th in corruption. https://www.transparency.org/country/#SAU  Any attempts to do away with corruption is limited, making them a non-friendly investment area in the near future.  The price of ail is low due, on some level,  to Saudi Arabia's and others in the less influential OPEC,, decision to suffocate their competitors by bringing oil prices lower, in the belief they had enough reserve funds to withstand the loss of revenue. Although their competitors such as Venezuela and Russia lost revenue in their oil sales, it did not attend to Saudi Arabia's goal since the prices went beyond their control to where if prices would rise to 70,00 (USD) next year, it is not going to stop the damage it made with oil producers that need high oil prices to sustain an economy. If they raise prices, then Iran will ride in their slip stream and they do not want Iran to profit from oil  The largest exports are oil and refined chemicals and their biggest imports are countries that are also large exports in a period where exporting is in a bad, particularly since several of the their leading customers also export commodities. The Saudi economy is in trouble and a sale of Aramco, if only 5% is a good move, but not when an export country is selling but because other countries are not buying.  More so, a commodity that is not rising and one that is eventually going out of favor for new energy is a temporary investment, but one that has little future as it goes beyond maturity. They are selling a commodity they no longer want, as the future for them, they believe, is in alternative energy.
