Main sub-question:\n1. Who has major interest in re-introducing SWIFT in Iran? What would have to happen for a stakeholder to oppose SWIFT ban to be lifted? \n1a. IRGC - likelihood of support 80%, weight in decision 15%\nIRGC plays a major role in business in Iran, business units of IRGC own major stakes in Iranian companies which will be greatly impacted by SWIFT decision. Firstly, SWIFT will allow Iranian corporations to wire money internationally and thus have an access to international markets to buy export but mainly to import much needed technology, spare parts etc. One of the biggest benefactors will be from oil industry where IRGC plays a key role. Secondly, on the other hand SWIFT will make it easier for foreign companies to access Iranian market and therefore intensify competition in many monopolistic / oligopolistic industries in Iran, this can potentially harm economic interest of IRGC.\nConclusion: It seems that the economic interest for IRGC is more strong in introducing SWIFT in Iran. The likelihood that they will favor the decision is in my view more than 80%. The risk to the scenarios are: some strong fraction with IRGC will have significant interests in guarding monopolistic position and will initiate steps that can put the process in the danger \n1b. International companies - likelihood of support 100%, weight 50%\nInternational companies have probably the strongest incentive to introduce SWIFT in the country as this is an essential step in re-enetring the market in Iran\n1c. P 5+1 Governments likelihood of support 70%, weight 35%\nUS, UK, France, China, Russia plus Germany\nGroup 1 (France, Germany) - strong business interest, countries sent delegations right after the signature of the deal...eg. PSA (Peugeot) is already in the process of re-establishing its operations with Iranian conglomerate Khodro. These countries will easily sell this at home to its voters - SWIFT / Iranian market access can boost sales of French and German companies. France, Germany have skin in the game in case the deal does not work with Iran but much less than USA and UK\nLikelihood of support 90%, weight 35%\nGroup 2 (Russia, China) - complicated group of countries, they want to do business with Iran but at the same time, the countries are already doing business in Iran. SWIFT will mean more competition for their companies \nLikelihood of support 45%, weight 20%\nGroup 3 ( US, UK) - US and UK companies want to definitely do a business with Iranian companies but the governments have not only economical interests but also can suffer a lot from potential failure of the deal. However, local companies that might be interested to do business in Iran will be lobbying the governments + selling SWIFT to voters might not be that touchy topic \nLikelihood of support 65%, weight 45% SUM point 1\nlikelihood 87%, weight 97% 2. What are the chances that international transaction can be carried out in a different way than via SWIFT?\nIn my view, it is very unlikely\nlikelihood 3%, weight 3% SUM point 2\nlikelihood 3%, weight 3% TOTAL: 84% likelihood of SWIFT re-introduction in Iran"], [6583, "2015-11-01T04:16:28Z", [1.0], ""], [1448, "2015-11-01T00:09:10Z", [0.44], ""], [368, "2015-10-31T21:03:27Z", [1.0], ""], [4634, "2015-10-31T14:24:30Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2015-10-31T14:08:13Z", [0.99], ""], [368, "2015-10-30T20:58:13Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2015-10-30T13:53:38Z", [0.99], ""], [6158, "2015-10-30T00:21:53Z", [0.52], ""], [368, "2015-10-29T20:28:41Z", [1.0], ""], [3328, "2015-10-29T20:15:37Z", [0.8], ""], [532, "2015-10-29T20:12:46Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2015-10-29T17:13:27Z", [0.99], ""], [10359, "2015-10-29T03:26:42Z", [0.75], ""], [10359, "2015-10-29T03:24:54Z", [0.65], ""], [231, "2015-10-29T00:31:50Z", [0.94], ""], [231, "2015-10-29T00:31:44Z", [0.93], "Rouhani still insists end of this year: http://m.jpost.com/Middle-East/Irans-Rouhani-says-he-expects-sanctions-to-be-lifted-by-end-of-2015-430239#article=6017MTcxMzMzQTY0ODgxMDQ0MDEyMjcyODgwQjlBMEU1Q0Q="], [10308, "2015-10-28T22:13:53Z", [0.8], "Despite minor disputes over the terms of the agreement, I think the Aug. 1 date provides sufficient time for them to be resolved and for Iran to get SWIFT access."], [519, "2015-10-28T20:29:43Z", [0.9], "Iranians certainly seem to think so."], [368, "2015-10-28T19:55:21Z", [1.0], ""], [4634, "2015-10-28T19:38:23Z", [0.45], ""], [6411, "2015-10-28T18:30:26Z", [0.0], "Iran has a lot to lose if it doesn't comply with the deal.

Foreign Affairs This Week [newsletters@e.foreignaffairs.com] "], [3514, "2015-10-02T18:07:28Z", [0.35], "Re: the demand for marginal Iranian crude barrels: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-10/iran-gets-ready-to-sell-oil-to-the-world Notice that US companies are uninterested, whether for political reasons or b/c the oil price is low and we're close to import/export parity already anyway.   The list of Board of Directors for IAEA contains 1 US, 2 Swedes, 1 Japanese, 1 Egyptian.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency The IAEA reports informally to the Security Council, which is of course dominated by the US, and increasingly China.  China and Japan can already be sold Iranian oil even pre-sanctions, so SWIFT access for Iran doesn't change much for them.  If anything, the existing sanctions lead them to import goods for lower prices from Iran.  I think the IAEA will basically be US muppets overall since the US is dominant and the main ones that have beef w/ Iran:  \"U.S. Congressional opponents have threatened to cut off IAEA funding unless they receive confidential details of the agreement that gives inspectors access to information about Parchin.\"  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-25/iran-says-ballyhoo-over-parchin-won-t-hinder-iaea-inspection So I don't see an intense desire for the US to want to pass Iran.  But merely to upset Iran's desire for nuclear.  The simple act of doing inspections at all will allow the US to garner some intel, regardless of whether they pass Iran.  I think the US's incentive is to stall the inspection process. Re: the supply of marginal Iranian crude barrels: Iran has ramped up its production already, and the oil is already being sent to Europe or other places already.  http://iran-times.com/iran-trying-to-sell-oil-in-eu-at-discount/.   China just recently began importing Chinese barrels again after a 6-month break.  http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/30/reuters-america-update-1-iranian-condensate-exports-at-2015-high-as-china-resumes-buying-sources.html.  This appears to represent a 15% increase in condensate exports for Iran overnight.  This reduces the incentive for Iran to have to comply w/ inspection.  If they don't even need to pass, things could easily get delayed.  I actually think Iran would like to have nuclear weapons on tap, so this desire may get them to stall the inspectors indefinitely.  They have to weigh these desires to \"be their own man\" (http://iran-times.com/editor-says-leader-opposes-nuke-deal/) against having to sell oil at a little discount.  Meanwhile, Europeans are probably enjoying getting those barrels at discount.  The fact that the illegally-exported barrels are now being sold through private co's and by telephone absolves the NOIC of direct responsibility. Oil is in contango and Iran owns a large number of oil shippers, so Iran's financial incentive is to keep its tankers fully loaded, serving as additional storage.  Only once the storage is maxed out would Iran want to export.  \"Windward, a Tel Aviv operated maritime data and analytics company, estimated this week that Iran was storing 43.098 million barrels of crude and condensate on vessels at sea, down from 54 million barrels in early July.\"  http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/30/reuters-america-update-1-iranian-condensate-exports-at-2015-high-as-china-resumes-buying-sources.html.  So that tells me there is no immediate need to get tankers unloading crude, since they can make more storing more on tankers and selling later-dated futures to hedge them. Re: Syria, I'm not sure if Russia's fresh attacks will increase or decrease the Qud's involvement, which would escalate or de-escalate tensions w/ the US on that front.  But w/ Iran verbally approving of Russia (http://en.trend.az/iran/politics/2438747.html), I don't see much de-escalation w/ the US there even if Quds aren't heavily active there. Overall, the impetus to pass inspections doesn't seem as strong as it publicly may appear.  That said, a deal was made, so presumably Iran does want to follow through w/ sanction release, unless Iran did the deal merely to entice buyers of its goods to increase purchases w/ the idea being that Iran is about to get paid more through a free market, so buyers \"better act now,\" which would only be a temporary benefit that probably wasn't worth the trouble of going through with the deal just for that.  But Rouhani got elected on a platform promising an economic boost from negotiating sanctions, so he probably wants this done.  The main thing I'm wondering is whether the US is just playing w/ Iran.  I think they'll pass eventually, but probably not by end of July. The Tehran stock market index peaked along w/ the signing of the deal on 7/15/15.  http://new.tse.ir/en/indices.html.  Classic sell-the-news timing there.  World markets have dropped since then, and Tehran's drop isn't excessive in comparison.  But if sanctions were going to lift soon, I would expect some eventual follow-through to occur on the stock market.  Don't forget to mentally adjust the chart down ~15% on an annual basis due to inflation and currency devaluation relative to the USD.  In real terms, then, the chart looks even weaker.

For those who took part in the GJP, consider some of the nuclear-related questions that were launched in past seasons: -Japan nuclear restart: Launched season 2 (or 3) and resolved last week.\n-Dabaa nuclear plant construction begins: Launched season 2 (or 3) and they're still working on it.\n-Australian export of uranium to India: Launched season 1 and still in the process of happening.
