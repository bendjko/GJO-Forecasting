American country b/f 1/7/16: A. On the one hand, the quick response is none.  However, although the attached note does NOT address the above mentioned Q, a more nuanced, considered judgement is: it DOES provide more circumstantial evidence of Russian primary geopolitical military focus and, engagement. http://www.australianetworknews.com/russian-president-vladimir-putin-threatens-nato/\n\"...Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear today that his country will be responding against the recent US move of deploying a ground-based missile defense system in Romania...Putin threatened NATO during a news conference held in Athens after he met with Greek Prime Minister Aleksis Tsipras. He is in Greece in what is widely viewed as a visit to mend damaged relationship with the European Union...\" Comment: W/ thirty two (32) days left to resolution of this forecast, CAVEAT NB to myself 8/5/16 forecast. Same rationale there applies here.  NB: Attempting to forecast a Putin move is fraught w/ high probability risks. Not to mention the Brier Score forecast of 0 effects of a \"gummy boat exercise w/ a Mexican/Caribbean Country\" before 1/7/16! Game over for me, unfortunately.  This said, the recent NATO threat keeps Putin where he strategically has placed himself over the past six months - on the political stage.  A gummy boat exercise w/ an above mentioned Country is possible but, would argue here, considering the totality to his recent actions & MACHO manner, such a peanuts exercise makes him look a little foolish. For a full blooded flotilla exercise in this region of the world he has no additional time. The funds used for such a show are better spent elsewhere.  In the Middle East (ME) an increasingly clear pivot towards a \"leveraged ME influence\" in Syria has left Russia better off today on future negotiations than it was six months ago.   Additionally, Russian OPEC interests in the region, including Iran & other Gulf Countries, will require continued focus. Putin's  pivot towards the Far East w/ China & Japan show his clear objective in achieving a disharmony b/w G7 members ( PM Abe & Putin efforts @ improving relations over dispute islands issue). Abe's visit to Sochi.

So, it's always a possibility.  That said, from a top down perspective ( outside view if you like)  Putin's focus continues to be on improving his G7 standing &, achieving support to get Russia out of the sanctions doghouse and, have the UN back off its multifaceted sanctions regime.  His recent meeting w/ PM Abe of Japan in Sochi, Russia is one example of Putin's strategic objective to keep himself on an international stage ( albeit - this being an island dispute). Importantly, Abe has essentially turned down an Obama recommendation not to visit w/ Putin w/ the recent Sochi meeting. Correctly, Abe has every right to consider his domestic interests. On the other hand, Putin clearly calculated such an event some time ago and, is clearly motivated to show the West he is flexible when Russian interests are aided. More importantly, should the Russians take on such an exercise in the Western Hemisphere w/ a Central or S. American country b/f 1/7/16, the event would put Putin in a detrimental/negative light on his serious effort @ receiving an official invitation from Abe to Japan at some point this year to find a resolution of the islands issue. Abe has already his interest in doing so while not being specific a date.  Much to the contrary. There is a high probability ( >75%) Putin has a vested interest in avoiding any \"blow back\"  on Abe ...from other G7 member countries during this phase... to assure Putin's strategically more critical objective: showing a potential break between G7 members on how to deal with Russia. Such a navel exercise, when considering the above mentioned, over the time line of this questions looks to be a 0 probability.

Russian activity in the Western Hemisphere first began with the sale of military equipment to Venezuela that soon transitioned into the two nations participating in joint naval exercises. It was believed that the Russia decision to launch the exercise came after the U.S. announced it would be reforming the 4th fleet to patrol the Caribbean.\n. . . \n\"Just a year after the Russian and Venezuelan naval exercise, the U.S. spotted Russian attack submarines patrolling off the coast of the U.S.  . . . it appeared to be part of an effort \"to project force around the world, or at least to take excursions around the world.\" This force projection was a clear message to the U.S. that they are capable to operate anywhere around the world, even in the U.S.'s back yard. \"Russian subs were detected operating incredibly close to U.S. data cables in 2015. While data cables near the U.S. coast commonly experience breaking or malfunctions, these cables are fixable within days. The fear from U.S. officials arose if the Russians cut a cable at extreme depths. The damages to these cables are much more difficult to find and fix, which could result in communications and internet access being down for weeks or even months. \"In September of 2015, the Russian research vessel, Yantar, sailed into the Caribbean around the same time the U.S. sub the Wyoming docked in Scotland. The Yantar is equipped with cable cutting equipment, but more importantly it is believed to have been conducting anti-submarine warfare operations against U.S. ballistic missile submarines based at Kings Bay, Ga.\n. . .\n\"Aside from expanding its naval presence, Russia has also sought to strengthen its relationships with South American governments. Outside of Venezuela, Russia has entered into discussions about using military bases with Nicaragua and Cuba. The Russian government has also sent military hardware to Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Peru, and Ecuador. All of these efforts are made to increase Russian influence in the region, and at best turn these nations against the U.S.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Most of this was news to me.  I have been searching for info on this question since it was launched, and this is the first I've found.  I think that Russia/Putin would announce such a naval exercise with a blare of trumpets well in advance; having not heard so much as a piccolo, I am inclined to agree with other forecasters who say that with low oil prices and so many other irons in the fire, Putin has neither the resources nor the time to rattle this saber.

Here, as we all know, a navel exercise of the sort asked by this GJ Q takes lots of planning and, time is of the essence w/ less than 90 days remaining for the 1/7/16 resolution.  In addition, definitional Qs arise in what constitute \"navel exercises\" et cetera. The \"fleet of ships\"  have to get there. That alone puts the world on notice.

Eventually NATO will back down and blaming Turkey for supporting terrorism. This will ratchet up tensions between Russia and NATO, and America will use the opportunity for more sanctions against Russia. I don't see Putin taking this lying down. Military drills in the western hemisphere seem like something Putin would like to do to signal his disapproval with America. The reason I rated the probability so low is because there are other ways to show his disapproval, and maybe he won't want to stoke the fire.

I am not sure how Syria being under control of Assad would affect oil prices? A more assertive Iran? Would Iran be more willing to help cut production to help oil prices rebound? The oil prices affect Russias economic outlook, and putins decision to stoke the fire or just weather any situation calmly. I would think after NATO blames Turkey their main fight against ISIS or hunt for terrorism would take a back seat to containing / confronting Russia. 1% above the average probability (of 9% at this time) = 10% probability of this outcome.

Viewed in this light Russia's continued aggression against any regional states threatening alignment to NATO, or critical military assets leaving the Russian sphere of influence is (and I would have said was)  was predictable. Hence the Russo-Georgian War, the Russian Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict, Russia-Ukraine conflicts and Annexation of Crimea (containing Sevastopol - home to their Black Sea fleet). While slightly further afield Syria has historically also been a key ally since 1946 - with a key Naval base in Tartus (Russia's only Mediterranean port). Taken in US context - a threat to both the Crimea and Tartus would be perhaps somewhat analogous to a threat against US bases in Guam or Hawai - so in this case its predictable that Russia will go the distance in both conflicts. However triggering new active conflicts in Latin American seems highly unlikely, especially with active conflicts elsewhere and depressed oil prices impact the Russian economy so badly. Cuba is currently drifting outside of Russian sphere of influence - and imho (give the end of the Cold War, MAD and advanced submarine based nuclear missiles) has far less strategic value now to Russia.  US is also moving towards normalising relationship with Cuba, likely to continue (assuming anyone but Neocons Republicans win the next election). Should US reverse this political Cuban detente increased Russian backing is perhaps possible - but only if Cuba feels seriously threatened (which would be counter US best interests, so seems highly unlikely).

This is worth a couple of probability points.  :) First, who are the likely candidates?  Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua have historically had the closest Russian ties.  However, each of these countries has problems and none of them has a \u201cblue water\u201d navy (or the need for one). Venezuela has suffered due to the drop in global spot oil prices, but has trained with the Russians as recently as 2015.  Therefore, they have the equipment (electronic systems for secured communication) and ships capable of maneuver with the Russians.  I figure they are the most likely, but, since they have just had a training evolution, I don't believe they are too likely. Cuba's economy is weak, but, with relations with the US picking up, they should marginally improve if they can develop tourism.  Cuba will probably not want to provoke a US reaction so close to obtaining better economic ties.  However, their navy is in a good position to train with the Russians. Nicaragua spends very little of their GDP on military items.  (A good reference is the CIA World Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook.)  I don't see them as being able to train successfully with the Russian navy.  Contrary to one of the given articles, I think Nicaragua would prefer closer ties to China than to Russia. The long shots are Brazil and Argentina because they have relatively serious naval resources.  The political climate in Brazil is capable of supporting nothing like joint exercises with the Russians.  Argentina is interesting because of the Falkland Island dispute with the UK.  However, I don't see them taking this on either, especially with a new government in place. Then there is Russia itself.  They are engaged with Ukraine, but that has mostly stabilized.  Russia is actively engaged in Syria.  The Russian navy is scheduled for joint exercises in the Far East with China in 2016 (http://sputniknews.com/world/20151024/1029053988/china-russia-joint-naval-drills.html).  The Russians also made an announcement last year of training exercises with North Korea.  While Russia is capable of doing multiple things at the same time, I don't see them as doing an exercise in the western hemisphere at this time due to low ROI. What could change my mind?  1) A date certain announcement from Russia of such an exercise.  2) What would be a seen as a provocative action from the US which demanded a response in the neighborhood of the US.  3) If Venezuela, Cuba or Nicaragua were to politically destabilize and Russian presence would mitigate it and support the current regimes."], [15181, "2016-01-14T00:07:23Z", [0.2], "Russia will go to the edge and beyond to ensure that it has everyone's attention.

Very thorough and straight-forward.  Venezuela, right now, has an economy that is absolutely spinning out of control + the Chavez government has been thoroughly trounced and discredited. They have enough internal problems and likely won't focus on military in the very short term. \nIn my mind, Cuba is also out. The Obama and Castro regimes have put far too much effort into thawing relations to let something like a naval exercise with Russia mess it up (I feel such an exercise that is practically within US coastal waters would be incredibly provocative on Cuba's part). \nNow, if a Republican president takes office a year from now and freezes relations with Cuba again - or starts issuing threats - then, I feel it is very well within the realm of possibility that Cuba may invite Russian vessels into their waters to conduct drills.  Nicaragua, however, is a very different story. \nhttp://fusion.net/story/108985/nicaraguas-interest-in-russian-fighter-jets-could-trigger-the-stupidest-arms-race-ever/\nAs we can see, Nicaragua has a military force that is incredibly small compared to that of its neighbor. However, by inviting the Russian navy to participate in drills, they could show Colombia that they too, have powerful friends (while Columbia has the United States). The fact that Nicaragua may be buying Russian fighters only seems to make this a more attractive possibility. Meanwhile, for Russia, the results would be obvious: a chance to show the United States Russia's global reach.  On the other hand, I do believe that Russia has its hands full with Syria and likely has enough leverage there to force an abatement of sanctions. While it could be a good move to rattle the sabre a bit in America's backyard, at this point, it wouldn't be enough of a gain to justify doing...
