If we see these days religious motivated attacks as the major threat, we must see that 60% of the ehtiopian populations are christians. 30% are muslims (most of them sunnis but also diffent types of sufis) so the group with the highest risk of reliogios agression is much smaller than the rest of the population. This and the fact that the three big reliogions live more peacefully together than in other parts of africa makes it not very presumable that terroristic groups like ISIS find a broad acceptance in the muslim part of the population. Of course there is a high risk of smaller attacks by local fanatic groups, but not to organize a massive attack wich can kill that many people in short time. The backlash wich would hit the muslim part of the population could lead easyly to the reduction of islamic influence in ethiopia wich is ofcourse not in the interest of the more radical groups within the ethiopian muslim society. ISIS and other terroristic groups afflict northern africa since many years now, and if it would be so easy to get a foot into the door it would had happen when ISIS was on their peak of power. So i think it is not very probable that such an hard attack will strike in the next 10 months."], [40094, "2017-09-23T09:06:48Z", [0.0], ""], [39814, "2017-09-23T08:21:05Z", [0.05], ""], [35636,
