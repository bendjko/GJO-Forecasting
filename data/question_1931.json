I don't believe that the chance of this occurring is quite 0% or 1% at this point, given historical examples of leaders dying in office over the course of 11 months and revolutions in general. The average rate of chiefs of state dying over the last 20 years in office is about 2.25 per year, which would imply about a 1% chance. With the additive chance of revolution from protests, which Russia has suffered two of over the last 105 years (2% per year). I would estimate a probability of about 3% all other things being equal.

If he was setting up a way to resign he needs to minimize the risk of a political opponent finding a way to gain power. The odds of a Putin opponent gaining power seem miniscule but they also seem to be rising. Increased odds of a political opponent gaining power if he leaves is an incentive for him to stay in power.  I think the measurable odds are on his survival. The average Russian life expectancy is 71, Putin being wealthy & protected from violence puts himself in a better position to maintain his health. The probability of death for a 68 year old man in 2017 according to the Us social Security was 0.019693. Putin's resources should put him at an advantage in maintaining his health. An assumption can place him near 1%.  I'm basing my forecasts on Putin's ability to stay healthy in office, I don't think this is the best approach.

This podcast [2] is an excellent narrative of the \"power prison\" Putin has built for himself, and how his departure only becomes likely when the convoluted web of alliances, dependencies, appeasements, bribes, threats etc. can be maintained and assured as his personal legacy. Few obvious successors being prepped for imminent elevation [3] and no easy alternative mechanism to avoid the predicted (and highly destructive) power struggles that might result from a \"wrong pick\".  The petrochemical centric Russian economy seems to be on fragile (if stable) ground and is destined for a slow recovery [4].
