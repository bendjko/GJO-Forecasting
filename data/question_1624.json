Passenger traffic at the world\u2019s top 20 busiest airports grew by 1.7% in 2019. With more than 1.5 billion passengers passing through their terminals, this group of 20 represented 17% of global passenger traffic. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis, however, has brought airports around the world to a virtual standstill, resulting in airport traffic and revenue losses across all regions. ACI World now estimates a reduction of more than 4.6 billion passengers and more than US$97 billion in revenue for 2020. The combined 2019 and 2020 data shows the dramatic decline in air travel in the first quarter of 2020. In the top five, Beijing Airport notably experienced a -62.6% decline in passenger traffic but large decreases were also recorded across other top 20 airports in Asia-Pacific as the COVID-19 outbreak began to take hold in that region. https://aci.aero/news/2020/05/19/aci-reveals-top-20-airports-for-passenger-traffic-cargo-and-aircraft-movements/"], [691, "2020-12-08T17:29:55Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.16, 0.74], ""], [1034, "2020-12-06T22:24:28Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-06T14:38:30Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.7], ""], [691, "2020-12-06T13:52:52Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.14, 0.72], ""], [86554, "2020-12-04T22:11:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.79], ""], [691, "2020-12-03T20:31:07Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.14, 0.72], ""], [1333, "2020-12-03T15:10:34Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.3, 0.65], ""], [13306, "2020-12-03T07:04:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [62808, "2020-12-02T21:51:49Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-12-02T21:48:24Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-12-02T21:47:34Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [88422, "2020-12-02T17:20:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [79591, "2020-12-02T16:54:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [1333, "2020-12-02T15:46:41Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.21, 0.65], ""], [88452, "2020-12-02T11:30:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-01T15:52:32Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.2, 0.65], ""], [1333, "2020-12-01T14:20:20Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.18, 0.17], ""], [84880, "2020-12-01T03:52:01Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.15, 0.55], ""], [40584, "2020-11-30T15:28:03Z", [0.01, 0.32, 0.25, 0.42], ""], [86554, "2020-11-29T12:38:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.28, 0.72], ""], [88452, "2020-11-29T09:00:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [94632, "2020-11-28T20:45:08Z", [0.0, 0.83, 0.11, 0.06], ""], [22689, "2020-11-28T19:54:54Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [1034, "2020-11-28T04:11:19Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-11-28T02:34:44Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [28899, "2020-11-27T21:13:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [27661, "2020-11-27T20:29:47Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [691, "2020-11-27T15:22:28Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [13306, "2020-11-27T03:05:04Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.28, 0.67], ""], [13306, "2020-11-27T03:03:55Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [88452, "2020-11-26T19:58:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.78], ""], [89035, "2020-11-26T19:13:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "Updating based on @kerryb comment: CAN = ~700 flights/day \nPVG = ~600 flights/day \nPEK = ~500 flights/day \nPKX = ~400 flights/day (still won't surpass DXB though this year) \nDXB = ~200 flights/day I am estimating that DXB lands in the #12 spot behind ATL, DFW, ORD, CAN, PVG, DEN, HND, PEK, LX, DEL and AMS It will be close though so hedging a touch in the 7 - 9 spot."], [1333, "2020-11-24T18:02:16Z", [0.0, 0.72, 0.18, 0.1], ""], [88452, "2020-11-24T11:49:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [1333, "2020-11-24T05:20:02Z", [0.0, 0.72, 0.17, 0.11], ""], [40584, "2020-11-23T22:02:38Z", [0.05, 0.7, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [1034, "2020-11-23T18:10:57Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1646, "2020-11-23T14:19:43Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.37, 0.48], ""], [1333, "2020-11-22T14:40:06Z", [0.0, 0.73, 0.17, 0.1], ""], [1034, "2020-11-22T08:06:40Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-11-21T19:15:39Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [84880, "2020-11-21T04:26:44Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.29, 0.21], ""], [1333, "2020-11-20T15:37:25Z", [0.0, 0.72, 0.18, 0.1], ""], [89035, "2020-11-19T04:15:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], "2019 top airports: 1.

For the first quarter, the number of travelers were down by about 20% through Dubai [1]. The traffic for Dubai airport is heavily dependent (unsurprisingly) on flights by Emerates and flydubai, if looking only at destinations served [2]. Emerates started flying again to a selection of destinations as of May 21st [3]. Dubai was ranked 4th for Q1 for total passengers [4]. With these considerations in mind, all airports are likely to be facing similar restrictions to the movement of travelers through them. The critical question for Dubai, since it serves as a connector between the East and West hemispheres, is how full will those international flights be? Will there be a need to do as many long-haul trips as there were pre-COVID? HBR thinks there will be some decrease in globalization tendencies, but that they won't be breaking up completely [5].  With that in mind, I am thinking the Q1 numbers will most likely hold, with Dubai in 4th-ish place. If globalization breaks further, than it will drop further. There may be a small chance of it being one of the few connections open between the East and West, which may push its passenger totals up higher.
