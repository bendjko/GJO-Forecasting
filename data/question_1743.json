Most recently, Hezbollah was very candid with their intensions, \u201cand it vowed to remain committed to fighting Israel, as the country is paralyzed by its worst economic and financial crisis\u201d (Times of Israel, 2020). Hezbollah wants to present a unified and strong front, however there are higher priorities.

However, everything that has unfolded because of COVID-19 have caused a drastic change in direction.

On August 25, Israel carried out air attacks on Hezbollah observation posts in Lebanon. This came as a response to a security incident that occurred at the border. The activity was later identified as gunshots directed at IDF troops. Israel and Lebanon are still technically at war, and the United Nations force UNIFIL is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire. An incident a month earlier occurred when two drones packed with explosives targeted the group's stronghold in south Beirut. An additional confrontation unfolded when supposed Hezbollah fighters attempted to sneak across the border. On August 29th, Israeli tanks carried out strikes against Hamas posts in the Gaza Strip in response to the previous day\u2019s launching of airborne incendiary devices into Israel, which sparked at least 23 fires in the south of the country. While not devastating, this attack against Israel was coordinated with a manifesto calling for a long-term campaign against their enemies by Hezbollah.\u00a0\n\tPublic relations between the two parties have also evaporated due to the UAE and Israel's announcement to normalized relations, a decision which is seen by Lebanon as a serious threat. Hezbollah later condemned Bahrain\u2019s move to normalize Israel ties on September 12. Hezbollah is the world\u2019s most heavily armed non-state actor per the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They possess manpower capabilities which are estimated at 30,000 fighters with a reservist corps that could draw upon another 10,000 to 20,000 combatants. In addition, they possess extensive technology such as surface to air missiles. Israel\u2019s military stands at roughly 169,500, including 102,500 conscripts; however, they are spears across a larger area and are forced to be more defensive. Thus, Hezbollah will continue to utilize similar patterns and tactics to instigate violence along the border.\n\tHezbollah is facing a major internal crisis in the shape of government mismanagement and years of slow growth which has saddled Lebanon with one of the world\u2019s highest public debt burdens. Protests have erupted spending several religious and cultural backgrounds. In August 2020, when an UN-backed tribunal found Salim Jamil Ayyash, a Hezbollah affiliate, guilty of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. This further factor has placed Hezbollah in a position where their very survival as an organization may be dependent on regaining prestige through the use of violence. Therefore, the trend of violence will with a moderate degree of certainty result in the death of a member of one of these two sides prior to November 14th.\u00a0\n\u2028\nSources\nhttps://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah\nhttps://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/lebanons-hezbollah-condemns-bahrain-move-to-normalize-israel-ties-642035\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-hezbollah-leaders-meet-to-discuss-israeli-ties-with-arab-world/#gs.fz7gnq\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/israel-launches-air-attacks-hezbollah-posts-lebanon-border-200826061432456.html\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-tanks-strike-hamas-posts-in-gaza-in-response-to-arson-balloons/#gs.fz6t8k\nhttps://www.cfr.org/event/future-us-israel-relations-symposium\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Counting-the-Cost-FINAL.pdf \u2028\n"], [95292, "2020-10-08T18:53:03Z", [0.25], "There has been an ongoing proxy war since 2000 which has led to a build-up of tensions between nations.

According to the IDF, since the 20 July airstrike, Hezbollah has attempted to cross the U.N established \"Blue Line\" border and has shot at Israeli soldiers, increasing tensions between the belligerents. Hezbollah's \"equation of deterrence\" policy makes it likely that more retaliatory attacks will occur, likely resulting in Israeli casualties. Even if deaths do not occur for Israel, they will likely respond with airstrikes. This assertion is based on how Israel has responded to recent Hezbollah incursions; shots fired at Israeli soldiers in August lead to multiple airstrikes against Hezbollah positions.

Then along the border of Lebanon, there is a vast amount of Israeli forces stationed in order to prevent any further attack from Hezbollah militants. Along this border Israel has deterred a number of small attacks from Hezbollah forces, but has decided to not pursue them into Lebanon. All of these actions from Israel are strictly preemptive and are based on Israel\u2019s desire to only protect its people and interests. In all, Israel does not want to escalate the conflict with Hezbollah in order to avoid unnecessary conflict. Presently, Hezbollah has been reluctant in escalating the conflict due to their fear of inferiority to the Israeli military and their incapability to launch a large scale attack. In addition, the US has placed sanctions on Libanese forums and leaders that have ties to Hezbollah.

On the other hand, \"one fatality\" is a very low - almost accidental - threshold, this is a difficult question.  What seems to be a good contextual base is the concept of \"balance of deterrence\", in which neither side wants an open confrontation in the view of possible repercussions, because the enemy is geared over time to inflict the greatest damage on my army in case I attack. Together with some UN presence, this seems like a fairly credible answer to the question of how is it that Israel and Lebanon are at war since 2006 with virtually no casualties on the border since then. You can find commentators that advance this argument in this specific case, arguing the incentive on either side to escalate is low (though miscalculated escalation can never be ruled out in such a setting).  But then there are the recent tensions and the low threshold of one fatality on either side. They exchange fire, Israel attacked observation posts, killed a Hezbollah soldier in Syria - the last point being the most important, as Hezbollah promised a revenge to deter Israel. And if confirmed that more Hezbollah fighters were killed in another attack today in Syria, the organization may be slowly put under more pressure to retaliate in kind if it's not to lose face. However, it seems quite important to note that Hezbollah leadership expressly refused to engage Israel on the Israel-Lebanon border, and that it stated it's \"in no rush\" to avenge the mujahedeen by killing Israeli soldiers. Overall, the situation is very untransparent and one fatality can never be ruled out (even though larger escalation probably could), but it seems that more indications exist that the Israeli-Lebanese border will not be the main theater where this confrontation shapes out.  Considering this and the fact that no death since 2006 on this border occurred despite recurrent exchanges of fire and air attacks (an incident nearly every year), my forecast will lean to a very uneasy \"no\". I will bet both sides have it under enough control (after so many years of a quite active mutual deterrence) and are sufficiently short of interests to escalate that they will avoid fatalities.

Syria is a much more likely location for lethal confrontation. An Israeli airstrike in Syria killed a Hezbollah operative on July 21. Despite this, operatives from Hezbollah seem to be avoided.  It is difficult to say if the explosion at the Beirut port makes lethal confrontation more or less likely. Support for aggressive foreign policy is not as strong as the support for domestic change. However, if the historical cliche of entering a conflict to distract from a domestic problem is statistically true, it could play out again. Netanyahu is facing his most challenging period in office and as I mentioned above, directing attention abroad could revive his popularity. But, success may be attributed to his main rival for office and current defense secretary Benny Gantz.  Any serious escalation would be catastrophic for both sides, regardless of who 'wins'. Both sides have an incentive to avoid all-out war. I think confrontation will continue in Syria and a miscalculation could result in a fatal incident in retaliation on either sides domestic territories.  An Israeli drone was shot down last night and last month Israel shot at Hezbollah soldiers breaching their border in the Golan heights. Tensions are high and have been for decades. A future lethal confrontation in Lebanon or Israel is likely. But before 14 November, less likely.

Given that there are 365 days in one year there is a 56 percent chance of an attack in any given year. The question however, specifically mentions a confrontation between Hezbollah and Israeli military forces. Of the attacks referenced in the Stanford CISAC (which is not a comprehensive list) only 2 explicitly mention the Israeli military. If there is an attack, there is a 10 percent historical chance that it will directly involve some kind of Israeli military presence leaving us with a base rate of 5 percent approximately. [1] However, we are also above average in terms of time between attacks. The last attack occurred about 800 days ago.  it is probably worth pushing this base rate up to say, for instance, 9 percent.  Hezbollah has insisted they will retaliate if Israel is found to have had any involvement in the Beirut bombing and the FBI is said to be consulting on the investigation. [2][3] While it\u2019s impossible to say what the FBI will find, we can apply some historical context to get a rough idea of the probabilities we\u2019re talking about here. A Department of Justice report from 2000 claimed that about 8 percent of all explosive incidents in the US have some kind of criminal intent. [4] Let\u2019s triple that for the Middle East which brings us to 24 percent. Criminal intent doesn\u2019t necessarily lead us to the conclusion that Israel perpetrated the bombing. Most of their targeted killings in the past decade have involved missile or bomb strikes of relative precision rather than some kind of mass casualty event. [5] At this point while tensions are certainly high, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that Israel will be found to have done anything untoward. It doesn\u2019t really fit their MO or match up with FBI stats. Even if Hezbollah was to make good on their threat in the event that something is uncovered, their own history shows they would rather attack civilian or political targets than military ones.  To put a finer point on a probability we could take the 5 percent base rate of Hezbollah attacks on Israeli targets, double it due to increased tension and add a couple extra points envisioning some kind of scenario where Hezbollah rebukes the US-led findings as inadequate and attacks. All of this in view of the fact that we have only 92 days until the question deadline which is also coincidentally the shortest period between Hezbollah attacks, occuring twice in twenty incidents.
