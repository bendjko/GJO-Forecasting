I then increase it by 10% as the current prediction still doesn't factor in the recent outbreak of communal violence between Hema cattle-herders and Lendu farmers in Ituri province. It is estimated that around 160 people were killed in communal clashes between these groups between 7 and 16 June. The security forces don't have the capacity and/or the inclination to prevent an escalation of the crisis. Moreover, around 50,000 were killed in clashes between these groups in the period of 1999-2007 and I believe that this history of deadly clashes makes a serious escalation more likely.\nWhile I think that EWP's statistical model overestimates the risk (31%) of a new outbreak because it is affected by data from the Kivus, which should be discounted, I still increase my forecast by further 5% to account for structural risk factors identified by the EWP's statistical model.  I admit that increasing by 5% and not by 4% or 6% in both cases is a purely arbitrary decision, but I am very new at this forecasting project and I am still trying to find a more constructive way to think about it.

See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 30.9%. [1] It's the highest ranked country in their data base.\n- Crowd forecast here is 3%. Inside view: \n- EWP already list one episode in the DRC as an ongoing mass killing: \"Insurgent groups in the Kivus intentionally target civilians as part of the ongoing series of conflicts.\" [2]\n- EWP also note that \"violence in the Kasai region, which has reportedly included serious abuses by the government and by non-state forces, could be a potential locus of a new mass killing.\" This seems to be justified. [4] However, I couldn't find new reports of violence since fall of last year which might indicate that things have improved. Those who have returned seem to have sparked another humanitarian crisis though. [5]\n- Between 500 and 900 people were killed in ethnic violence in December in Northwestern Congo. [3] A postponed election took place a few days ago, but I couldn't find anything on renewed violence. [6] Overall judgment:\n- Crowd forecast is clearly too low. EWP strikes me as a bit too high, given that the situation in Kasai seems to have improved.\n- Still, Kasai is a potential cause of another mass killing episode, so is Northwestern Congo apparently.\n- Adding in unknown unknowns, this leads me to estimate about 13%.
