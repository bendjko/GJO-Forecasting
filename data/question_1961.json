Most IPOs tend to outperform day 1, and certain ones tend to go up a large magnitude. $55b + valuation would imply Robinhood trades up more than 50% from its initial IPO price which is not impossible looking at some recent tech IPOs.

This would give the company a market cap of $31.8bn-35.1bn after the first day of trading. Historically, IPOs tend to outperform their valuation, due to underwriter incentives to underprice the stock and capture extra profit (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underpricing.asp), so on this basis, I would expect Robinhood's IPO to outperform its valuation by 15-20%, in line with historical norms (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trends-in-ipo-pops-2021-03-04). However, given Robinhood's unpopularity with the retail traders that will be making up 20-30% of its first-day shareholders, I would expect the \"IPO pop\" to be a bit more muted than normal, perhaps more around 10-15% (making the new first-day market cap in the $35bn-39bn range, approximately). The options given here are such that the question itself implies an IPO value of $40bn, so given my hypothesis outlined above, my distribution of outcomes skews to the lower end of the offered ranges. However, I believe the probability of the tail events (< $25bn or > $55bn) tends towards the more optimistic side of things, given how Robinhood offering a significant portion of their shares on their own platform might encourage more casual participants to get involved and curb some less positive action on the stock that may be coming from other retail traders. While these are both relatively extreme outcomes, I'm keeping the probability of each of them relatively high, as Robinhood's association with retail trading - and by extension, the \"meme stock\" frenzy that has resulted in names like GME and AMC trading at valuations with limited connection to fundamentals - makes it significantly more likely it could get caught up in that same kind of retail action, whether positive or negative - even on its first day of trading.

I estimate there to be a 1% chance that Robinhood drops >21% on its first day of trading, reducing its market cap to less than $25. On the other end of things, I estimate there to be a 1% chance that Robinhood gains >28% on its first day of trading, which would increase its market cap to over $45B. In terms of trading above or below $35B, this is very difficult to predict so I estimate the chances of each at 50%.

However, I would argue that this would not be a factor negatively affecting Robinhood's price because people forget about past events quickly, both suggested by both behavioral finance and anecdotal experiences. \nFor a commission-free brokerage like Robinhood, the most valuable asset for them is the number of active users and the trading in order for them to stay competitive in their core business of payment-for-order-flow. \nTo predict Robinhood's expected market close price, let us compare the following data among Robinhood and several publicly-traded brokers as of Q1 2021: Robinhood: \nNet revenue: $682 million\nUsers: ~20 million\nTrading volume: $350 billion Futu Limited Holdings (FUTU): \nMarket Cap: $21 billion\nTotal revenue: $283.6 million\nNet income: $151.7 million\nUsers: 14.2 million\nTrading volume: $289.0 billion Charles Schwab (SCHW): \nMarket cap: $137 billion\nUsers: 32 million\nTotal revenue: $4.7 billion\nNet income: $1.5 billion\nVolume: 8.4 million * 252 ~= 2.1 billion (this is # transactions, not in $) FUTU would be a more suitable comparison to Robinhood compared to SCHW, as they both primarily face retail investors. Using the more important metric, trading volume and user, by comparing to FUTU, Robinhood should be priced around $25-30 billion. \nHowever, if using revenue as the metric, by comparing to both FUTU and SCHW, Robinhood should be priced in the range $18~50 billion. \nGiven these two methods, I am more leaning towards the fair value of Robinhood being around $25-30 billion as trading volume and user should be the most suitable data to evaluate on.  At the first day, Robinhood could move towards my predicted fair value of $25-30 billion. More likely, giving present market sentiment and participation of retail investors and extrapolators, Robinhood can be traded higher, likely around 30% of the IPO price, due to its popularity at the first day, and slowly correct to the fair price, as many past IPO stock movements suggest.

Considering companies that went public in 2020, the median company that went public saw a 20% price hike on the first day, 25% of companies traded lower than their IPO price, and 28% traded 50% higher. Given that Robinhood is a very \u201chyped\u201d and polarizing product (given recent news), I\u2019d expect higher variance around its day-of market cap.

Robinhood has announced it will IPO during July, sometime after the July 4th weekend. It also announced it is expanding features such as the ability for customers to buy into IPOs including its own. Although Robinhood has announced its date, IPOs such as Hear.com have been delayed recently due to increased market volatility. Robinhood was valued at $12 billion in September 2020, and $40 billion in February 2021. With the retail investing industry rapidly growing, it is likely that the valuation could be above $40 billion by early July.  After examining typical first day IPO performance, we see that from the 61 companies that IPO'd in 2020, the median company increased its price by 20%. Given these numbers, Robinhood's expected market cap end-of-day would be $48 billion. Further looking at the 2020 IPOs, we see that only 25% of companies traded less than its IPO, and 28% ended the day with over 50% more.

According to most reputable sources, Robinhood is currently valued at $40bn from its February 2021 funding round. I don't want to use this number as an \"anchor,\" but think it's an important reference point for a 37.5% drop (25bn) or gain (55bn). I think the first day close will trend higher than the 40bn valuation as there will be little institutional selling given a presumed holding period, and retail investors have been found to trade on the magnitude of news rather than its directionality (i.e. positive or negative) in my brief examination of relevant finance literature in retail investor attention (i.e. Colaco, Hugh M. J. and De Cesari, Amedeo and Hegde, Shantaram P, 2016). Robinhood has certainly been in the news a lot and is a well-known brand. Hence, I've made my estimates more \"top-heavy\" as while I don't see a plausible scenario in which it trades at lower valuations like 25bn, the flipside is possible (i.e. direct listing for a higher price ~45bn, then buying pressure pushing the stock up by close). To quantify this impact, the average first-day IPO return in 2020 in the US was 36% (https://www.statista.com/statistics/914701/first-day-gains-after-ipo-usa/). Assuming 2021 follows similar patterns and $40bn is a fair valuation at IPO, using this average gain, it would finish first-day trading at $54.4bn. However, this value seems to be an outlier, and the median value before 2020 (which is stable) seems to be around 14% (implying $45.6bn). To add even more nuance, Robinhood interacts directly with retail investors. Due to the meme stock saga, the company's worsening brand reputation and amongst retail investors and evidently weak balance sheet might lead to a lower valuation upon IPOing. As for a delay, while it's certainly possible and happens in financial markets, I believe Robinhood has realized how weak its balance sheet is after the meme stock craze and will likely seek an opportunity to gain equity financing as an opportunity to restructure. They're currently aiming for an early July listing and have been considering a public listing for some time now. A piece of opposing recent precedent to consider is Coinbase (though it had a pre-listing valuation at 140bn, it closed its first day of trading at a valuation of 85.8bn) that might caution against my optimism. However, its 140bn valuation was privately closed at a time where decentralized finance was still relatively hot (and that hype died down really quickly afterwards); thus, I think explains its depreciation."], [101281, "2021-06-10T03:32:18Z", [0.02, 0.08, 0.2, 0.4, 0.25, 0.05], "Firstly, I think it is very likely that Robinhood will IPO before September, as many news articles are projecting the IPO in July, coupled with the fact that Robinhood recently introduced the \"early access to IPO\" feature which seems like it would be used for the purpose of their own IPO.

Thus, I predict around $50B for the IPO price, and made the rest of the distribution centered around there, with a fairly wide variance due to macro/market uncertainty and uncertainty on how much it will spike on the first day.

One concern is that WallStreetBets traders may try to short Robinhood due to its unpopularity there (due to the GME incident in January); however, on the day of an IPO there is likely initially only a small number of shares trading, which means that it will be harder to borrow/short the stock, which may reduce the short pressure (https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/062905.asp).

With more than 20 million active users, Robinhood was able to generate $682 million in Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) and continues to generate revenue as retail investors flood to the markets. I predict that Robinhood will most likely end its first day of public trading with a market capitalization of anywhere between 35-55 billion dollars, conditional on Robinhood going public within the next six months. This would represent a forecast of anywhere between -13% to 38% of its most recent valuation by Forbes in February 2021.

Therefore, this must be priced into the distributive model as it is possible that Robinhood will not go public for a duration of time, and therefore also continue to grow its market cap. If Robinhood does decide to go public prior to September 1, 2021, then there also exists the black swan event in which the majority of market participants will decide to short sell Robinhood stock, therefore driving the price down and causing Robinhood's market cap to be less than 25 billion.

S1 was filed on March 23, meaning they have more than 5 months, and most IPOs are 4 months or less from S1 to IPO. Airbnb was 4 months, and Roblox was 4 months after a delay, and Affirm 2 months after a delay. If everything goes smoothly it should almost definitely IPO before September 1. The two concerns are scrutiny by the SEC under Gensler and pricing issues as we come out of the pandemic and their user numbers become less clear.  Gensler was recently confirmed as head of the SEC, and he does not like Robinhood, he's written about stock picking being like dart-throwing, wants to study Robinhood's behavioral prompts (they recently removed the confetti likely as a response to this criticism, from him and others), as well as whether consumers are getting best execution in a payment for order flow system. Robinhood has been fined for best execution violations in the past (https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2019/finra-fines-robinhood-financial-llc-125-million-best-execution). The broader story about Robinhood seems to be one of fast and loose Silicon Valley meeting stricter regulations, and its not clear whether they've cleaned up their act enough since so little is public. Need for study and potential regulatory violations could lead to delays in the IPO process, but I don't think its super likely. Delaying an IPO would be a pretty significant action when the SEC can still impose fines and investigate misconduct regardless. The SEC is also working on ways to get more companies to go public instead of staying private, so an IPO delay would be an odd choice on their part as well. All that said, running afoul of regulators is a possibility nonetheless. The other concern is about getting a good price for institutional buyers. COVID and GameStop have sent Robinhood's user numbers and revenue skyrocketing which has served to inflate its valuation recently, but its unclear if these users will continue to use the app. GameStop is largely over, and there will likely be less trading as a pastime when the pandemic ends. These factors may be concerning to a potential institutional buyer who doesn't want to get into a company while it's riding a temporary high, when they could instead get into it when its numbers become more consistent and predictable (and lower) in the near future. If they meet this kind of resistance in the roadshow process then they may decide to delay the IPO, or the process may take longer than it otherwise would. I would hope that Robinhood has tested the waters for this type of resistance, but it's possible that it'll arise in the future as the pandemic wanes in the US and investors ask for more up-to-date user and volume numbers. It's also possible that Robinhood will make up for some lost demand with their program of getting users into the IPO process. Bets on the IPO prices as mentioned by @Spuerer1 are trading around $55B, so a lot of those users would likely be willing to pay a higher price. Its unclear if they could meet billions of dollars in demand though, since Robinhood users tend to be pretty small.  All those risks together put the chance of not IPOing before September around 17%. It'd be out of the ordinary, but there are legitimate risks that I'll need to monitor.  End of day price?\nI break this down into three pieces, which are what's its most recent valuation, what will be the IPO price, and what will be the IPO pop/drop. Most funding rounds are 5-8% of the valuation including for Robinhood's past rounds, and they recently raised $3.4B. This was due to the GameStop frenzy and an urgent need for a lot of capital so they probably sold more than they normally would've. 8% would put the valuation at $42.5B, but I'd guess it's higher at around 10%, putting the valuation around $35B or somewhere in the 30s.  As for the IPO price, its unclear if it would be a markup over that prior round. The investors were the same funds that did their prior rounds, so they may have just been infusing capital to make sure the company didn't blow up during an important moment so it would make it to IPO. In that case they'd probably push less for a markup over that price. It's also possible it was opportunistic buying at a lower price than they otherwise would've gotten, in which case the IPO price would be higher. A markup would probably be around 15% given the short timeline if I had to guess, with a ~50% chance of that markup happening.  Lastly the pop/drop. IPO pops have averaged 20% in 2020, but 25% of IPOs dropped on their first day, so there's a wide range attached. On one hand, Robinhood is a large company with widespread brand recognition as a successful tech company disrupting an industry, so that would favor a big pop as retail traders gain access. On the other hand, the inclusion of users in the pre-public offering may make a \"new\" higher price less justifiable since a lot of everyday people have already bought the stock at the IPO price, and Robinhood's gotten a lot of very public scrutiny recently around its business model built on PFOF. It's hard to say where public opinion is on them. The r/wallstreetbets crowd is decidedly against them, but the bets on the IPO valuation as mentioned before are ludicrously high. All that makes for a mixed bag, but ultimately skewing a bit negative. I end up estimating the first day pop around 15%, a bit below the base rate.  For getting percentages I did a monte carlo where the most recent valuation is $35 with \u03c3=$3B, 50% chance for a markup over last valuation with a markup size of 15% with \u03c3=3.5%, and finally an IPO pop/drop over the prior price of +15% with \u03c3=15% (so 16% chance of a first-day drop). After removing the 17% for no IPO, that gives 0/10/40/26/6(/17). On its face this distribution seems reasonable, but I'll adjust if anything comes up to suggest changing it."], [1333, "2021-04-25T15:24:59Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.16, 0.35, 0.26, 0.2], ""], [14266, "2021-04-25T07:20:02Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.35, 0.35, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [98893, "2021-04-24T15:26:24Z", [0.01, 0.03, 0.21, 0.39, 0.33, 0.03], "Stocks are crazy"], [54663, "2021-04-24T14:59:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [99484, "2021-04-24T13:12:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.43, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [100767, "2021-04-23T16:32:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [97185, "2021-04-23T14:46:27Z", [0.03, 0.34, 0.23, 0.11, 0.25, 0.04], ""], [37379, "2021-04-23T01:41:38Z", [0.04, 0.15, 0.41, 0.35, 0.02, 0.03], "Spreading out probabilities to account for the extreme overvaluation of stocks in general and wondering when rational valuations might return."], [24849, "2021-04-22T17:45:51Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [24849, "2021-04-22T17:44:21Z", [0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100750, "2021-04-22T15:24:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-04-22T13:31:02Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.35, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [24139, "2021-04-20T23:44:18Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.35, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [49359, "2021-04-20T22:45:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], "Robinhood is currently valued at $40 billion but could go higher, depending on investors holding their tongues the right way ...\n"], [26642, "2021-04-20T14:38:28Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.55, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-04-19T13:44:28Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.39, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [86031, "2021-04-19T03:46:52Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [24139, "2021-04-19T00:44:12Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [100612, "2021-04-17T21:42:01Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2], ""], [100602, "2021-04-17T20:31:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [86367, "2021-04-17T16:39:07Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.39, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [98893, "2021-04-17T14:48:59Z", [0.03, 0.04, 0.1, 0.3, 0.42, 0.11], "Looking good, but you never know"], [1333, "2021-04-17T13:10:56Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.17, 0.25, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [98081, "2021-04-16T20:35:03Z", [0.03, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.32, 0.05], "Current media opinion appears to be saying that RH likely to be valued at around 40bn or 50bn.
