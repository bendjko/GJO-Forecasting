I'll revise my initial estimate as evidence becomes available. From the Saudi side, Prince Salman is the heir apparent and a likely guy to be asked to arrange such a meeting. However, Salman is the Minister of Defense and that the Saudi Ministry of Defense is accused by Iran of deliberately accused of bombing the Iranian Embassy in Yemen:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35251917\nSo it's unlikely Salman would broker such a meeting.

He even referred to Saudis as Iran's \"brothers.\" Things didn't turn out quite as Rouhani had hoped. \"Middle Eastern geopolitics have changed dramatically since the mid-1990s, when Rouhani had helped engineer a Saudi-Iran rapprochement.  . . . Rouhani appointed Admiral Ali Shamkhani as the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council -- Iran's equivalent of national security advisor. Shamkhani, who is ethnically Arab, received Saudi Arabia's highest medal in 2004, the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud, for his efforts to improve relations with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The thinking appears to have been -- at least in part -- that Shamkhani was the best suited official to orchestrate Iranian outreach to Saudi.\n. . .  \nFurthermore, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif declared his willingness to travel to Riyadh but didn't receive an invitation until King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud died in January 2015. Zarif attended the king's funeral but no Saudi official agreed to meet with him during his visit. Months earlier, Zarif did have a brief sit-down with the then-foreign minister in New York, the late Prince Saud al-Faisal, but in retrospect it is clear that very little was achieved. \"Part of Iran's problem in dealing with Saudi Arabia is Riyadh's inherent sense of insecurity, rooted in its dependence on the U.S. and the outsourcing of its security to Washington. \n. . . \nWhile expectations on what the Syria talks can achieve must be tempered, the fact that all key outside players are at the table is an important achievement in and of itself. Neither the execution of a Shia cleric nor the sacking of an embassy -- however unacceptable -- can be permitted to scuttle the fragile Syria talks.\n. . .\n\" . . . the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council must pressure both sides to deescalate and, if possible, explore opportunities to mediate the conflict. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Iran and Saudi Arabia later this month. Mindful of the strong relations China enjoys with both of these Persian Gulf powerhouses and mindful of China's own interest in stability in the region, Beijing may be able to play a helpful role in defusing tensions.\n. . . \nFriends of Saudi Arabia need to intervene once more and convince Riyadh of the inevitable: Iran is part of the region; it is a major power and long-term stability necessitates its inclusion in any security order. The influence and privilege Saudi Arabia enjoyed under American order will no longer be the same -- because that order is no more.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Most of the time when I think a question is a no-brainer, it turns out that I'm the one with no brain, not the person(s) who drafted the question.

During his reign, Saudi Arabia has led a coalition fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen and staunchly opposed regional Shiite power Iran, even as Tehran struck a nuclear deal with world powers.\n...\nThe disruption in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran may have implications for peace efforts in Syria. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and others spent significant time trying to bring the countries to the negotiating table and they both sat together at talks aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to the civil war.\" The article goes on to mention widespread protests in the region including Bahrain, Turkey, India, and Pakistan not to mention complicating relations with Iraq where there are calls to scrap the formal re-opening of the Saudi Embassy which has been closed there for 25 years. Will players in Syria be able to look past this and continue to focus on the threat ISIS remains to be in the region? Might this cause a flare up in the house of Saud?

I see that as having potential to either boost moderates within Iran, or to (deliberately) unleash some form of backlash from conservatives there (possibly to Saudi's strategic advantage), and King Salman seems like the sort of person who likes to roll that sort of dice. 2a. Saudi and Iran have played nice-ish re:oil prices and production. Prices have spiraled to such a degree that might engender high level meetings as Saudi's purse strings get tighter. 2b.

Both are relatively new to their respective offices. I am marking this as a relatively low probability for the following reasons: 1) The Saudis have been instrumental in the present low price of oil.  Along with sanctions by other Western governments, this has hurt the Iranian economy, and the Iranian's understand this probably wasn't a mere business decision. 2) The Iranians have an active nuclear weapons program.  _If_ they get a nuclear weapon, the Saudis fear there will be no stopping Iranian aspirations in the Middle East.  Because of the Saudis relationship to and financing of the Pakistani nuclear program, they will probably acquire their own nuclear weapons shortly after a successful Iranian test.  There were reports that the Saudis told the Obama Administration that Iran's nuclear installations should be immediately attacked.  Obviously, this didn't happen.  But if _I_ could find articles about it, so could the Iranian intelligence service. 3) Both governments are concerned with ISIS.  While a relatively small thing now, it has the potential to become a Very Big Thing quickly.  The Saudis are building a 600 mile fence to keep ISIS out of the Kingdom.  OTOH, would anyone be particularly surprised if there were a deal between ISIS and Iran to divide Iraq between themselves?  There have been complaints (for years) that Iran has actively engaged, and through proxies, to destabilize Iraq.  BTW, where is the Mahdi Army in all the action? 4) The on-going conflict in Yemen is a fight between an Iranian proxy and Saudi Arabia.  The Saudis may have to treat with Iran to disengage, but it is too early for that. 5) History is against a meeting, because there is long standing bad feelings between these two countries.  Here's an interesting article about recent history (especially if you like spy stories): http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136917/matthew-kroenig/time-to-attack-iran \"In early October, U.S. officials accused Iranian operatives of planning to assassinate Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the United States on American soil. Iran denied the charges, but the episode has already managed to increase tensions between Washington and Tehran. Although the Obama administration has not publicly threatened to retaliate with military force, the allegations have underscored the real and growing risk that the two sides could go to war sometime soon -- particularly over Iran\u2019s advancing nuclear program.\" Reasons why a meeting could take place. 1) Russia has entered the Middle East to defend its interests in Syria.  They are filling a void left by the United States.  Saudi Arabia may try to negotiate deals separately from the US. 2) The Saudis may need to buy time to get their own nuclear weapon.
