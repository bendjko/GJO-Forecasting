If the summary executions of drug users and dealers continues, then I assess a 75% chance of an armed group from the Philippines will engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more civilians. \nMoreover, although the battle of Marawi City in Mindanao is over, ISIS-P and the loyal Abu Sayyaf Group  (ASG) maintain a presence in the region as evidenced by the 27 January 2019 double bombing of Cathedrals in city of Jolo killing 20 civilians2 . Additionally, on 1 August 2018, a suicide bomber linked to ASG killed 11 civilians in Basilan using a vehicle borne improvised explosive device at a military check point3 . \nWhile, the bombings consist of 31 casualties within a 6 month time frame and also, represent the two largest attacks during that period, the bombings were perpetrated by one group. Terrorism in Mindanao extends to additional groups such as (the largest): the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), and the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, New People\u2019s Army (NPA). These groups all operate in and out of the Mindanao region, and all largely use improvised explosive devices as their primary tactic to engage in terrorism. \nI judge, the death tolls of terrorism and the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d is highly likely to reach 1,000 or more within the given time frame.  1.\thttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/19/dutertes-philippines-drug-war-death-toll-rises-above-5000 2.\thttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47018747 3.\thttps://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/08/01/1838698/basilan-car-bomb-kills-11\n"], [172, "2019-02-12T01:00:10Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2019-02-11T13:09:08Z", [0.05], ""], [48709, "2019-02-08T16:47:27Z", [0.02], "A Tsunami Is more likely to kill more people is my thinking \ud83e\udd14 "], [691, "2019-02-08T16:08:40Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-02-05T13:06:35Z", [0.05], ""], [12591, "2019-02-03T19:41:28Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2019-02-01T16:53:20Z", [0.05], ""], [60061, "2019-02-01T01:58:44Z", [0.03], ""], [172, "2019-01-31T02:10:40Z", [0.02], ""], [67077, "2019-01-29T19:31:01Z", [0.07], ""], [691, "2019-01-27T12:18:35Z", [0.07], ""], [54996, "2019-01-26T11:35:07Z", [0.25], ""], [62808, "2019-01-23T14:08:27Z", [0.25], ""], [1333, "2019-01-22T16:55:33Z", [0.03], ""], [172, "2019-01-22T00:33:15Z", [0.02], "Peace seems to be breaking out at least in Mindanao.
