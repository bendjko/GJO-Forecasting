Under Supreme court case law information doesn't have to be excluded if it was according to the law, even if the law was found later to be unconstitutional.  In other words,  the Supreme Court could reverse, and carpenter still go to jail.  BTW case law is absolutely clear:  the law as written is on the side of the US.  The supreme court is debating carving out an exception.  But if so.. where?\nAnd if they do -what does this say about the Patriot act??? At the heart of the matter is that in the digital age we 'voluntarily' (does anyone read those disclosure forms we sign) give away information to third parties.   Facebook.  Mobile Companies.  Apps of all colors and sizes.  The Government can seize that information by requesting it from those companies.   The courts reasoning previously was that if you voluntarily gave someone information - you don't have an expectation of privacy.  So.  The court clearly needs to do something about the Miller and Smith rulings.  The only real question is - can they carve out an exception, and will they do so in time.  This case was argued in November - the fact that they hve not issued an opinion yet speaks to the huge scope of this issue and the size of the problem.  Problems with the wording: 1.  Is the question (really) will his conviction be overturned?\n2.  Is the question - was the previous action be found unconstitutional\n3.  Or will the Justices find that while the action was done correctly, under previous law, the standard is now to be changed. \n4.  Will they do it in time?  So,  I believe 1.  They will find the previous actions were done in accordance with the law. \n2.  They will enumerate a new law regarding third party disclosures. \n3.  I think the court will eventually uphold his conviction. \n4.  I think a decision will happen in this term.  But I have time to change if it gets closer to the end of term. http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/11/argument-preview-justices-return-cellphones-fourth-amendment/\nhttp://www.scotusblog.com/2017/08/symposium-carpenter-eyewitness-rule/"], [23006, "2018-04-26T03:55:06Z", [0.9], ""], [2965, "2018-04-26T01:14:43Z", [0.87], "warrantless and subpoena less"], [691, "2018-04-26T01:02:10Z", [0.8], ""], [172, "2018-04-25T11:35:12Z", [0.75], ""], [15196, "2018-04-23T13:14:15Z", [0.6], ""], [172, "2018-04-21T03:07:03Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2018-04-19T14:23:12Z", [0.8], ""], [38612, "2018-04-18T09:13:53Z", [0.4], "Appeal Court ruled that warrantless use of the data is legal and there is Third party doctrine. however, whether the data is in privacy area is still controversial.\n"], [37512, "2018-04-17T00:27:56Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2018-04-16T16:31:15Z", [0.8], ""], [32258, "2018-04-14T20:07:34Z", [0.98], ""], [37488, "2018-04-13T23:45:34Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2018-04-09T12:15:31Z", [0.8], ""], [36910, "2018-04-07T12:03:50Z", [0.15], ""], [57428, "2018-04-07T00:58:49Z", [0.25], "If the Court sees the data similar to the that found in a \u201cpen register,\u201d then the use of the records will likely be constitutional."], [56516, "2018-04-07T00:26:30Z", [0.25], ""], [45153, "2018-04-06T22:59:53Z", [0.05], ""], [32258, "2018-04-06T16:33:34Z", [0.9], ""], [48309, "2018-04-05T22:37:37Z", [0.03], ""], [52250, "2018-04-05T11:33:54Z", [0.85], ""], [2965, "2018-04-02T20:27:19Z", [0.87], "I have come around to the view that\nthe Courts deem this FAQ consent to be invalid\nor you would have to waive your 4th and 5th a rights\neverytime u use Edge or google or god forbid Facebook\nI think we have these votes Brier, Kennedy, Sotomayor Ginsburg Kagan\nJustice kennedy would be writing  both Carpenter and Gill\nI think same group plus Roberts tosses out Masterpiece non constitutional\nI think Husted is going Ohios way   "], [2965, "2018-04-01T23:50:27Z", [0.73], ""], [57427, "2018-04-01T17:12:30Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2018-04-01T17:05:30Z", [0.8], ""], [53863, "2018-04-01T03:10:32Z", [0.1], ""], [593, "2018-03-31T15:39:00Z", [0.5], ""], [57336, "2018-03-30T20:12:00Z", [0.25], ""], [804, "2018-03-29T17:32:19Z", [0.15], ""], [16778, "2018-03-28T16:58:07Z", [0.1], "Re-iterating my prediction.

The Government's position was that they did obtain a Court Order, which is allowed in the Stored Communication Act (boy-oh-boy, Congress needs to do something about that SCA law because it is clearly obsolete). Justice Kennedy: would not see the difference between 1 day or 127 days as relevant, and that there was court supervision over law enforcement provided by the SCA when law enforcement obtained a Court Order to subpoena the cell phone towers' data.  It is unclear that Justice Kennedy would agree that the data should be used as part of the prosecution or not. He may incline to see data used to narrow down the field of suspects, but not as evidence by itself to convict.  Justice Alito & Gorsuch: they are on the property right angle. If they found that Carpenter has property right to his cell phone location record (likely they would), then the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and supersedes SCA. Justice Kennedy may not agree on this though. He wondered why Congress provides both means: a Court Order and a Warrant, so if Warrant is always required then is there a use for a Court Order. Justice Kagan and Sotomayor: they are afraid and very afraid of the precision of the technology. If placing a GPS on a car without a warrant is unconstitutional, then using cellphone location data would be unconstitutional as well, since its tracking ability has improved and will continue to improve. Without mentioning it, but clearly in the mind of the Justices, Amazon and Google's ability, with Alexa-like devices, would be able to record conversations in bedrooms, where the consumers expect total privacy.

That last part is what makes 702 so special: it attempts to regulate the collection and processing of foreign intelligence when it is on U.S. infrastructure, so that we can fully attempt to protect U.S. persons\u2019 privacy. That is all the authority does, no more no less. But while the explanation of what the law is intended to do may appear simple, with no implications for American civil liberties, in practice separating the communications of legitimate foreign intelligence targets from U.S. persons is difficult and incidental collection occurs \u2013 leading some to cry foul. Incidental collection is probably one of the most misunderstood terms on the planet. To many people when they hear the term, it conjures up the idea that when you are intending to collect one communication, you somehow got a second, another. That is not what it means. What it means is that because every communication has at least two ends, if you are focused on one end of that then you are necessarily going to incidentally collect both ends. And that communication is therefore thought to be the property of two or more people. That second person is the incidental collection. Some have demanded that the NSA immediately remove and report all incidentally collected communications belonging to a U.S. person, but doing so has its challenges\nMost of the time you have no idea who that second person is, as you are targeting the person of interest. You really don\u2019t know his or her status until you look at the communication, and even then, it is very seldom that you know what his or her citizenship is or what their proclivities are. In order to understand that, you have to spend some time and attention thinking about them. That is the conundrum here. When asked, does the intelligence community know how many times they incidentally collect a U.S. person, the general answer is no, because in order to know that, you would have to focus attention on that second person \u2013 in many cases, with no just cause. They have not done anything to deserve the attention of the U.S. intelligence community. To minimize the possibility of picking up the inadvertent collection of U.S. person communications, the NSA decided in May that it would end what is known as \u201cabout\u201d collection. Currently, the decision is merely a policy choice on the part of the NSA, but some have suggested that the change should be codified in a reauthorized FISA 702 bill. But what is \u201cabout\u201d collection and should it be codified?\"\nEnd Inglis Are these 4th amendment problems or statutory problems?.\nThese are real 4th a problems as  even warrants cannot be applied to prohibited \" general searches\" absolutely prohibited by express terms of 4th amendment.\nSee express terms of 4th amendment these general searches are absolutely prohibited even WITH a warrant.\n\"And no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized\" \nQuery \nhow could even  a warrant support a 187 day search\nit may just be that they require a warrant\n but a warrant would be violated by the search and seizure Many layers-3d party doctrine a fiction I am going to take another look  @JMR2017\nSeems like law needs to rein in technology\nif it continues-there will be no privacy\nIt may require comprehensive privacy regulation\nlike the EU\nso how did we end up less free in US than Eu"], [42162, "2017-12-08T00:38:27Z", [0.9], "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Jones_(2012)\nhttps://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1259 As pointed out by at least @JMR2017, United States v. Jones is illuminating. It was a similar question, and the Court had the same composition as today with the exception of Justice Gorsuch who has replaced Justice Scalia since then. Alito, Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor thought back then that obtaining location information over a long period of time requires a warrant based on reasonable expectation of privacy. However, it's important to note that the Chief Justice, Kennedy, and Thomas didn't necessarily disagree with that view. From page 11 of the majority opinion (https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1259.pdf): \"It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question.\" (Also quoted in the Wikipedia article.) The government's reasoning is basically that the location information in this case wasn't obtained in a search by government agents, it was third party information from the cell service company. They say that so far, third party information has been obtainable by subpoena even though it may reveal aspects about the subject's private life. The government also says that in the current scheme of things, there is a degree of protection w/r/t cell site information since a court order is required. But the government's attorney had a hard time in oral argument. It seems to me that a strong majority of the Court will view that location data over a long period of time is something that requires a warrant\u2014whether it be obtained by planting a GPS device (Jones case) or by obtaining records from a cell service company (current case). Also, the fact that the same result could be achieved without a warrant by \"tailing\" a suspect 24/7 is a false analogy because his location _in the past_ can't be revealed even in that manner.

I think it's possible to get more than a majority of Justices to require a warrant. I base this on how they voted in Jones but the difference here is the third party doctrine operating in this case as opposed to (Jones) the government attaching the GPS device on the property of the defendant (his car).  In this case,  can the government simply hide behind the curtain in the name of the 3rd party doctrine? What's at issue is a person's reasonable expectation of privacy even though here, we are talking about a person voluntarily carrying the surveillance device (their phones) on their own person. I don't think people have a choice in this digital age to not be tracked but how much and for how long seems to be the issue. Even if you turn off \"location\" on your smart phone, you can be tracked when you make a call or check your email, or open an app. Location can be tracked more precisely in an urban setting where there are numerous cell towers.  So what's a reasonable expectation of privacy?

The village snoop had a fallible memory and didn't follow people for 127 days. The electronic information is infallible. You can follow them forever. That's a big change. So, I agree that that change is there. It's there in many aspects of life, not just location. Now, on the other side of it is that probably, I'm not sure, but probably police and FBI and others, when they get word of white collar crime, money laundering, drugs, financing terrorism, we can go through the list, large numbers of cases, of important criminal cases, they don't have probable cause. They do have reasonable ground to think. And they start with bank records, with all kinds of financial information, purchases. So, if I accept your line, there's no such thing in the law as location. There is, but, I mean, people immediately say and why? And then, when they say why, we're going to have to say something like: X days, at least arbitrary, but X days, are very personal. It was given under circumstances where they didn't know they were giving it or they certainly didn't consent to it. And that is basically the reason. Maybe we throw a few other things in there to get an exception from Miller. That will be taken immediately to the lower courts, and eventually here, and people will say: Well, what about financial information, i.e., credit card purchases where the most intimate credit card purchases, wherever they are, are immediately records, and what about -- and they'll think of five others -- I can only think of one or two, but, believe me, the legal profession and those interested in this understand it very well. So where are we going? Is this the right line? How do we, in fact, write it? Not, you see, for location. I have less trouble with that. But where is it going?

The SCA did not require the government to show probable cause or to obtain a warrant in order to obtain the data.\nIn April of 2011, police arrested four men in connection with a string of armed robberies of stores in and around Detroit, Michigan. The stores were Radio Shacks and T-Mobile stores. During police questioning, one of the suspects confessed that the group had committed robberies of nine stores in Michigan and Ohio over a four-month period from December of 2010 to March of 2011. During these robberies, the suspect informed police than an additional 15 men, alternating across robberies, served in various support capacities such as serving as police lookouts and as getaway drivers. The suspect forfeited his cell phone to FBI authorities, who examined the phone's call records for additional information. In May and June of 2011, the FBI applied for three different judicial orders in order to obtain transactional records for 16 different phone numbers gleaned from the suspect's phone. The evidence the FBI sought was for records that \"included '[a]ll subscriber information, toll records and call detail records including listed and unlisted numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted to and from [the] target telephones from December 1, 2010 to present[,]' as well as 'cell site information for the target telephones at call origination and at call termination for incoming and outgoing calls[.]'\" The orders were granted pursuant to the Stored Communications Act (hereafter, SCA).

They argue that this data has such significant implications for freedom of speech and association that it demands a warrant supported by probable cause, no less than private papers in a desk drawer. There are precedents affirming that we should have reasonable expectations of privacy in many cases where the information is in the possession of a 3rd party:\n-\tPatients can expect privacy of their diagnostic test results, even when the hospital maintains the records (Ferguson v. City of Charleston)\n-\tPassengers can expect privacy of their luggage placed in an overhead bin despite the possibility of external inspection by others (Bond v. United States)\n-\tHotel guests are entitled to constitutional protections even though they provide \u201cimplied or express permission\u201d for third parties to access their rooms (Stoner v.

Although Gorusch is conservative, and conservatives are more often seen as \"tough on crime\", it seems his originalist interpretation ends him up as being sympathetic to the rights of the defenders in Fourth Amendment cases. [1] United States vs. Jones seems to be a popular citation in the forecasts. Putting a GPS onto someone's private property (car) to track them is one thing, but the collection of phone data from a cell provider under SCA seems valid. The information was clearly pertinent to the criminal case, the main consideration for being able to use the SCA: ...\u201cspecific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that records at issue \u201care relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation\u201d; the government does not need to show that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. [2] In addition, cell phone contracts in the modern era almost certainly require you to voluntarily give up cell tower usage/location as part of the phone contract, what with all the fine print. I can't think that the court will be able to take the defendant's claim seriously, that he did not voluntarily give up his cell tower communications away to a third party. Regardless of how one feels about the need to delineate between what scope of information being seized by government/investigative agents (I think there is a valid concern that privacy in the modern era can be easily eroded), I don't think the judges will be able to rule in favor of the defendant given existing laws.
