The inside view suggests looking at the ongoing investigation into the fatal Uber crash and to estimate possible other incidents. Uber crash:\n- As others here have noted, the county attorney decided not to file criminal charges against Uber.\n- As others here have also noted, the backup driver may still face criminal charges. I'm not sure how to evaluate whether that will happen. Apparently, she could be charged for \"vehicular manslaughter, according to a police report in June\". [1] The law dictionary defines that as \"the crime of causing the death of a human being due to illegal driving of an automobile, including gross negligence, drunk driving, reckless driving or speeding\". [2] Examining gross negligence a bit more: \"Gross negligence is the extreme indifference to or reckless disregard for the safety of others. Gross negligence is more than simple carelessness or failure to act. It is willful behavior done with extreme disregard for the health and safety of others. [...] While most car accidents involve ordinary negligence such as careless driving, an injury accident caused by a drunk driver may in some cases be considered an act of gross negligence, depending on the circumstances.\" [3] The evidence seems to point to gross negligence for me, but I should note that the backup driver claims to have paid attention. [4] Filing charges also does not require proving gross negligence, but just asserting gross negligence. Unfortunately, I'm not a law professional and find this hard to judge for that reason. I also don't know that much about the incentives of the relevant stakeholders here. It's noteworthy that the accident happened almost a year ago and she still has not been charged. I'd estimate the probability that she will be charged before the end of the year at 65%. Other crashes:\n- In another context, I estimated 70% for at least one fatal accident before the end of the ear. I'm not sure if nonfatal crashes could result in criminal charges though.\n- In the Uber case, it took the prosecutors 8 to 9 months to come to a decision whether to prosecute.\n- Charging the firm seems less likely than charging the driver given the Uber incident. Both seem very unlikely given the timeline of the Uber case. I'd estimate 10% of charging the firm conditional on another accident and 20% of charging the driver conditional on another accident. This gives 7% for the firm and 14% for the backup driver. Putting that all together, we get 70% for a backup driver, 7% for a firm. This gives 65% for a driver alone, 2% for a firm alone, 5% for both, and 28% for neither. This is most likely to change if somebody with more legal background has a convincing take on the Uber case.
