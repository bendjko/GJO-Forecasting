According to the report, 2,198,774 individuals lost their vehicle registrations, gun licenses, driver's licenses and professional IDs last year, while 106,740 guns were recorded as either lost or stolen. News of the huge number of missing weapons comes amid concerns over the reported proliferation of unlicensed guns, including through online sales, and has reignited debate on weapons that were reported missing from military and police armories in the wake of the coup attempt. In its 2014 report, the Interior Ministry had put the number of lost or stolen guns at 14,682, while the number of lost or stolen license plates stood at only 3,037. In its 2015 report, the number of lost or stolen guns increased more than 500% to 91,120, while the number of lost or stolen license plates hit 703,749. In the report for 2016, the year of the coup attempt, lost or stolen guns further increased, to 107,628, while lost or stolen license plates shot up to 900,383. During the night of the attempted putsch, civilians who took to the streets to stop the putschists seized some soldiers' weapons, while some soldiers surrendered and voluntarily handed them over. Meanwhile, there have also been reports that weapons were distributed to civilians from police warehouses.\n -- https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/turkey-mystery-lingers-over-missing-weapons.html"], [172, "2018-03-17T02:16:55Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2018-03-16T21:55:30Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-15T19:31:27Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-03-15T07:09:45Z", [0.0], ""], [54315, "2018-03-15T04:30:17Z", [0.8], ""], [368, "2018-03-15T01:25:43Z", [0.0], ""], [55099, "2018-03-14T18:07:26Z", [0.0], ""], [51503, "2018-03-14T12:09:39Z", [0.25], "A thousand Kurds and Christians maybe."], [691, "2018-03-14T11:20:31Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-03-14T06:22:46Z", [0.0], ""], [32258, "2018-03-14T02:10:10Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-13T21:35:10Z", [0.0], ""], [50509, "2018-03-13T20:01:55Z", [0.14], ""], [1034, "2018-03-13T06:35:19Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-03-13T01:11:32Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-12T21:19:26Z", [0.0], ""], [27320, "2018-03-12T19:55:46Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-03-12T18:17:42Z", [0.0], ""], [37053, "2018-03-12T17:10:16Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2018-03-11T21:10:44Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-03-11T20:51:41Z", [0.0], ""], [37379, "2018-03-11T02:10:31Z", [0.07], "Dateline 3-10-2018  2018 started as a fairly calm year for Turkey; reported fatality numbers were low and trends suggested they may continue falling.

Despite some moves towards a more totalitarian government, they are still a democracy and have to be conscious of the avoidance of civilian deaths not only to the international community, but towards their own people. Due to the number of conflicts they are currently involved in, there is a small chance that escalation with the PKK or other similar groups could lead towards a systematic targeting of Kurds, most likely just outside their borders in one of the conflict zones. The other population that could be potentially targeted would be Syrians, most likely during an incursion into a bordering Syrian town in an effort to achieve their military or political goals. The 1% chance I've assigned is due to these conflicts, but Turkey would have a lot to lose by undertaking such a campaign and there is not much to gain.
