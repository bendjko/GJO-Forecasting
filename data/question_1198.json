Yes, this could be sort of a tease to an unexpected outcome, but lets realize she has a dragon and the Unsullied are on her side. The Stark family, including Jon may not be. Tyrion presumably is not. So for Dany to not be on the throne, someone else will have to overthrow her, but who will that someone be?  The presumptive answer is Jon, but how that happens, I'm simply not sure. Perhaps there is a popular uprising from the northmen, and the Stark family and they essentially will him to take the role, but the question of how Dany is defeated then remains. I don't see her giving up the Iron Throne willingly. Is the North going to defeat a dragon?  If it's not Jon then who? The only logical choice is Sansa, but how does this happen? It's the series finale so anything can happen. Maybe she leads a rebellion from the North, but with only 80 minutes to go?
