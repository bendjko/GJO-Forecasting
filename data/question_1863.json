As a result, I think my previous reasoning was likely incorrect, and I am vastly changing my forecast. According to The Atlantic, Justice Sotomayor as much as stated that the plaintiffs would win.  That is, the union would lose.  However, the issue is the rational.   The per se physical taking clause might cause a seismic shift in constitutional law in a wide variety of other areas.  Even the conservative justices discussed how inspections of nuclear power plant could be considered a per se taking if the per se taking argument were to prevail.  Kavanaugh said they could have prevailed easily using a less intrusive precedent from the 1950s.  Roberts and Kavanugh expressed strong support for finding a different rational to support the plaintiffs position.    Mitch McConnell seems to be trying to make the supreme court an issue in the mid-term elections.   I base this upon his statement that there will be no Democratic appointments if Republicans win in the mid-terms.   That puts pressure on Breyer to retire now when the Democrats have a one vote majority in the senate (VPHarris).   If Beyer did retire, this would create a monumental fight for his seat in the senate.   Also, the supreme court, whom I suspect communicates with McConnell, also just asked Biden for his position on a Harvard affirmative action case involving Asians claiming discrimination.  This is a no win situation for Biden.  It will alienate either Asian-  or African-Americans -- both of whom vote for democrats.    Thus, I feel very confident that the union will lose but likely for a different reason that the per se physical takings clause.    https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/cedar-point-scotus/618405/"], [1333, "2021-06-16T14:21:22Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2021-06-16T12:57:44Z", [0.67], ""], [94872, "2021-06-14T18:24:40Z", [0.55], ""], [691, "2021-06-14T15:15:16Z", [0.7], ""], [1333, "2021-06-14T13:34:36Z", [0.67], ""], [1333, "2021-06-12T13:56:08Z", [0.78], ""], [1333, "2021-06-10T14:41:39Z", [0.83], ""], [73050, "2021-06-09T21:33:35Z", [0.8], ""], [1333, "2021-06-07T13:16:43Z", [0.84], ""], [94872, "2021-06-06T01:12:30Z", [0.55], ""], [70711, "2021-06-05T19:36:59Z", [0.75], ""], [96828, "2021-06-05T05:50:52Z", [0.49], ""], [1333, "2021-06-04T19:46:19Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2021-06-04T14:23:15Z", [0.98], ""], [34959, "2021-06-04T04:27:29Z", [0.67], ""], [67232, "2021-06-03T21:13:05Z", [0.9], "There are really two issues here: Will the supreme court find a per se taking? and, Will the court exclude the union organizers from going on the property for any reason? The conservative majority will forbid the union organizers from going on the property based upon the oral argument summaries.   After oral arguments,  there are three strong votes for finding a per se  taking -- Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch -- and three strong votes for no per se  taking -- Kagan, Sotomayor and Breyer.  None of the remaining three justices seem to like the statute, but Kavanaugh and Barrett both seem to favor the per se taking argument.  Roberts disliked the harassment that might  occur under this statute that allows so much access to the property.   The statistics page of Scotus blog states that the Supreme Court overturned all nine Ninth Circuit cases before the court in the October 2020 term.  Thus, they will likely over-turn this ruling as well.  As stated above, the issue here is why.  Specifically, will the court's ruling be based on a per se taking.   Barrett voted 100 percent of the time with Gorsuch, who is a definite yes on per se taking and only 71 percent with Sotomayor, who is definite no on pro se taking.   Barrett is new.  There may be a \"law of small numbers\" issue.  Yet, she is likely a yes based upon an outside view as it exists right now.  Kavanaugh votes much more often with the conservatives on property issues.  Thus, he is likely a yes based on outside view.  Kavanaugh stated during oral arguments that a re-wording of the statue would  -- not could -- avoid the constitutional issue altogether and allow the union organizers to continue organizing on the company's property.    That is dicta since a re-wording is not before the court.   Kavanaugh voted in favor of upholding property rights in prior cases. Thus, this firms up the outside view in favor of a yes. Barrett and Kavanaugh in their lower court rulings have a history of voting in favor of property rights and in favor employers.  Therefore, i think there is a likelihood they will vote in favor of finding a per se taking.    Roberts will vote with the majority if Barrett and Kavanaugh vote in favor of the per se taking.

And in oral arguments itself, the Justices seemed to go back and forth defending and refuting the sides, which made it tricky to figure out which side each Justice was shooting for. As a final point, Gorsuch had once in oral argument made comments that made it almost clear that he supported one side but then made a 180 in the court's final decision. I can't remember what case that was but it may have been Bostock v. Clayton County (first to mind; availability heuristic lol).

After reading the oral arguments and doing some brief searching of past cases referenced, it sounds like current precedents typically limit per se physical taking to be a permanent occupation or any occupation that eliminates all economically beneficial uses. The plaintiffs want the court to expand the per se definition to apply to even short-term temporary occupations that didn't exist under common law (so government inspections for the purpose of health and safety would be exempt, since those existed in the early history of America), which I think would mean that any occupation via government regulation would require compensation (unless the form of occupation existed under common law). Alternatively, the California government argues that that would be too expansive and basically that it limits the ability to decide cases on an ad hoc basis, or a more case-by-case basis. In the government's position there are many scenarios where government has an interest in providing temporary access to property which should not be considered a taking when evaluating on a case-by-case basis. Both sides were questioned by the justices for the inability to specify a reasonable line to define where a per se taking happens. Barrett suggested the plaintiffs proposal was so expansive that it would deny union access rights established under the National Labor Relations Act and subsequent SCOTUS cases. The California government was criticized for not having a clear definition of how permanent an occupation would have to be to meet the per se standard. When questioned by Justice Kagaon on whether an occupation of 360 days instead of 365 days would qualify as a per se taking the government agreed it probably would, but didn't have a clear answer as to how you would draw the line for when it stopped being a per se taking. Both Sotomayor and Kavanaugh seemed inclined to say the law is unconstitutional under a previous SCOTUS ruling, Babcock. That one allowed for narrower access of union organizers under certain conditions, such as if employees were inaccessible at other locations, such as their residences or other public spaces. Here's sort of my perception of the justices right now: Roberts: Unclear\nThomas: Likely per se\nBreyer: Very unlikely per se\nAlito: Probably per se\nSotomayor: Unlikely per se\nKagan: Unclear\nGorsuch: Likely per se\nKavanaugh: Unlikely per se\nBarrett: Unclear So I'm currently guessing 3 going in favor of it being a per se taking, 3 not considering it a per se taking, and 3 unclear. However, the justices that seemed unclear on it are Roberts, Kagan, and Barrett. If we just look at their conservative-liberal leanings that would imply 5-4 in favor of it being a per se taking, but really I think Roberts can't be analyzed on those lines. He seems inclined to go with narrower rulings when possible, and I would suspect he might be hesitant to create a new precedent that would strike down a potentially wide variety of regulations as unconstitutional. I think there's a good chance that the approach of Kavanaugh and Sotomayor is appealing to the justices who seem more on the fence, where they would strike down the law (or just rule that compensation is required) on the grounds of the previous Babcock case. Basically the question is where to draw the line, and it doesn't sound like the justices found either side convincing on the issue, so I'm inclined to think they would try to avoid drawing that line. I don't feel very confident in much of the above, but based on my impression here I'm going down 15 and saying it's a hair more likely that the California regulation is not ruled as a per se physical taking.

However, I think the liberals and perhaps Roberts and Gorsuch will not agree this is a per se taking, because doing so could invalidate a broad swath of other regulations that permit inspections, etc."], [92079, "2020-12-14T01:14:20Z", [0.79], "Salon The Supreme Court poised to overrule farmworker union rights\nLegal observers worry a ruling against a California law could signal a willingness to undermine labor codes By DAVID BACON\nNOVEMBER 27, 2020 4:52PM (UTC) \"Not long before Donald Trump's election in 2016, the Pacific Legal Foundation filed suit against California's farmworker access rule in federal court on behalf of two companies \u2014 Cedar Point Nursery in Siskiyou County and the Fowler Packing Company in Fresno.  The foundation is a conservative libertarian group that holds property rights sacred and campaigns against racial equity. It fought hard for the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to the high court. Had the political atmosphere in the country not changed in the 40 years since the regulation has been in effect, the suit might never have been filed at all. Agribusiness challenged the access rule from its inception and went all the way to the California Supreme Court, where the growers lost in 1976. In the last decade, however, visions of a liberal U.S. Supreme Court evaporated in the final years of the Obama administration, and Trump's election led to the appointment of three right-wing justices, giving the court a 6-3 conservative majority. When the U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Nov. 13 to hear the growers' appeal from their loss at the U.S. Court of Appeals, many legal observers became concerned. \"State court decisions over state issues used to be respected by the U.S. Supreme Court,\" says Jerry Cohen, who helped write the law as the legal director for the UFW. \"States' rights used to be a Republican issue.
