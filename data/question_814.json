(i) There are 2 men and 1 woman in alpine skiing (slalom and giant slalom). They seem to have no track record of winning anything, even in much smaller championships. Since there will be over 300 competitors from other countries and only 10 events [2], I'm willing to say NK has 0% chance of winning any medals in alpine skiing. (ii) In cross-country skiing there are 2 men (15km freestyle) and 1 woman (10km freestyle). They also seem to have come dead last, or near dead last, in 80+-person races in Russia last April. So I will say also 0% chance of medal for them, since there are 300+ competitors [3]. (iii) In short-track speed skating, NK is sending 2 men, but each will only compete in only one event --- Jong Kwang Bom in the 1500m and Choe Un Song in the 500m [1,4]. The latter athlete historically has times that would place him 20th or worse [5], so I'll call his chances of medalling 0%. I can't find any historical data for the former, and he is only 16 [6], so that suggests he has never competed outside NK. I give him 0% chance as well. (iv) In women's hockey we have the strange situation of the unified team. If this team does win a medal, how will the question resolve? Since each athlete gets a medal, I suppose technically a NK athlete will have won a medal, so I'll assume such medals will count for the question. I don't think this matters much though. The SK team is far from being a top team --- in the world championships they have always been division IIA or worse, and only qualified for division IB this year [7]. To be clear, the divisions are: top, IA, IB, IIA, IIB, etc. Each year the 1st-ranked team in each division is promoted to the next division up, and the bottom team is demoted to the next one down. So roughly speaking SK is \"worse\" than all of the top, IA, and IB divisions, or 8+6+5 = 19 teams. And indeed these divisions correlate strongly with Olympic medalling: only 6 nations have ever won medals in women's ice hockey (Canada, Finland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, USA) [8], and these have ALWAYS been in the top division, with the exception of Switzerland, which twice was demoted to division I but very soon got back to the top division. Now 12 NK players are joining the SK team, making their team have 35 players, but with only 22 being allowed at each game. Moreover, at every game 3 NK players must be among the 22 [1]. I'm pretty sure introducing strangers into any team, no matter how good, is very disruptive to the team. (And NK is worse than SK.) One might speculate that if the NK players were kept on the bench at all times that might not have a big effect; but that seems politically unviable to me. Plus, the Korean team is in a bracket that is already disfavored, where only the top two out of four teams go ahead to the quarter-finals [9]. On the other hand, there are only 8 teams, and half a dozen games (not all of which have to be won) between them and a medal. So I don't feel like the chance is 0%. I'll give it 5%. (v) Finally, in figure skating, NK is only entering the pairs event [10]. The most recent benchmark we can look at is how the NK pair placed in the Helsinki tournament in 2017 [11]. They came in 15th, and of the pairs that beat them, I can spot at least 10 in Pyeongchang [12], with possibly more to come from China and Russia. Let us generously assume that NK has a 50/50 chance of beating any of those 10 pairs. In order to medal, they would need to beat at least 8 of them. The odds of that are: 0.5^10 + (10 choose 1)*0.5^10 + (10 choose 2)*0.5^10 ~ 5%. But they don't have a uniform 50/50 chance of beating any of these pairs; for instance the competitors from Russia and China are on a whole other level. Plus looking at these 10 pairs doesn't take into account all the others. So I bring these odds down to 2%. Final fore cast: 7% chance of medal, 93% chance of going but no medal.

This plan is expected to be approved by the IOOC on Sunday.   I've been trying to figure out if this significantly impacts the chance that DPRK athletes will win a medal.  I've read that:\n-it is a sport only marginally popular in South Korea\n-in a recent DPRK-ROK game, ROK won 3-0\n-The move to field a joint hockey team has created uncertainty for the South Korean team, which has trained as a core group over the last four years and already is something of a hybrid because the Korean Ice Hockey Association recruited a handful of women\u2019s hockey players of Korean heritage from the United States and Canada. With their counterparts from South Korea, the women have established a familial bond while pushing to earn a reputation as a strong team, not just as one gifted a berth into their first Olympic appearance as the host nation.\n-Among the greatest unknown is who from the North will be joining their team. . .  . the North and South Korean players hardly got to know one another.\n-the South Korean team regularly lost games by 20 or more goals but has improved and eventually won a second-division world championship tournament in April. \n-with just over three weeks before the team\u2019s first game in the Olympics, against Switzerland on Feb. 10,  the players must figure out how to incorporate new teammates into their style of play, without disrupting chemistry. Bottomline for me is that I don't think that this team will have a chance of medaling, so I'm not changing my forecast. ALSO, the North Korean skaters  pair Tae Won Hyuk-Lee Ji Hyang is ranked 83rd. \"The reason for their low ranking, apart from their actual skill, can be attributed to their participation in only one international competition sponsored by the ISU in the last three years.\" http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2009/02/12/figure-skating-in-the-dprk/.

Medal likelihood seems nil given the world ranking of the DPRK pairs team relative to other pairs competing at the games, and the relatively fewer opportunities for surprises/upsets in pairs figure skating, i.e. if the sport were short track speed skating, where entire heats of skaters may fall or be disqualified, the odds of a freak accident leading to a DPRK medal are more likely than the number of accidents/mistakes that would have to occur to allow a pairs figure skating team to be elevated in the same way.

But few athletes may have a more impactful presence next month at the Games . . .  after North Korea announced Tuesday that it would participate in the Games. The pairs team, which finished 15th at the world skating championships last year .  . .  are the only North Koreans who have qualified for the 2018 Games. They are the lone elite, world-class winter athletes from the isolated nation, which has only won two medals at the Winter Games, a silver and bronze in speedskating, the last coming in 1992, and they have plenty of admirers among figure skating\u2019s cognoscenti. \u201cThey are so charismatic; I know the crowd would fall for them with their smile and passion and love of skating,\u201d Bruno Marcotte, a prominent Canadian pairs coach who worked with the skaters last summer in Montreal and during an Olympic qualifying competition in Germany in September, said by phone on Tuesday. \u201cI feel they\u2019ll be a crowd favorite.\u201d\n. . . \n. . . on various fields of play, the two countries have been on convivial terms lately. Last year, North Korea sent its women\u2019s national hockey team to play in South Korea, and South Korea sent its women\u2019s soccer team to play in North Korea. North Korea also sent a taekwondo team to the South. The two nations marched together in the opening ceremony at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. South Korean officials have held open that possibility for the Winter Games.\n. . . \nNorth Korea missed a deadline in late October to officially enter its pairs team into the Olympics. And it does not yet appear to have made such a request, Alexander Lakernik, a Russian who is vice president of the International Skating Union, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. But adding the North Koreans to the Olympic pairs competition would be a simple procedure. And the I.O.C. has said it would keep the doors open to North Korea\u2019s participation for as long as possible. The Olympic committee has also broached the idea of offering North Korea wild-card entries in some Nordic skiing sports and short-track speedskating. Discussions have been underway about the pairs team, Mr. Lakernik said, and given the special circumstances, \u201cthere could be an exception made; but first we need an application.\u201d While North Korea has won 16 gold medals in the Summer Games, in such sports as weight lifting, wrestling and boxing, it is not a power in the more expensive winter sports. North Korea did not participate in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. Its officials have recently complained that tightened sanctions against the country have made it difficult to obtain some sports equipment. In general, North Korea has not appeared to follow the model of the former Soviet Union and East Germany, which were both winter sports powers and used gold medals for propaganda purposes. But experts see participation in these Games as an attempt by Mr. Kim to get sanctions eased and to reduce the chances of American military action. \u201cSports diplomacy is a sexy affair,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \u201cPyongyang has all the reason to jazz up the Winter Olympiad and be the center of attention.\u201d Purely in skating terms, Mr. Marcotte, the coach said, the North Koreans appear to be mirroring the Chinese model of attempting to build pairs teams to an elite international level. At the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, Chinese pairs won two of the three available medals and are among the favorites to win gold at the 2018 Games. Ryom and Kim possess some of the dynamism seen in Chinese pairs and also some of the classic, balletic style of Russian skaters. There is Western influence in their routines as well. They perform their short program to an instrumental version of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cA Day in the Life.\u201d While qualifying for the 2018 Games at a competition in Germany in September, the skaters spoke several times with reporters and seemed relatively open. Both Ryom and Kim are listed as students. Both live in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, where loyalists to the Kim Jong-un regime are permitted to reside. \u201cI want to continue to improve until I become world champion,\u201d Ryom said at the time. One subject was off limits: the Olympics, because no decision had yet been made about North Korea\u2019s participation. And there seemed to be every attempt to avoid politics. Neither skater, for instance, wore pins commonly worn by North Koreans that depict Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un\u2019s grandfather and father, who preceded him as the country\u2019s dynastic rulers. And both skaters neglected to praise Kim Jong-un for their success, another common practice for North Korean athletes. Mr. Marcotte, the coach, said that all his interactions with the skaters had been about \u201csports, sports, sports.\u201d And while their performance at the Olympics would carry broader meaning for many, he said, the skaters would most likely feel only the pressure that every skater feels \u2014 to perform at their best. \u201cThey want to show the world that they\u2019re a good team,\u201d Mr. Marcotte said."], [25141, "2018-01-10T07:13:36Z", [0.04, 0.95, 0.01], ""], [46285, "2018-01-09T21:53:51Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0], ""], [47783, "2018-01-09T20:51:37Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [47818, "2018-01-09T20:38:32Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05], ""], [23879, "2018-01-09T19:57:29Z", [0.14, 0.86, 0.0], "Updating from 15/75/10 in view of the outcome of today's talks [1].

Base rates:\n\u2022\tI used the the number of Winter Olympics PRK could have participated as PRK (14 Winter games) and the number of medals it has achieved to win at the Winter Olympics (2 medals).\no\tAll things equal PRK has 14% chance (2/14=0,1428) of winning a medal at any Winter Olympic games.\n\u2022\tHowever I assume there to be a 5% chance of both PKR figure skaters or a hidden-gem bringing a medal to PKR\no\t1-0.04 (no participation)*0,05 = 0,048 \u2248 5%. Added probability thus of a medal would be 10%\n\u2022\tAverage of the two base rates would be 12%. Key Facts:\n\u2022\tNorth Korea and South Korea have held talks and allegedly have agreed that PKR will send official sports delegation to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang.\n\u2022\tPKR has in history won two medals from Winter Olypmics both from speed skating \u2013 silver in 1964 and bronze in 1992.\n\u2022\tPRK athlets are training in cross country skiing and ice skating categories (figure skating & speed skating).\nKey Assumptions:\n\u2022\tI assume the figure skaters that we know of which PRK is planning on sending to Olympics are unlikely to achieve a much better result they achieved at last world championships \u2013 15th. The likelihood of such a team winning a medal is 5%.\n\u2022\tI assume there is a likelihood of a \u201ehidden gem\u201c/wild card that could bring PRK a medal on a certain event \u2013 5% chance.\n\u2022\tI assume there still to be a chance that PRK will reverse its decision to not send a delegation to the Olympic games. Key Indicators:\n\u2022\tGood times/performance by PRK athlets at qualification rounds would increase the likelihood of PRK taking a medal from these Olympic games.\n\u2022\tPRK athlets mulling through qualification rounds or disqualifying in these rounds on diferent sports events. Decrease of the likelihood of PRK taking medals home from these Olympic games.\n\u2022\tEach week passing that nears to the opening ceremony will decrease the \u201eNo\u201c likelihood by 1%.

First, Kim Jong-Un has suggested quite clearly in his New Year's address that NK is willing to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics [2,3].  Since SK and everyone else had been bending over backwards to get them to come, they won't object. It comes down to what demands Kim Jong-Un makes. The crowd (158 forecasters as of this writing) has \"No\" at 47%, while professor Yang Moo-Jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul told AFP \"The chances of the North coming to the Olympics now seem to be more than 80 percent\" [2] . I have no idea how calibrated prof Yang is but he is an expert in the area. For now I will go in between the crowd and prof Yang and call \"No\" 30%. What about medaling? In [1] I counted NK participation in 69 WO events, with 2 medals, which gives 2/69 ~ 3% chance of medal per event. (And not 1.5% as I claimed in [1].)  Bump that up to 4% since Russia is out of these WO. NK only qualified for pairs figure skating but Lee Hee-Beom, the head of the Pyeongchang Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, said \"North Korea is likely to send athletes to figure skating, short track skating, cross country and women's ice hockey\". [2] Assuming that means athletes of both genders for SSS and CC, and both genders plus pair for FS, that would suggest participation in 8 events, giving 1 - (1 - 0.03)^8 ~ 22% chance of medal. But athletes not in FS didn't qualify, so they are worse than average, so bring that down by 2/3, 14%. Overall that means 70% x 14% ~ 10% chance of medal, leaving 60% chance of going but no medal.

On the yes/no front, it struck me that NK has apparently never said it would NOT go to the games. In contrast, when they did boycott the 1988 games, they announced those plans 8 months in advance [2]. In addition, there was news today of a rather strong signal from SK that it wants NK to participate, and some mildly favorable response from NK [3]. Based on these, I'm gonna go substantially below the crowd and call \"no\" a 60%. On the other hand, I did more precise calculations on probability of medals, by looking at number of Olympic events NK has participated in, rather than just number of Winter Olympics. From Wikipedia [4] one gathers that NK has participated in 69 events at the WO overall, and won 2 medals. This makes ~1.5% chance of medal per event. And in the 2018 WO they are qualified for only 1 event. But again, Russia is out, so bump that up to 2%. This makes chance of medal 0.4*0.02 ~ 1%, leaving 39% chance of participating but no medal.

North Korea has never boycotted the Winter Olympics [1] (it has only failed to qualify, on some occasions). It has boycotted the Summer Olympics twice [1] but in what feels like different times: in 1984 (in USA, when lots of communist countries boycotted), and in 1988 (in South Korea, when the IOC denied NK's request to co-host). For this question, we have (i) NK athletes already qualified; (ii) no large boycott from a bloc of countries; and (iii) no request to co-host from NK. These would all point to \"yes\". Another baserate-type argument for \"yes\" is the fact that NK routinely participates in sporting events in SK, e.g. the 2002 and 2014 Asian Games [2]. Pointing to \"no\" we have the current tensions in the peninsula, and the fact that NK has missed the deadline to accept the spots for which they have qualified --- by 49 days, as of this writing. Pointing back to \"yes\" we have the IOC signalling very hard that it wants NK in the Winter Olympics in spite of the missed deadline --- \u201cWe are still working to get North Korean athletes to participate \u2013 as you know two skaters are qualified but have missed the deadline,\u201d said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. \u201cBut we would of course be flexible if they expressed a desire to come\u201d [3]. I believe this means the window hasn't really closed, and won't really close until maybe the week before the event (early Feb), and moreover NK probably knows this, somewhat nullifying the deadline concerns above. Pointing back to \"no\" we have the crowd consensus here on GJOpen, which currently stands at 85% \"no\" with 49 forecasters chiming in. This is worrisome, because my feeling from other considerations is that \"no\" should be below 50%. But I hesitate a lot to call the crowd wrong. Finally: is being in the Olympics good or bad for Kim Jong-un (presumably the person who makes this decision)? The Olympics generate national pride in people, which I imagine to be a pro for him. And I can't see a con of the same clarity and magnitude. What does he gain by staying out? In 1988 I can see the boycott being motivated by face-saving --- presumably NK people were aware that NK was asking to co-host, and ultimately failed. Nothing like that this time. So this Kim Jong-un pro/con viewpoint also weakly points to \"yes\". So, out of respect for the crowd, I'm going to give \"yes\" the highest probability the crowd has ever given it: 26%. Now what are the odds of medal? NK has been in 8 Winter Olympics, winning medals in 2 of them. This makes 25% chance. But Russia is out of these WO, so bump that up to 30%. So 0.26*0.3 ~ 8% chance of medal, and 18% chance of participating but no medal.
