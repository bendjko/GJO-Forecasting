The exchange rate hasn't been below 6.3 since its big three day run up in August. Since then the RMB's biggest daily rise was from about 6.47 to a around 6.385 in early September. A quick scouring of the charts shows an average trading day movement since then has been less than a third of that open to close. There has been virtually no movement on any period from late afternoon on Fridays (EST) to Sunday afternoons (EST). Given that it is now 15:25 EST on a Friday there is little reason to think there will be much movement in the next day.  The only thing that seems to move the RMB a required amount on any given day is a change in the trading band as set each day by the PBOC. I can find no record of them doing this on a weekend. The currency markets don't technically close. There is just extremely limited liquidity so, unlike stock markets, big moves are still possible. Given that tomorrow is a holiday in many parts of the world an announement of that nature before the deadline moves up even higher above 99% than it already was for me.  Furthermore, instability in Chinese markets has been a massive preoccupation for Chinese officials this year after all of the instability in their main stock markets this year. This pushes the needle even further towards 0% that an announcement of this kind will be made before the deadline.  One caveat: One November 4, 2015, Bloomberg published an article about the PBOC publishnig some 5 month old comments from governor Zhou Xiaochuan as if they were new. This seems to have mainly impacted stock indexes, though. If they were to somehow misrelease an old change in the trading band then I suppose a massive change in the currency rate could ensue. If I could assign a probability of 0.01% to 6.3 or below I would.  Instead, I rounded down.  I also rounded down to 0% for the next two ranges.  For 6.35 to 6.4 I may have assigned a probability of about 0.05%.  Barring any PBOC blunders it seems nothing less than an above ground nuclear test by North Korea could do much to roil markets so much in the next 24 hours or so. Even then, you would have to assume that the PBOC would either be so overwhelmed that they couldn't protect their band or that they got out a statement in time on a weekend. None of this adds up to anywhere near 0.5% probability for me and so no need to round up to 1% in any category. Note added January 07, 2016 (seven days after closing): Talk about needing to test even one's most basic assumptions. When I made this post I thought it was Friday when it was in fact Thursday. Although this fact would not have moved me from 0% it underscores for me that no assumption can be too basic to test."], [10235, "2015-12-31T20:18:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [14355, "2015-12-31T16:10:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12806, "2015-12-31T15:30:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [3264, "2015-12-31T14:37:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [13050, "2015-12-31T14:18:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-31T13:34:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [12118, "2015-12-31T13:30:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14346, "2015-12-31T12:38:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [12837, "2015-12-31T09:35:18Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], ""], [14235, "2015-12-31T09:31:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [3577, "2015-12-31T08:26:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [10039, "2015-12-31T06:30:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [11454, "2015-12-31T06:10:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Increasing for passage of time"], [1450, "2015-12-31T05:56:35Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.88], ""], [6303, "2015-12-31T04:22:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "The Chinese economy continues to weaken, especially real estate highlighted in the news today.\nThere is some fear that the real estate and stock market bubbles will burst."], [5001, "2015-12-31T03:45:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1624, "2015-12-31T03:44:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Currently trading at 6.49 & has been above this level since early December - I don't see reasons for a sharp movement of RMB strengthening in the remaining 24 hours or so"], [11184, "2015-12-31T03:19:44Z", [0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.96], "Currently at 6.49, unlikely to gap up or down"], [12345, "2015-12-31T02:34:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [98, "2015-12-31T01:14:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [643, "2015-12-31T01:03:20Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.97], ""], [368, "2015-12-31T00:08:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14166, "2015-12-30T23:55:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15], ""], [14304, "2015-12-30T17:58:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "One - long - day remaining !

The current exchange rate is 6.4807 (Dec 21). In 10 days, I am estimating that there is only a 11% chance it falls below 6.40. This is based on the (very) few things I know about the yuan / USD exchange rate, namely:\n(1) The yuan is a \"managed float\" currency. The exchange rate is largely controlled by the Chinese government, and is under-going a managed devaluation to stimulate export growth due to a weakening economy.\n(2)  On Nov 30, the yuan entered the IMF's selective basket of reserve currencies, and the Chinese government has vowed to keep the yuan stable\nSo the question becomes: What is the likelihood of the government to reverse the current devaluation strategy, in the next 10 days, so that the exchange rate falls below 6.40 USD?\nFrankly, if all my assumptions are right, then it will be even more unlikely than I have estimated here. However, there's still a lot I don't know on this topic, so I've left room to allow for my ignorance. *Like you, I'm learning to forecast.

That would have prompted China\u2019s currency to strengthen dramatically. But few goods or services are priced in SDRs. Instead, admission to the currency club is significant mainly for its symbolism: the IMF is lending its imprimatur to the yuan as a reserve currency\u2014a safe, liquid asset in which governments can park their wealth. Indeed, far from setting off a groundswell of demand for the yuan, the IMF\u2019s decision may pave the way for the yuan\u2019s depreciation.\n[...]\nThough still far from being a free-floating currency\u2014the central bank has intervened since August to prop the yuan up\u2014the cost of such intervention is now higher. The PBOC must spend real money during the trading day to guide the yuan to its desired level. Inclusion in the SDR will only deepen expectations that China let market forces decide the yuan\u2019s exchange rate. The point of the SDR is to weave disparate currencies together into a single, diversified unit; some have suggested, for example, that commodities be quoted in SDRs to reduce the volatility of pricing them in dollars. But if China maintains its de facto peg to the dollar, the result of adding the yuan to the SDR will be to boost the dollar\u2019s weight in the basket, undermining its purpose. What would happen if China really did give the market the last word on the yuan? For some time it has been under downward pressure. The simplest yardstick is the decline in China\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves, from a peak of nearly $4 trillion last year to just over $3.5 trillion now, a reflection, in part, of the PBOC\u2019s selling of dollars to support the yuan. Were it not for tighter capital controls since the summer, outflows might have been even bigger. And the yuan does look overvalued. Despite China\u2019s slowing economy, the yuan\u2019s continued link to the surging dollar has put it near an all-time high in trade-weighted terms, up by more than 13% in the past 18 months. With the Federal Reserve set to start raising interest rates, at the same time as China is loosening its monetary policy, the yuan is likely to come under more downward pressure, at least against the dollar. It would be foolhardy to predict that China will suddenly give the market totally free rein. That would go against its deep-seated preference for gradual reform. But while basking in the glow of its SDR status, China must also be aware of the responsibility to minimise currency intervention that comes with it. A weaker yuan may well be the result. \n~~~ COMMENT: Certainly seems like the USDCNY will be trading higher."], [11862, "2015-11-30T18:47:29Z", [0.91, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09], "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-29/chinese-currency-drops-3-month-lows-imf-sdr-inclusion-decision-looms"], [73, "2015-11-30T18:32:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], "rationale as before, china will let drift after being accepted in SDR.

Sources: Dateline 11-1-15 As China\u2019s Communist Party leaders began rolling out a blueprint last week to manage a transition to more balanced growth over the next five years, they confront the immediate task of halting the economy\u2019s slide toward a debt-deflation trap. The central bank stepped up efforts last month to avert that risk with a sixth interest-rate cut in a year. While easier policy helps tide over the short term, a long-term fix needs leaders to back reforms in the 13th five-year plan that slash excess industrial capacity, rev up new growth drivers and shift funding away from deadbeat state companies to vibrant private ones. China\u2019s total outstanding borrowing has surged by two-thirds since 2008 to 208 percent of gross domestic product, producer prices have slumped for 43 consecutive months and the consumer price index began a downward trajectory in the middle of last year. The risk is a vicious downward spiral that traps companies as their assets lose value at the same time as real financing costs rise, forcing them to borrow more to stay afloat in a cascading downward plunge. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-01/china-s-slide-toward-debt-deflation-trap-needs-5-year-plan-fix USD/CNY just now 6.3174 http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/USDCNY:CUR  Dateline 10-24-15 Chinese officials on Friday mostly followed a well-worn playbook, putting in effect a number of measures designed to help lower corporate borrowing costs. The central bank cut interest rates for the sixth time in less than a year, and it freed up banks to lend more money for the fourth time since November. The government also took a step toward easing the pressures for consumers, by removing a cap on the interest rates that banks can pay for deposits.

If this rate had been totally free-floating and there were no other factors to consider, you would expect the rate on 1/1/16 to be 6.37*(1+3% annual rate difference btw currencies / 365 * 92 days) = 6.42 on that day based on interest rate parity. HOWEVER, the PBOC has been quickly depleting reserves in order to hold the yuan this strong, while the USD has appreciated dramatically over the last year and a half against basically all currencies.  The credit cycle in China has seemed to enter a downtrend over the last few months or more.  Property values had also started to downtrend, but easing measures in that regard have flattened the downtrend for the last few months.  While China has tons of reserves and enormous capacity to ease in many, many ways, all the methods of easing lead to increased devaluation pressure on the renminbi.  Devaluation itself will help China cushion its fall, and I'm not sure why the PBOC has been so stubborn about seeing that, but at some point the market should/will overwhelm the PBOC's strengthening efforts. Another thing to consider is that even within the recent band of movement, at 6.37 the renminbi is on the strong side, so even ignoring the longer-term factors, it will likely be back over 6.4 soon.  6.3-6.4 is quite a narrow band, so that range is the least probable in my opinion. I also am not so bullish on the USD.  The USD has appreciated so much in the last year and a half apparently b/c they have announced an intent to tighten monetary policy while the rest of the world loosens further while we veer towards global deflation.  I think the Fed will have to veer back towards easing, eventually, as well, which will take the USD down. Also, b/c the interest rate for renminbi is higher than that for the USD, the USD strenthens in a \"risk-off\" situation relative to the renminbi.  So if the world continues on the recent general \"risk off\" direction, this will heap pressure on the renminbi to devalue. The PBOC could decide to temporarily screw over the market/speculators by moving the rate further in a strong direction.  Also, China's property market could start to ignite again or the USD may weaken, which may take pressure off selling the renminbi,  so I assume the probability that it's under 6.3 at ~15-20%.

In fact, not only are the basing assumptions on 7, but using 8 by the end of 2016.  Given the typically excessively positive outlook of Chinese government agencies, I would consider these figures the absolute baseline for what to expect.    That means expect at a baseline a 10% devaluation by late 2015 early 2016, and a nearly 30% drop by the end of 2016.\n...\nBy pegging the RMB it has to keep interest rates artificially high and spend dollars to buy RMB reducing liquidity.

Capital appears to be flowing out at a faster rate with Capital Economics estimating August outflows at $130 billion up from $75 billion in July.  As I have noted, this number has been regularly increasing for a while now and shows no signs of slowing down.  This is placing downward pressure on the RMB so much that China is tightening capital controls.  <...>  Beijing implementing stronger capital controls will demonstrate nothing more than a complete loss of control of the financial situation and investor confidence.  Furthermore, the offshore rate is widening its divergence with the onshore rate to now about 1.5%\n...\nEven at the rate of $100 billion a month, using the IMF baseline, it would have 9 months of FX reserve depletion.  Assuming it went further, it would have 18-24 months.\" But:\n\"There is only one scenario under which this policy makes real sense.  If Beijing believes that (dirty) floating the RMB and releasing capital controls would prompt a flood of capital out of the country that would drain liquidity from the financial system prompting a banking crisis, this policy makes some sense.  It definitely doesn\u2019t solve the problem and only delays the day of reckoning, but that is undoubtedly a worse outcome and may help explain the current policy.  Given the slight tightening in capital outflows we have seen, this would seem to make some sense.  In other words, while China may be causing itself some pain by keeping interest rates high and tightening liquidity in a weak and slowing economy, the other obvious option might, as the hypothesized Beijing trade off goes, precipitate a currency and banking crisis.

This is likely to spook global markets further.  As China gains more success in promoting the renminbi to other foreign central banks, the mere substitution of US dollar for renminbi would act as a stop to the freefall of the currency. Once included into the SDR, the renminbi will also gain seigniorage value as a reserve currency China\u2019s latest currency decisions have indeed been, at least in part, a bid to internationalise its currency. For three days in a row last month, the PBoC devalued the renminbi in its daily fixing against the US dollar by 1.8% on 11 August, 1.6%, on 12 August, and 1.1% on 13 August \u2013 a total of 4.5% in three days (see chart).  Market participants who initially saw the PBoC\u2019s announcement as a liberalisation move rather than one of devaluation were subsequently convinced there was some degree of the latter intended by policymakers. But, in our view, the two objectives hold equal weight \u2013 the need to switch to a free market mechanism and second, the need to revive growth. There has been a question about the Chinese currency\u2019s official exchange rate, being a true market rate given the actual spot market was trading nowhere close to it. Hence, it was inevitable that the PBoC had to \u2018fix its fixing\u2019. It also seems clear that the move was implicitly sanctioned by the IMF, as evidenced by a statement the day after to say it welcomes the PBoC\u2019s move and that the consequent devaluation of the renminbi would not impact the SDR decision.\n\n. . .
