If Montenegro was to have a pro-Russian government, the prospects of ratification of  NATO membership would slip to zero for the duration of it. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/europe/finger-pointed-at-russians-in-alleged-coup-plot-in-montenegro.html?emc=edit_th_20161127&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=77825025 \"With a few thousand soldiers, a handful of tanks and only 600,000 residents, Montenegro \u2014 whose application to join NATO was accepted in May and now awaits ratification \u2014 is hardly a military powerhouse. But it controls the only stretch of coastline where warships can dock between Gibraltar and eastern Turkey not already in the hands of the alliance. \u201cThere is a big struggle going on,\u201d . . .  \u201cWe are the last piece of the Mediterranean that is not already in NATO, the last piece in a big puzzle.\u201d . . . \"Kotor Bay [is} a deepwater haven long coveted by both Russia and the West for its strategic location. \"In early October, Father Krivokapic presided over a ceremony in Kotor for the foundation of the Balkan Cossack Army, a Russian-led grouping of Pan-Slavic nationalists bitterly hostile to NATO. The priest described the gathering as \u201cjust folklore,\u201d featuring men in fur hats and imperial-era costumes. Yet it was also attended by members of the Night Wolves, a Russian motorcycle gang whose leader is a friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s, and mercenaries who have fought in eastern Ukraine on the side of Russian-backed separatists. \"The anti-NATO clamor has succeeded in weakening already lukewarm public support for the alliance, which even some pro-Western voices view as a needless provocation of Russia and a ploy by Milo Djukanovic, Montenegro\u2019s longtime and notoriously devious leader, to cement his power with help from the United States. So when Mr. Djukanovic announced that his government was the target of a Russian-backed plot in October, opposition politicians \u2014 both pro- and anti-NATO \u2014 as well as much of the news media and many independent observers dismissed the claim as a fairy tale. Since then, however, Mr. Sindjelic, has begun talking. He was held for three weeks . . .  and then released this past week as a \u201cprotected witness.\u201d . He has told investigators about his visit to Moscow, about sophisticated encrypted telephones and about the more than $200,000 he says he was given as a down payment for his role as a recruiter of muscle for the operation, people close to the investigation said. Also talking is another central figure in the alleged plot, a former Serbian gendarmerie commander named Bratislav Dikic. He initially denied any involvement after his arrest on Oct. 16 shortly before polling began in an election that the pro-Russian opposition politicians had hoped to win. The results were inconclusive.\n. . . .\n\". . . the Montenegrin prosecutor handling the coup case, told reporters in early November that there was no solid proof yet that the Russian state had been involved. He blamed \u201cRussian nationalists\u201d who wanted \u201cto stop Montenegro on its Euro-Atlantic path, especially to prevent its accession to NATO.\u201d . . .\nThe official version of what happened in October still contains many holes, including the failure by the authorities in Montenegro to produce any of the weapons they say were to be used in an Election Day attack on Parliament in Podgorica by conspirators disguised as police officers.\n. . . \n\"Serbia\u2019s prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, who has struggled to balance strong pro-Russian sentiment in his country with his own policy of shifting cautiously toward the West, was outraged to hear that Russian citizens and Serbian nationalists had been working together under his nose in Belgrade to stage a coup in Montenegro. He swiftly announced a shake-up of Serbia\u2019s intelligence services, many of whose members have traditionally leaned toward Russia and view the West as an enemy, a feeling that intensified with NATO\u2019s 1999 bombing campaign. \"There has also been a small shake-up in Moscow with Mr. Putin\u2019s abrupt and unexplained dismissal of Leonid Reshetnikov, a former Soviet intelligence officer, as head of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a research group that works for the Kremlin. The institute had been in the forefront of Russian efforts to derail Montenegro\u2019s NATO membership and has extensive links to pro-Russian groups in the Balkans. \"After initially dismissing Montenegro\u2019s claim of a coup plot, Mr. Vucic, Serbia\u2019s prime minister, announced that there was \u201cincontrovertible evidence\u201d that \u201ccertain people\u201d had placed Mr. Djukanovic, Montenegro\u2019s leader, under close surveillance using \u201cthe most modern equipment\u201d and were reporting to co-conspirators who \u201cwere supposed to act in accordance with their instructions.\u201d  Several people \u201cwho were acting in coordination with foreigners\u201d had been arrested in Serbia, he said. Among those arrested was Mr. Sindjelic . . . \"Adding to a fog of fearful foreboding, the Serbian authorities then announced they had uncovered a cache of arms near Mr. Vucic\u2019s family home in Belgrade, a stash that Serbian news media outlets said had been put there in preparation for an assassination attempt against the Serbian leader, too.  Mr. Sindjelic has told investigators that he is uncertain about the exact affiliations of Mr. Popov and Mr. Shirikov.

This is important because the parliament  will have to vote to either (1) authorize a referendum on NATO membership or (2) ratify/ accept NATO membership on its own.    So, the questions are:\n-will the public peacefully accept the election results?  There's a fear that Putin may fund protests.  Ironically, this might have the effect of strengthening the government in power.\n-will DPS (with 36 out of 81 seats) form a coalition government and Dukanovic return as PM?  This most likely would result in a vote by parliament to accept the invitation to join NATO, or\n-will the opposition parties form a coalition government?  This most likely would result in a vote to hold a referendum on NATO accession, which may/may not garner public support And finally,  can all of this, as well as ratification by about 20 more countries, happen in the next approx 2 months. I say \"No.\" ~~~~~~~~~\nhttp://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/10/16/montenegro-elections-beyond-nato-russia-dichotomy/ \"Some of the opposition parties demand that the decision on membership be taken directly by the citizens via a referendum, while a vote in the parliament is the route NATO expects from Montenegro. For the Alliance, a referendum is the least desirable option, and the reasons are clear: public support for membership is not very high, and the risks of a \u2018no\u2019 vote would be considerable.  . . .  \"For NATO, the refusal of the invitation to join the alliance would set a decidedly unfavourable precedent.  . . . because of the fact that Russia is openly opposed to Montenegro\u2019s NATO accession, and a Montenegrin \u2018no\u2019 vote would be a victory for Russia in what is now popularly referred to as \u2018hybrid warfare\u2019.  . . .  \"The much toughened fight against corruption and organised crime which has been playing out over the past 20 months is mostly an effect of EU and NATO conditionality and of the distancing from the Russian \u2018business model\u2019. But this fight is also closely linked to the economic situation. Stopping the abuse of public office, the undue seizure of state property and the large-scale tax dodging would greatly improve the stability and the sustainability of Montenegro\u2019s budget. . . .  \"Montenegro\u2019s most transparent election yet.  This election is held in conditions which are previously unseen in Montenegro. \n. . . \n\"Looked at from the outside, the 2016 parliamentary elections are thus being held with the most regular and transparent conditions so far. The leading party DPS has never been exposed to so many detailed checks. This does not mean, however, that the control of the opposition parties within the government has been flawless and entirely successful. It only stands as a reminder of how complex and problematic the electoral cycles are in Montenegro, . . .  \"According to estimates based on publicly available information, the political parties have spent more than ever on this election. . . . The question of where the DF get their money from has been much debated, but the answer to it is not known yet. The DPS accuse them of being financed by the Russian tycoons close to Vladimir Putin, with the aim of stopping Montenegro\u2019s accession to NATO.  . . . DPS\u2019 campaign funding has also remained leargely unclear so far. It is emblematic of the wider picture that the funding of Montenegro\u2019s two most influential parties is a mystery. \". . .  the DPS has decided . . .  to let their leader, Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, be the mouthpiece of the whole campaign . . . who remains the most influential and the most powerful figure in the country.  In his appearances, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 sent a message characterising these elections as a test for the independence of Montenegro, for the safeguarding of its identity and sovereignty, which is the same topic that was debated at the referendum held ten years ago.\n. . . \n\"Regardless of the result of the elections, it is not realistic to expect that a government will be formed soon. If the DPS do not manage to gather enough votes to form a comfortable majority with the parties representing the ethnic minorities (Bosniaks, Albanians and Croats), who are DPS\u2019 usual allies, the formation of the government could become very complex. \"One possible outcome is that the \u2018pro-Western\u2019 forces might agree to form a government which wlll finalise the NATO accession process and continue on the EU integration path. This government would be very similar to the \u2018Government of electoral trust\u2019 which was in power before the elections.  As things stand, the biggest obstacle to the realisation of this scenario is the agreement which was signed by the opposition parties \u2013 which have committed themselves not to agree, under any circumstances, to forming a government with the DPS. On the other hand, another obstacle for government formation without the DPS is that some opposition parties have incompatible stances on foreign policy issues, such as NATO, the recognition of Kosovo and the sanctions against Russia. The hardest line is represented by the DF, which is at the same time the strongest opposition party, likely to scoop a considerable share of the vote. It is yet unclear how a compromise on these issues could be found between the DF and pro-Western parties such as SDP and the movement URA. \"Although the incoherence of the opposition\u2019s stances on foreign policy plays in the DPS\u2019 favour, their position is not much easier. . . . the possible opposition partners would be able to claw back a good amount of power from the party that has been continuously ruling over Montenegro from the end of the second world war . . . .\n. . . \n\"The country\u2019s economic situation is very worrying: strikes by unhappy citizens or workers of failed state enterprises are an everyday occurrance. Autumn 2015 was marked by anti-government protests which ended in street unrests \u2013 a reminder that a slender majority would not be able to guarantee stability to Montenegro. \"A further challenge will be maintaining peace and order in the country after the announcement of the results. . . .  it cannot be excluded that certain political forces might declare the elections \u2018stolen\u2019 and call citizens onto the streets. Montenegro does not have a track record of protests ending peacefully, nor has it so far ever been possible to actually protect the \u2018electoral will\u2019 in this way. Quite on the contrary, such demonstrations have usually ended up with the strengthening of the government in power, seen as a stronghold against the \u2018destructive opposition\u2019."], [691, "2016-10-20T19:04:47Z", [0.0], ""], [23102, "2016-10-20T18:01:31Z", [0.0], ""], [51, "2016-10-20T17:34:34Z", [0.0], ""], [12605, "2016-10-20T14:10:14Z", [0.0], "Sometimes, policy decisions are written in such clean form, you simply have to take notice: The German upper house \"decided ... not to raise any objections against the legislative draft.\"  (thereby accepting the ratification of Montenegro's accession, on 14 Oct) https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/drucksachen/2016/0401-0500/497-16(B).pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1\n---"], [24771, "2016-10-20T08:39:40Z", [0.0], ""], [25141, "2016-10-20T08:38:06Z", [0.0], ""], [14414, "2016-10-20T07:12:42Z", [0.0], ""], [1738, "2016-10-19T23:41:20Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-19T21:36:59Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-19T19:02:40Z", [0.0], ""], [27738, "2016-10-19T11:26:42Z", [0.0], ""], [19538, "2016-10-19T09:05:11Z", [0.01], ""], [1529, "2016-10-19T02:32:07Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-18T21:15:37Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-18T20:56:25Z", [0.0], ""], [823, "2016-10-18T20:06:43Z", [0.02], ""], [11872, "2016-10-18T19:37:15Z", [0.02], ""], [1808, "2016-10-18T10:44:30Z", [0.01], ""], [11080, "2016-10-18T07:46:52Z", [0.01], ""], [3225, "2016-10-18T03:27:57Z", [0.0], ""], [14880, "2016-10-18T03:20:48Z", [0.0], "Ratification by member states won't be complete until Spring 2017.

Any GJP forecaster that has diligently followed the topic of the accession of Montenegro to NATO over the past year or so will likely come away with the feeling that they know more about the issue than the two senior Senators of this committee, that U.S. foreign policy is so ridiculous that it would assume a defensive commitment in such a nonchalant fashion, and with the impression that it's a \"done deal.\" As to timing, the pathetic Senate, as with the rest of the world generally, is being hustled along so as to \"move forward as expeditiously as possible.\" [I lost some regard for Senator Johnson here. First, he uses the instance of 9-11 as an example of alliance solidarity. Then, he casually discounts the risk of guaranteeing the defense of Montenegro by citing the fact that it is 800 or so miles from the closest Russian border. Setting aside the obvious near-sightedness of presuming Russia to be the only possible relevant adversary, the very example of alliance unity he cites is one where border distance was not relevant. That's sloppy thinking. I also lost regard for the entire U.S. Senate here as well. What could be more important to ninety-five or so other senators than the heaping on of additional political and military risk to this country over the foreseeable future? I pray that this event is not one that some future historian, in seeking to reconstruct the progression of some future conflict, looks upon with aghast disbelief -- as I am so doing today.]"], [368, "2016-09-12T21:02:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-09-12T19:05:59Z", [0.09], ""], [823, "2016-09-12T17:39:53Z", [0.05], ""], [14933, "2016-09-12T15:01:05Z", [0.02], ""], [14208, "2016-09-12T13:38:06Z", [0.1], ""], [73, "2016-09-12T13:10:58Z", [0.02], ""], [73, "2016-09-12T12:45:14Z", [0.32], ""], [498, "2016-09-12T09:33:25Z", [0.96], "\"members of the Alliance will ratify Montenegro\u2019s Accession Protocol to NATO this autumn.\" (+1)\nhttp://cherna.gora.me/news/mvpei-members-will-ratify-the-protocol-by-autumn/ But at the same time, \"no indications that the process of ratification will take longer than spring next year,\" so, take your pick."], [10759, "2016-09-12T04:52:08Z", [0.22], ""], [4634, "2016-09-12T04:50:44Z", [0.22], ""], [6303, "2016-09-12T01:44:56Z", [1.0], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [6303, "2016-09-12T01:34:32Z", [0.01], "Mistake!"], [14777, "2016-09-12T01:06:21Z", [0.15], ""], [14208, "2016-09-12T00:19:44Z", [1.0], "ooops.  what kind of deal was made here?

Just to call something \"democratic\" does not make it so. So, for example, from my perspective, whatever good the EU has, it is fatally flawed because it is anti-democratic. Yet, some people still call it democratic. Perhaps we need to establish some minimum level of democracy before we allow such terms to be applied as labels to organizations or governments. Moreover, from Dilma in Brazil, the Panama Papers, and my dear friend @ravel's consistent reminders, I've learned that any degree of democracy is no democracy at all if it is subverted by corruption. In that sense, \"corruption-free\" is a necessary condition for any degree of democracy to obtain. And, the greater the degree of democracy an organization looks like it has from its formal structure, the greater the amount of democracy that is lost when it is not corruption-free. So, at least for myself, I'm beginning to get really picky in allowing myself to assent to designations of \"democracy\" based on mere labeling alone."], [25021, "2016-06-24T08:51:47Z", [0.45], "Five down, 23 to go.

A little more interesting is this: \"Montenegro has agreed a new contract with the Washington-based firm Orion Strategies to advocate for the country's accession bid, according to a US Department of Justice filing. The firm will provide strategic communications, PR and advocacy around issues and news relating to Montenegro in the US and Europe and around the country's bid for membership of the Western military alliance. Orion Strategies will receive $150,000 for services delivered over a 12-month period ending on February 1, 2017\"[2].  ***Update: I had the wrong Orion Strategies. The one in Washington, DC is quite small, no more than 4 employees. So I guess the same questions apply, for whatever they're worth: http://www.manta.com/c/mm7skmv/orion-strategies A few thoughts about this latter nugget: First, I wouldn't want to make too much of the 2017 termination date. It's probably just a result of when the contract was signed. Second, $150K doesn't seem like much. How much value are they going to get for that kind of money. This would get you two experienced IT guys, if you're lucky. That's all you're going to spend on lobbying the US gov't? Perhaps Montenegro's gov't doesn't think much work needs to be done. Third, who the hell are these Orion guys? Though the article refers to Orion as \"Washington-based,\" it looks like it's actually located in West Virginia[3]. I've sent them an email asking for clarification. It's not a big deal, but why would you wire a WV firm to lobby in DC? Honestly, Orion seems a little bush league. Again, I'm not sure whether Montenegro's gov't thinks that this one is in the bag or whether they've just made some bad choices, and their accession protocol is going to receive ratification more slowly than it otherwise might have.  As of this writing, no NATO member has, to the best of my knowledge, approved the accession protocol for Montenegro. -- [1] http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_130581.htm - also reported on in the \"New York Times\": http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/05/06/world/europe/ap-eu-montenegro-nato.html\n[2] http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-hires-us-lobbists-to-push-nato-case-05-05-2016#sthash.Y9gI9Hox.dpuf\n[3] http://www.orion-strategies.com/pages/about.html"], [691, "2016-05-07T19:31:15Z", [0.06], ""], [23006, "2016-05-07T19:23:50Z", [0.16], ""], [368, "2016-05-07T19:16:52Z", [0.0], ""], [14613, "2016-05-07T18:33:51Z", [0.2], ""], [22983, "2016-05-07T17:48:27Z", [0.11], ""], [4992, "2016-05-07T14:56:31Z", [0.05], ""], [14493, "2016-05-07T14:55:39Z", [0.05], "As others have said if the earliest likely agreement for Montenegro to join NATO is the Warsaw Summit on 8/9th of July and then all members will need to agree to it it will probably take until after the end of 2016.

The vote is a move to pressure the authorities to organize a national plebiscite on NATO membership. The Montenegrin Movement for Neutrality said that more than 7,000 of the people . . .  had voted online . . .  \"to make their voice heard, whether they are for or against NATO or for neutrality,\" [according to] the organization's director . . . . \"Some 55,000 Montenegrins reportedly signed a petition by April 1, organized by the opposition Socialist People\u2019s Party, urging the government to hold a referendum om NATO. . . . By law, a national referendum may be held on the President's or government\u2019s initiative, following a demand by at least 25 of the 82 lawmakers of parliament, or following a request submitted by 10 per cent of all registered voters, which is 52,806 citizens. \"The government has repeated that Montenegro has no constitutional obligation to hold a referendum on membership of international organizations, noting that only a few NATO member countries organized such a vote.

Montenegro is a young nation without much historical or cultural cohesion.  Like Ukraine, half the country is Byzantine Catholic and pro-Europe/west-leaning, while the other half is Russian Orthodox and pro-Russia/east-leaning.  This division is far, far older than the country and won't be healed anytime soon.  However, nevertheless, it sounds like improving public support for NATO membership is one of the items on Montenegro's \"to do\" list for NATO membership:  something I consider an impossible task, which, I'm assuming NATO officials/members will just brush under the rug in the end.

It can't be a surprise that at least some \"political and public figures of Montenegro\" are not in favor of joining NATO. Is there any major U.S. policy that isn't strongly resisted by at least some political and public figures here? Ah, the course of true NATO membership never did run smooth. Moreover, Russian sources (like this one) tend to skew anti-NATO, so whatever value this news item should be discounted.  More important, perhaps, is the continued silence about Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic's comments on joining NATO is mid-2017[b]. Maybe Djukanovic is trying to calm down the Russians, though I'm not sure this would do the trick. Maybe Djukanovic is trying to give his domestic opponents the sense that there is more time on the shot clock than there actually is. Or maybe Djukanovic just foresees Montenegro joining NATO in mid-2017.  @Counterintelligence is quite right to point out that there has been a recent history of completing the process of joining NATO in less than a year. Sure, the sample size is small, but I take it that what's salient here is the fact that it *can* be done in less than 13 months. Montenegro is a tiny, itty-bitty speck of a nation-state. (The population of Montenegro is roughly equal to the population of Memphis, TN.) Off-hand, that suggests that questions of military and political integration might be far easier to resolve than in the case of larger nation-states like Albania (whose population is roughly equal to that of Chicago, IL - so, still pretty damn tiny).  Corruption levels are crazy high in Montenegro[c][d]. But not as high as in Albania[e], and Croatia's not that much better[f], if we want to focus on a couple of recent NATO joiners. Come to think of it, corruption levels in Montenegro are about the same as those in Italy[g]! So I don't see any special reason that corruption is likely to gum up the works.  And what's all this about Russia then[h]? I suspect - without the slightest bit of actual evidence, mind you - that Russia is pressing NATO leadership for some quid pro quo. Russia can't, of course, veto Montenegro membership, but it can create a lot of headaches that NATO leadership doesn't want to deal with. Negotiations with Putin might slow down Montenegro's membership, but we're unlikely to be privy to any of that (unless we're fluent in neo-kremlinology[i], and I'm not). So I'm sitting tight for now and waiting to see what comes next. -- [a] http://peacekeeper.ru/en/?module=news&action=view&id=29155\n[b] http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2016&mm=03&dd=17&nav_id=97404\n[c] http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/4000093/EU_montenegro_2013.pdf\n[d] https://www.transparency.org/country/#MNE - this site is so much fun!\n[e] https://www.transparency.org/country/#ALB\n[f] https://www.transparency.org/country/#HRV\n[g] https://www.transparency.org/country/#ITA\n[h] https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/yugoslavia-montenegro/2015-12-24/new-thorn-russias-side\n[i] http://foreignpolicy.com/2008/03/17/a-little-neo-kremlinology/"], [12591, "2016-03-24T22:47:05Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-03-24T20:49:13Z", [0.08], ""], [21884, "2016-03-24T08:39:32Z", [0.02], ""], [14253, "2016-03-24T03:01:59Z", [0.05], "After sitting at 100 for a few weeks this seems ever less likely."], [691, "2016-03-23T21:36:30Z", [0.08], ""], [12302, "2016-03-23T16:43:59Z", [0.01], ""], [10192, "2016-03-23T16:26:43Z", [0.71], "The process is supposed to take up to a year.

I didn't do well on the Montenegro question we had earlier.  My sense was that NATO was giving Montenegro signals that were  encouraging and were also suggesting that there was more improvement needed in several areas (rule of law, reducing organized crime & corruption, stronger democratic institutions), but then Putin over-played his hand by being too vocal in his opposition, causing Stoltenberg & NATO to do what nobody had intended or wanted to do:  offer Montenegro an invitation to join NATO.  Now, NATO has painted itself into a corner.   Accession talks were held in mid-February, and from all the reports I've been able to find, went reasonably well.  I am unclear if this was just the first set of talks, or both of them (since they were 2 days).    According to @Agent0090 http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/64689, the next steps are completion of the talks, creation of completion timetables, submission of a letter of intent by Montenegro, and preparation of Accession Protocols by NATO, all of which must occur before the membership of Montenegro can be ratified by the current members of NATO.   As other forecasters have noted, everything up to and including the preparation of the Accession Protocols will probably have to be completed by the July NATO summit in order for there to be ANY chance of ratification by all 28 NATO members before the end of the year.    Re-reading the analysis of @Jean-Pierre at http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/64672, completion of all these steps in the next 9 months will require speedy action by all NATO members.  Given that some NATO member nations (France, Germany) are less than totally enthusiastic about offering membership to former Eastern Block nations, it would not surprise me if the process dragged on into 2017."], [38, "2016-03-14T03:59:45Z", [0.22], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-hungary-idUSKCN0VY119 February 25.  \"Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said NATO should complete the accession process of Montenegro . . . .  \"His Slovak counterpart, Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, speaking at the conference, said it was obvious before the invitation was issued to Montenegro to join that NATO was itself divided about whether to continue the enlargement process. \"To speak about enlargement of NATO is not a universally accepted view in NATO currently ...

Changes to the law that define the use of Montenegrin army units in international operations will be completed by the end of March and sent to parliament. The new law will abolish the principle of voluntary service abroad. The new law will also prescribe which Montenegrin troops will be available for rapid intervention abroad if NATO allies so decide. \"Deployment will now be mandatory, which means that soldiers will have to go to Afghanistan, for example, or to some other NATO operation in future, if their superiors decide. Otherwise, they risk losing their jobs.  The obligations include modifying key security and defence laws, which must be adapted to NATO's collective defence system regulations.

But then after we have agreed on the accession then of course there is a process with the 28 parliaments where all 28 parliaments in the NATO alliance has to, or have to ratify.

The SPP is gathering signatures in the hopes of forcing a referendum and it claims it already has enough signatures to do so. It's deeply unclear (to me) what would happen if membership were put to a vote. Montenegro is very small, which makes polling a dangerous science. I'm nocking 1 percentage point of the likelihood of Montenegro's joining NATO in 2016 just to be safe. In related news, I still haven't seen any confirmation (in English!) of the remarks made by Antun Sbutega about Montenegro aiming for a 2017 entry date, though there is one in Vietnamese[2]. There's an intriguing claim made here: \"So far, Montenegro and the EU has negotiated 22 out of 34 negotiating chapters, and according to some commentators, the two sides need at least 2 to 3 years before you can pay the same process for Balkan states became the 29th member of the EU.\" The quote is a bit scrambled because I'm relying on Google for a translation. But if we're really looking at a 2-3 year process, we can forget about 2016. So I'm dropping 1 more percentage point and keeping an eye open for some of the (unnamed) sources to which the article refers.  BTW, the Vietnamese article makes the good point that Italy is an enthusiastic supporter of Montenegro's entry into NATO. I don't think I'd seen that point made before.

After all, there have been no new NATO members since 2009 (Albania and Croatia), and there has been no single nation entries since 1984 (Spain). But here we are. Montenegro applied for NATO membership in 2003 and has been moving forward with this process (more or less) steadily since then[1]. NATO issued a formal invitation to Montenegro in December of 2015, beginning the final accession talks which could be concluded at the summit in Warsaw during July of 2016[2]. Clearly, things have changed a lot since NATO bombed Montenegro 17 years ago as part of Kosovo War[3]. So - given what we now know - how likely is it that Montenegro will join in the remainder of 2016? As far as I can tell, no country that has been formally offered NATO membership has rejected it, though, of course, France left NATO in 1966, only to return later[4]. Still, I'd hesitate to assign an initial probability of 1.0 to Montenegro's accepting NATO's invitation. Instead, call it 0.98. The process of moving from invitation to acceptance usually takes 12-18 months[5]. I suspect that the best way to read that fact is that the odds of acceptance during the first 6 months are pretty low, the odds go way up for the next 2 sets of 6 months, and then get a bit lower during the following set of 6 months. That looks something like this: Jan-June 2016: 0.04 (just too quick, I think)\nJuly-Dec 2016: 0.41\nJan-June 2017: 0.41\nJuly-Dec 2017: 0.12\nBlack Swan: 0.02  So I think the baseline is a 0.45 probability that Montenegro will join in 2016. But there are some reasons for thinking that the smart prediction should be lower, and there are some reasons for thinking it should be higher. I'll go through each set. Let's start with reasons for thinking that the smart prediction should be lower. Russia is not happy about Montenegro joining NATO[6]. Of course, Russia doesn't have a formal veto. Now, Russia might use military force to try to scare Montenegro into backing away from NATO, but any attempt to do so is likely to cause Montenegro to want NATO's protection even more. And Russia might try to use more subtle pressure (economic boycotts, cyber espionage, perhaps even targeted assassinations), yet Mr. Putin hasn't shown it can do subtle terribly well, so I remain doubtful. The Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro want Montenegro to become NATO member state, but the Socialist People's Party of Montenegro is less enthusiastic. The polls have been all over the place and seem to me to be less than predictive. At any rate, I don't think the ruling parties need a plebiscite in order to continue with NATO membership, so unless the country becomes unstable because of street-level opposition, I don't think that this will slow down the process. To sum up: External Causes (i.e., Russia) = -0.08\nInternal Causes (i.e., Montenegrin opposition) = -0.01\n\nThat gives us the following results: Jan-June 2016: 0.036\nJuly-Dec 2016: 0.373\nJan-June 2017: 0.373\nJuly-Dec 2017: 0.109\nBlack Swan or Offer Rejected for External or Internal Causes: 0.11 Hence, the first adjustment to the baseline =.4095.  Now let's turn to the reasons for thinking that the smart prediction should be higher. It's worth noting that Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic survived a no-confidence vote on January 27, so he's likely to feel like he has something of a mandate to implement his agenda right now[7], before the elections in late 2016. Moreover, NATO is holding a summit meeting in Poland this summer[8]. NATO summit meetings generally happen every other year (though there are certainly exceptions)[9]. In 2009, Albania and Croatia joined NATO just 2 days before the meeting[10], so it looks like the 2016 date of the summit meeting predicts Montenegro's joining this year. However, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania joined a good 4 months before the 2004 NATO summit meeting[11]. Hence, the connection seems a little tenuous. Given the upheavals that Europe has been growing through of late, it wouldn't be much of a surprise if there was a 2017 NATO summit meeting as well.  Survival of no-confidence vote: +0.05\n2016 date of NATO summit meeting: +0.01 Thus, the smart prediction =0.4695 (which we can call 0.47).

The last two countries to enter NATO (Albania and Croatia) did so about one year after the official invitation, even with some objections in 2008-2009 from Slovenia to Croatian membership. Therefore, I think the consensus of 33 percent is low. NATO is holding its Warsaw Summit in July, which should provide further impetus for NATO and Montenegro to get this done within the year. Russia has little economic influence over Montenegro, thus diminishing intimidation from Moscow as a depressing factor. And although NATO membership is supported by less than half of Montenegro (although that is divided largely along ethnic lines), the PM just survived a no-confidence vote, so he probably has enough domestic political support to finalize NATO membership sometime in 2016 (particularly since he appears to have survived the vote by generally committing to reforms that NATO coincidentally supports -- at least rhetorically. Moreover, Montenegro represents relative low-hanging fruit (compared to Georgia, Macedonia, and others) for NATO to demonstrate that it remains a confident organization in the wake of its perceived acquiescence to Russian aggression in Ukraine. And although Montenegro wouldn't be a game changer, it does represent a somewhat militarily significant move for NATO (a military alliance after all) in that it forestalls any concern about Russian air defense and missiles making their way into the Adriatic (like Moscow is positioned in the Baltics).

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the start of formal accession negotiations between Montenegro and NATO for mid February, which for Kacin is a sign that Montenegro is ready to negotiate.

Also worth noting on this point is that he said \"up to\" 3 months.

Alright -- there's been some discussion as to whether this will resolve on the ascension talks or the ratification -- as an FYI, I submitted a clarification request. I suspect that GJ won't offer any advice and here's why... I checked into the two most recent additions of NATO memberships (i.e. base rates?) and it looks like both were classified as members AFTER the ratification. Albania --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania%E2%80%93NATO_relations#Negotiation_progress\nCroatia --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia%E2%80%93NATO_relations#Negotiation_progress Both were invited to join (April 3rd, 2008) and completed ascension protocol (July 9th, 2008) at the same time. From that data, we can probably assume that, barring anything drastic, Montenegro will probably also complete their ascension protocol before the meeting this summer (July). That means they have about 5+ months to have things ratified by all the countries who are already members (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Montenegro_to_NATO#Negotiation_progress). So, let's look and see how long it took the OTHER two countries to have things ratified. It's worth noting that BOTH of those countries had their ascension protocol completed on July 9th and that will be right around the same time that Montenegro will be having their ascension protocol completed (assuming they get things done by the summer). ***drumroll please*** Croatia and Albania didn't become full members until........ April 1st of the next year. Translation: three months too late by our deadline! If someone wants they could probably go through and look and see if there were any issues with any of the countries at the time (i.e. reasons why legislation may have been held up? From my quick scan, it looks like all countries ratifying did so for both Albania/Croatia on the same day. I did a quick count of the number of countries that ratified after Dec 31st (because that's what we're interested in, right?) By my count -- 9 out of 26 countries ratified after Dec 31. Not only would Montenegro need to have those 9 countries on the right side of Dec 31st, they'd have to have two MORE countries (Albania/Croatia) on the right side of Dec 31 -- and that assumes that some of those countries that ratified on the right side of Dec 31st wouldn't slip into the following year. It's worth noting, for those of you who think that the US might hold things up, I suspect not (?) because the US ratified Croatia/Albania on... September 26th, 2008. Not only was it an election year, there were other major events happening in the US at the time. For those interested, here's a list of those who ratified after Dec 31st for Albania/Croatia:\n*Belgium (Jan 29)\n*Canada (Jan 14)\n*France (Feb 4)\n*Greece (Feb 17)\n*Iceland (Feb 12)\n*Luxembourg (Feb 12)\n*Netherlands (Feb 17)\n*Portugal (Feb 13)\n*Slovenia (Feb 9) And here's seven countries that ratified in December:\n*Czech Republic (Dec 22)\n*Denmark (Dec 9)\n*Estonia (Dec 19)\n*Germany (Dec 19)\n*Italy (Dec 23)\n*Spain (Dec 18)\n*UK (Dec 19) And two more in late November:\n*Norway (Nov 24)\n*Turkey (Nov 26) All that to say...

So\u2026 NATO: MAP 2002 \u00e0 Member 2009 = 7 Years EU: SAA 2000 , enforce 2005 \u00e0 Member 2013 = 13 Years 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now let us look at Montenegro. MAP in 2009, SAA in 2005 and enforced in 2010. It even has Schengen and already unofficially the Euro. NATO: MAP 2009 + 7 year = 2016 EU: SAA 2005 + 13 Years = 2018 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, usually first Nato than EU if you look at all previous members.

So, what is the potential problem? 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Poverty. At 6,3 k$/p, that is not very much. Albania was removed from msot EU talks due to unsuccessful reforms, otherwise known as being \u201cpoor\u201d, yet was still taken into NATO\u2026 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The only element is pissing off Russia, yet one must ask how strong of the ties and interest is of Russia. They don\u2019t speak Russia, they is no Russian minority, so it is a very different issue as with Lithuania. In retrospect, there inclusion shouldn\u2019t do much except signalize the expansion as such. So, all aspect point to a yes and a definitive yes. The only issue is timing.

Montenegro has consistently stated its desire to join and has been part of the accession process since 2006. They have provided troops for NATO operations and have the support of a number of key members. They have been invited to join and are currently at the final accession stage that requires ratification from all other member states. New NATO members tend to be accepted into the organisation at summits. The next summit is in July 2016 in Warsaw and comments from NATO and Montenegro have pointed to this event as the target for full membership.  We don't live in isolation though and there are a number of external factors that should be taken into account. Current relations between Russia and NATO are poor. One reason for this is the topic of Ukraine and Georgia possibly becoming NATO members in the future. Any expansion of NATO in this environment is likely to shine a light on Ukraine and Georgia membership again which will antagonize the Russian leadership. Russia has gone as far as saying that joining NATO makes Montenegro a target for Russian missiles. This has led some NATO members to question the timing of Montenegro's accession with France being one of the more vocal opponents. There is also opposition to membership at home that stems partly from the 1999 bombing of Montenegro by NATO forces. Protests have increased in recent months. Despite these complications I still believe that full membership will be awarded to Montenegro around the date of the Warsaw summit. Russia was posturing before Montenegro was officially invited to join in December 2015. While Russia may shout even louder once they do become members it is more to do with Ukraine and Georgia than  A small nation with three other countries between Russia and themselves. Montenegro does have important port access to the Aegean but access to this is not a realistic possibility for Russia.  Domestic opposition is similar to what was seen in Croatia and Albania prior to their accession and is unlikely to change the current momentum towards full membership. One possible delaying factor is the necessary approval from all other members. France has voiced concerns about the timing of accession and full membership requires unanimous approval. It remains to be seen how strongly France feels about holding Montenegro back for a period of time. In the wake of attacks in Paris, one could argue that a new member of NATO in the Balkans will help protect Europe from terrorist attacks but that seems to be a fairly weak assumption. Perhaps with the ratification by the likes of Germany and the US, France's opposition will fall away. The risk of a member country not ratifying is currently the largest threat to full membership. If there were significant concerns I would imagine the invitation to join would not have been given in December 2015. I also believe that NATO will want to avoid any embarrassing disagreements among member states in the current environment. Therefore, combined with some risk that Montenegro gets cold feet due to saber rattling by Russia, I think the chances of them not joining in 2016 are low and in the region of 13%. This risk will increase if we fail to see the ratification process begin around May 2016 in time for a formal announcement in July."], [15025, "2016-01-12T21:23:52Z", [0.5], ""], [85, "2016-01-12T17:27:43Z", [0.4], ""], [131, "2016-01-12T17:11:12Z", [0.1], ""], [823, "2016-01-12T15:46:56Z", [0.25], ""], [15075, "2016-01-12T15:23:37Z", [0.1], ""], [1468, "2016-01-12T10:23:13Z", [0.37], ""], [3460, "2016-01-12T10:22:59Z", [0.65], ""], [12302, "2016-01-12T04:35:46Z", [0.32], ""], [601, "2016-01-11T21:02:06Z", [0.23], ""], [10039, "2016-01-11T19:18:12Z", [0.33], ""], [691, "2016-01-11T17:38:08Z", [0.27], ""], [13897, "2016-01-11T10:51:03Z", [0.75], ""], [12915, "2016-01-11T05:10:02Z", [0.6], ""], [12915, "2016-01-11T05:04:49Z", [0.4], ""], [14995, "2016-01-11T03:34:43Z", [0.9], "Highly likely given the recent formal invitation by NATO, and the upcoming Warsaw Summit.

Sep 2015 parliament vote (50 of 79 in favor)\n-Only one country this time means the process should be faster than three previous rounds which, in any event, have been getting progressively shorter. Last time took 1 year 3 days (thanks, Jean-Pierre).\n-Very small military (I read 2 800 with 5 helicopters) so can't be too much to work out with respect to integration/coordination.\n-Opposition outisde parliament is seemingly marginal and very unlikely to delay the process. \n-Can be seen as at least a bit of military push back on Russia given its recent (Ukraine) perceived aggression in Europe. The sooner the better, I suspect some may think . Those pushing me lower:\n-Endogenous opposition forces are not non-existent and may find some means of delaying the process long enough.\n-Maybe things escalate in some important and relevant way in Syria/Iran (or ME generally) that Russia could be very useful in helping to solve. Perhaps delayed accession would be used as a bargaining chip. (Based on public statements from official sources Russia strongly opposes accession. This is consistent with long standing positions on NATO expansion so can probably be taken at face value) \n-Further rancour in the EU over mass immigration and perceived unsatisfactory responses may get some nations (who may not see Montenegrin accession as very important) to use opposition to accession as a bargaining chip. The rationale would be that larger nations in Europe, seen to be asking too much of smaller nations on the immigration front, would care more about Montenegro's accession. The smaller nations, knowing this, would threaten to delay accession until the EU took more decisive action to stem the flow of immigrants. This kind of cross organization conflation of issues would probably carry some real costs as there is not 100% overlap in membership.

They stated that they expect further progress on reforms, especially in the area of rule of law and that NATO will continue to provide support and assistance though the MAP. During the period leading up to accession, NATO will involve Montenegro in Alliance activities to the greatest extent possible, including the Warsaw Summit in July 2016. In February 2010, Montenegro decided to contribute troops to the NATO-led International Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, which were deployed there together with a Croatian unit. Following the completion of ISAF\u2019s operation at the end of 2014, Montenegro is currently supporting the follow-on mission (\u2018Resolute Support\u2019) to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. In support of past efforts to equip and train the Afghan National Army, Montenegro donated more than 1,600 weapons and 250,000 rounds of ammunition. The government has also pledged financial support for the future development of the Afghan National Security Forces.  The net contribution of any given country invited to join NATO is largely dependent on this aspect of security-military relations.  If it's net contribution or utility does not exceed the net cost of its participation, it is reasonable to expect that an invitation to membership is problematic; in such cases, it is unlikely that it would even be included in the MAP process.  Invitation to membership indicates that a security utility is present for NATO.  Of course, the criteria for membership is larger than the question of security utility.  Since the MAP cycles have been completed and accession (formal invitation to membership) occurred, it is highly likely that Montenegro will become a NATO member at the Warsaw summit in early July 2016.

In fall, while NATO officials were visiting Montenegro it seemed that momentum for opposition to NATO and Djukanovic was building.  Protesters were demanding a referendum on NATO, elections, and end to corruption,including the end of Djukanovic.  After their visit,  NATO officials made many encouraging but conditional statements about Montenegro's readiness to join NATO.  I was of the opinion then, and continue to be, that NATO officials wanted to encourage Montenegro/Djukanovic, but also wanted to see progress in the area of rule of law, reduction in corruption, and new elections, and that an invitation to membership would not be extended, but promised if certain conditions were met.   Then, just prior to the December NATO meeting, Russia started to get really vocal about its opposition to Montenegro becoming a NATO member.   My sense is that THAT pushed Stoltzenberg into doing what he had not intended to do:  offer Montenegro an invitation of membership.  He said as much.  He said that Russia had no business interfering in NATO affairs, that its interference was having the opposite effect than Russia wanted.  So, I think that Montenegro's NATO membership invitation was not so much a statement of Montenegro's readiness, as it was a statement by NATO that it would not be bullied by Russia. So, now, what will NATO do with Montenegro?  Since Montenegro wasn't fully ready for NATO membership, and shouldn't perhaps have had an invitation extended to it recently, the accession process now will have to be used to complete the process of becoming ready that should have preceded the membership invitation.  This will make the accession process longer rather than shorter.  The timeline for EU membership is instructive.

In December 2009, Montenegro was granted a Membership Action Plan, the final step in an application for membership in the organization.[1] A formal invitation was issued by the alliance on 2 December 2015, beginning the final accession talks[2] which could be concluded by the Warsaw summit in July 2016.[3] So, if the timetable is followed, or delayed by up to six months, we should anticipate a positive result.  Based on that, I'm starting high - say 80%, baring any sort of disaster. Looking at recent other applicants, Albania and Croatia both took around a year between their invitation to join and their full membership ratification.  This should take a big chunk off, however as pointed out by @fifty-sixty (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/69719), this is a slightly different situation, combined with the fact that elections occur in 2016, will put quite a bit of pressure on this.  Reducing by 25% to 65% From the inside view, locally, views on joining NATO are conflicted:  A poll in July 2015 from the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, which receives financial support from NATO, found that 36.6 percent support membership, to 37.3 percent against.  However, there is still significant forward momentum, so I'm not putting too much weight on that.  63% final tally.

Looked through sources linked by @clinton, didn't find anything forcing to change my mind. It's two questions: (1) what is possible timeline for accession talks, culminating with signatures on the protocol and (2) what is possible timeline for ratification of this protocol in 28 legislative bodies. All other steps are presumably short. For the first question I have very strong bias telling me that\n\t- the decision is made and the talks will be technical. \n\t- Nothing in current situation warrants any prolonged discussions. \n\t- Nothing in \"normal\" (i .e. predictable) flow of things, including relations with Russia, troubles with elections, modest protests, etc., has almost no effect on these talks. All this was already factored in when decision was made to invite Montenegro. NATO will continue monitoring, but as long as things develop along foreseeable path, there will be no delays.\n\t- Accession to EU is totally different topic in this case. Albania and Croatia joined NATO in 2009, Croatia is EU member since 2013, Albania is still only official EU candidate. Montenegro EU accession target of 2021 is irrelevant.\n\t- All bets are off if during the talks some unpredictable stuff happens, coup, failure to agree regarding elections, or something like that.  So I am predicting that the talks will be technical and it will take about 2-4 months to finalize the protocol. Would say that I am 80-85% certain that the protocol will be signed by the end of March 2016. Looking from the other side - I think there's 15-20% probability that something bad happens influencing the \"normal\" accession procedure. Ratification timeline: assigning 80-85% probability that IF the protocol is signed by the end of March, it will pass all 28 parliaments by the end of 2016.

Plus some days for final accession documents. Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia: invitation 11.2002, protocol signed 03.2003 (+4 months), last ratification 03.2004 (+12 months). In both cases accession talks were quite short, protocol signed in 3-4 months. Looks like the number of participants has not too much influence on this time, so Montenegro might be expected to reach the protocol on similar timeframe, maybe in 2 months, as they are really eager and alone in the process.  Ratification is a different issue. In 2003 it took 2 days (!) for Canadian government to ratify the protocols, Norwegian parliament used 2 weeks and French Senate 10 months [1]. Of course, ratification of 2004 enlargement was slightly different, as in 2004 spring several Eastern European countries were also admitted into EU, so some parliaments probably passed NATO/EU treaty amendments in package (don't know this, speculating).  In case of Estonia (as acceding country) the accession was scheduled to coincide with EU accession in 2004, so from technical point of view I guess it might have been quicker. Last 2 months, of the total 12 for ratification, was used by acceding countries. What I want to say here is that the 12 month for ratification is probably not very good number to base our forecast on. So purely technical case here is 2-4 months for talks/protocol and 6-10 months for ratifications. 8-14 months in total, counting form invitation. This elaboration does not account for possible delays in accession talks, don't know if there are any outstanding issues possibly delaying the protocol. In previous cases the talks have been technical. NATO Summit is held on 8-9 July 2016, 7 months and 1 week after the invitation. If we see very quick talks and protocol signed by the end of January, it may be signal that there is a pressure to finish the  process by the Summit. Wouldn't hold my breath for that. Elections in Montenegro are scheduled for 21 October 2016, almost 11 months after invitation. Basically the same time as with the last (Albania/Croatia) accession. If I were the king of Montenegro, I would probably do anything in my power to secure the NATO membership before elections. So given that (A) we have just one acceding country, (B) who seems to be in a hurry and (C) closing the case is technically possible before the end of 2016, I am optimistic.

The bbc article in qn description also cites current expectation of \"about 1 year\" I am tempted to think this will take longer than a typical expansion if it happens at all, because I believe montenegro will be a pawn in NATO-Russian negotiations.  It's very clear from the news articles that Russia finds Montenegro's joining NATO to be objectionable and it plans to retaliate.  Given everything going on in Syria, Iran and Ukraine, I would expect it to be in NATO's interest not to \"poke the bear,\" and rather to solicit Russian cooperation (as much as possible) on those fronts.  Accelerating membership more quickly is clearly more aggressive towards Russia.  If I am wrong, I would guess it means that cooperation is NOT going well, and 2016 Russia/NATO relations have deteriorated even further vs. where they are today (i.e. nothing left to salvage, so might as well go through with it). It sounds like this is a relatively divisive issue locally (per BBC article), but populace narrowly favors joining.  There is an election in October 2016 for the next 4-yr parliament (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Montenegrin_parliamentary_election).  That could presumably kill chances, but it does not seem likely to cause inclusion to be accelerated into 2016 if it would otherwise not be (i.e. seems unreasonable to think they would hurry it into the first part of 2016, and once election happens, timing is not a factor).  So watching this as a potential deal-killer, but I don't think local factors would push timing into 2016 vs. 2017. All-in, base rate data suggests odds of ~33%.  I am adjusting this down because a) I don't think it's in NATO's interest to accelerate it during a time when they are trying to extract cooperation from Russians, and b) I don't think it can be accelerated before Montenegrin election in Oct. 2016, and some chance that election could scuttle chances altogether.
