Because of all this NATO's \"street-cred\" has gone down quite a lot, so NATO could benefit if someone invoked Article 4 (let alone 5) and become more relevant again - which would be a threat for Russia!\nThe Ukraine-conflict seemed to change all that - for a while, with a sharp increase in NATO's relevancy in today's world.\nNow, NATO as an organization is much more relevant to the small eastern European powers, because they still face the traditional threat of bordering Russia and for a short time only, their pleas were heard internationally.\nIf for only one minute, it would be generally accepted that NATO member states would NOT react forcefully, all-out(!!!), when Russian troops cross the border of a NATO member-state (let's say a baltic state, because of civil unrest or because terrorists are believed to hide there or there was an attack on a Russian radio-station just across the border;-)), NATO would be DEAD. Therefore I suspect, that Putin sending troops to Syria serves one main purpose: Open up a new front, distract from the Ukraine-conflict and thereby undermine NATO further. Putin has succeeded with exactly that: Because Europe themselves are not able to carry out any meaningful action in Syria and the middle east, they HAVE to live with Russia being an ally for the time being. However Because of this alliance (or tacit acceptance of the situation, if you will), western Europan countries will carry out NO actions whatsoever in and around Syria with NATO forces or NATO-lead, hell, even involving NATO-HQs. Moreover I am convinced they will block any such endeavors (that is: involve NATO) by the US or eastern-European states. To come back to the point at hand: NATO Consultation in general is rare and in this context even more so, because firstly many nations believe NATO to not be relevant to new security challenges and secondly it has to potential to put the western-European allies to shame (lack of military capabilities, need to align to Putin's policy) and because of the situation of Russian troops in Syria. So there is only one way that I expect consultation might happen: An eastern-European power might call for consultations to bring the anti-terror-fight to NATO as a sort of a wildcard move because they understand what Putin is up for.
