So we are going to have to combine a  bunch of datasets to be accurate about this.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOutside View :\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBiden is up currently by 3.9 points on average when all the opinion polls are being averaged together [1]. There are currently 1.38 Million Registered Republicans in Arizona, 1.29 MIllion Democrats, and 1.2 Million Undecided Voters [2]. Off all of those people only 75 percent showed up in 2016 [2]. In 2016 Trump  was up by 4 points in the polls [3]. However Trump only won by 94,000 votes [4], which isn't that much.  ~~~~~~~~~~\nInside View:\n~~~~~~~~~~ Arizona has an elderly population of about 15.8 percent of the population, of that percentage over 7.7 percent of the population of voting for Trump. Given that the Trump administration is botching the recovery of it the Coronavirus, I see that percentage of voters changing. So let's call that maybe 6.7 percent of the population will vote against Trump, and absentee voting starts in October for Arizona.  Given the large population of Independents in Arizona, 58 percent of independents disapprove of the job that Trump has done. Furthermore, Independents in Arizona are willing to vote for Biden at a rate of 55 percent, while only 38 percent are voting for Trump [6].  Given that voting is starting in Two Months of Arizona, assuming if things go perfectly for the administration that they could clean up the Coronvirus by then, which the changes are lower than 5%. The swing votes are more likely to start coming in for Biden earlier than they are for Trump so it seems more likely that Biden will win.  1. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/\n2. https://azsos.gov/elections/voter-registration-historical-election-data\n3. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_clinton-5832.html\n4. https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/18/more-arizona-voters-didnt-equal-more-votes-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/93805952/\n5. https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/arizona/demographic-statistics\n6. http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NBC-News_Marist-Poll-AZ-NOS-and-Tables_202007231249.pdf\n"], [91695, "2020-08-02T14:19:23Z", [0.52, 0.48, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2020-08-02T07:20:42Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [94750, "2020-08-01T21:11:36Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], "Liberal state.
