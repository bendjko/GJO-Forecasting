In my initial prediction, I also assumed that the UK would not be partaking in the EU elections, but it is shaping up to be one more British EP election.

Reasons, why to vote according to the piece, are the Climate question and European safety issues, that cannot be solved as a nation. According to the article, in the 2014 elections, the startling difference was between 18 to 24 yo Finns 10% voted, versus Swedes 66%! Germans 29% and Italians 45%, EU average was 28%. So, what I'm reading into this, is, on the European level, the group that see EU as a good thing, do not bother to vote, and those who oppose it (Brexiteers and other nationalists elsewhere) do also not bother or stay at home as a protest, as it is perceived as anti-democratic, curved-bananas lawmaking or otherwise do not understand the whole complex system. The ability to grow the mobilisation of voters though the bank will be one of the key issues to this question. Question: How much is this old news and how much of this was present at the 2014 elections and before, and on the other hand, what forces are new and relevant to this years' voting? In this sense, the question for me is more and more a 60/40 versus 40/60 issue and thus much more subtle than the binomial outcome. Interesting puzzle.

Below are the major reasons explaining my point of view:  -\tSince 1979 the voter turnout has been decreasing from 61.99% to 42.61% (the results of the elections of 2014). However, between 2004 elections (45.47%) and 2009 (42.97) the decrease was 2.5% and the same number was reduced to only 0.36% between 2009 and 2014. Hence, drastic changes cannot be expected for the 2019 European Parliament elections. -\tNowadays there are several major issues that will encourage the voters to participate in elections. According to the report \u201cpublic opinion in the EU regions\u201d, analyzing the surveys carried out in the member states of the EU, states that the EU citizens claim that the major concerns facing the EU are: healthcare system, unemployment, the education system, the environment, immigration, crime, economic situation and people and/or business going away from the region.  Even though some of the problems have been in place in 2009 and 2014 as well, the survey indicates that the difference between the survey conducted in 2012 and 2015 isn\u2019t that big. Hence, there are problems that are still significant in the lives of the EU citizens, even though some of the issues that had been identified before have been improved. Additionally, I would add topics like Brexit, the tense relations between the EU and US and the EU and Russia as drivers to participate in the European parliament elections. -\tThe whole process of Brexit has brought into the spotlight the importance of the European Union. I might be too optimistic, but I believe that the EU citizens won\u2019t allow the voter turnout to be the lowest now and will demonstrate sympathy/loyalty towards the union.

There had been suggestions that dissatisfaction over the lack of Brexit progress would mean a drop in support for the Conservative Party, but that the voting would be a proxy poll on Brexit and turn out would be higher than normal as people would made Brexit protest votes/  In the event turn out has on average been at about the same level as most local elections; it appears to have been a bit higher in places where there is a majority for Remain and lower in places where there is a majority to Leave. Some commentators have explained this by saying that there was no obvious party for Leave supporters to vote for, while there were two parties that's policy was to Remain (the LibDems and the Greens). They say that UKIP is no longer a viable party, and so Leave voters did not vote for it and it only fielded candidates in 25% of constituencies.  \nWhile its true that the Brexit Party, which did not put up candidates in the local election, is now more popular than UKIP (but of course got no votes) this seems more like an excuse than a reason. Only a month or so ago UKIP (the original Leave party) was polling at 11% and presumably was considered by 11% of voters to be a credible party, the fact that it put up fewer candidates and has lost most of its seats is more to do with its Leave message being unpopular with people who actually go out to vote. This supports the view that Leave voters are now not very motivated to actually vote. The LibDems and the Greens got a lot more seats in this local election than previously which tends to show that Remain voters are (as suspected) more motivated to go out to vote. \nObviously a local election has in theory nothing to do with Brexit, the government or the EU, but in practice people tend to vote for parties. So the Conservatives and Labour parties lost a lot of support in the local elections because voters were not happy with their handling of Brexit.\nOne other factor that is difficult to establish the implications of is that there was also a large increase of \"independents\" elected (e.g. candidates not running on a party ticket), Its difficult to know why people voted for the independents without knowing what they all said their manifestos were. Most that I have seen were about dissatisfaction with local services, about the political parties ignoring voters and tended to be more right wing than left wing. My guess (and the numbers lost by Conservatives and won by Independents) is that they were voted for mainly by former Conservative Leave voters, so that might well be where many of the Leave supports went. So how will this affect the EU elections? There will be two more significant parties taking part in the EU elections; ChangeUK a Remain party and the Brexit Party for Leave. The question is will their presence  increase turn out or just take votes away from other parties that took part in the local elections? My guess is that the Brexit Party will mainly attract voters who in the local election voted for UKIP, Labour,  the Conservatives or those who voted Independant and a few people who did not vote in the local elections thereby raising the turn out figure a little. ChangeUK will mostly attract people who voted for the LibDems or Greens in the local elections, but also some votes from Conservative and Labour Remainers (who don't like the LibDems and Greens). I don't think it will attract very many people who did not bother to vote in the local elections. Because most voters will think any MEPs elected will make little difference and that the only point of voting at all is to protest against or support Brexit I expect the vote share of the Conservative and Labour Parties will be even lower than they were in the local elections.  The overall outcome is likely to be a small rise in the turn out in the UK for the EU elections, which is likely to be cancelled out in other EU countries as the decline in turn out continues.

This will surely affect turnout by Labour Party Members and supporters for the EU Parliamentary Elections. \nThe Labour position is that it will support a Public Vote on a Conservative version of Brexit, but will not support a Public Vote on a Labour version of Brexit. I don't know if Labour voters will have spotted the logic of this. A Conservative version of Brexit could only pass the UK Parliament if the Conservative Government was able to get a majority of MPs to back it. If a majority of MPs had just voted thru a Conservative version of Brexit those same MPs would hardly be likely to then vote to first hold a Public Vote on the deal that they have voted for. If the Government had got its Brexit Bill thru Parliament the UK would leave the EU, which means it would be too late to hold a Public Vote on it.\nIf somehow the Conservative Government could be persuaded to support a Labour version of Brexit and there was a majority of MPs who would vote for it, then according to the Labour Policy there would be no need to have a Public Vote. \nSo a \"Conservative\" version of Brexit would be opposed by Labour, who would demand a Public Vote. If there were enough MPs to vote it thru it would not matter what Labour demanded because it would be passed anyway without a Public Vote. If there were not enough MPs to to pass the Consevative version of Brexit it would not happen and so no Public Vote is needed.  \nSo in short the Labour policy is pointless because Labour would never have the number of MPs to demand a Public Vote on a Conservative version of Brexit that was able to pass in parliament.\nAs 2/3 of Labour voters support Remain, and up to 80% of Labour members are in favour of a Public Vote on any Brexit deal, the cunning plan by the Labour leadership to try and appeal to Leavers by saying they would like to push thru a Labour version of Brexit, and to appeal to Remainers by saying that it might be possible to avoid Brexit by having a Public Vote on a Conservative Brexit, does not really work. Many of Labour Leave voters might have been happy with the Conservative Brexit, which Labour is ruling out. And most of the Labour Remain voters will be upset because Labour is ruling out stopping Brexit. \nSo its clear that few Labour voters would get what they want, so why would they bother to vote for Labour candidates for the EU Parliamentory Elections? \nTheir logical choice is to vote for a party that clearly supports Brexit or a party that clearly supports Remain or to refrain from voting at all.  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48099901"], [37651, "2019-04-30T16:47:32Z", [0.18], ""], [62808, "2019-04-30T15:35:39Z", [0.01], ""], [70427, "2019-04-30T10:32:50Z", [0.72], ""], [72627, "2019-04-30T06:32:25Z", [0.15], ""], [172, "2019-04-30T01:12:37Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-04-29T22:01:25Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2019-04-29T18:59:47Z", [0.12], ""], [72727, "2019-04-29T14:48:55Z", [0.05], ""], [72688, "2019-04-29T14:37:28Z", [0.1], ""], [59316, "2019-04-29T09:55:42Z", [0.0], ""], [72713, "2019-04-29T06:23:33Z", [0.17], ""], [60723, "2019-04-28T16:00:41Z", [0.45], "Admittedly, my view is from across the pond, but it seems the expense of bureaucracy outweighs the benefits.

See there for more details, however, in short: Brexit might have shown both advocates and opponents of the EU that this election matters. One of my arguments was that the traditional low voter turnout in the UK and its relatively big population would fall away due to the fact that - from my original point of view - the UK would have not taken part in these elections. Thus, the likelihood of record low decreased. However, now it seems that the UK will participate.

The highly politicized Brexit will most likely increase voter turnout on the island. Furthermore, arguably, the chaos aligned with Brexit and the dramatic consequences for the UK most likely will lead to a higher voter turnout on the continent as well, due to the fact that more people consumed EU related news in the context of Brexit. Voters that did not care so far about the EU and its parliamentary elections might have realized its value now - or respectively, came to the conclusion now that Brexit might be a good idea and want to use the EU elections to support corresponding aspirations.

The general turnout has been decreasing since the first EU parliamentary election in 1979. From a participation rate of 61,99% in 1979 to 42,61% in 2014 (an -31,3% decrease in total).  This might seem high but shouldn\u2019t be overemphasized regarding the actual slowly and steadily decreasing turnout development in the periods of 1979 to 1994 with -8,6% and from 2004 to 2014 with -6,3%. It shows that the actual turnout decline rate itself is decreasing. Furthermore, it almost came to a halt in the period from 2009 to 2014 with only a -0,01% decline of voters participating in the EU election. There are two periods which represent exemptions. Between 1994 and 1999 there is a peak decline of -12,6%. This could be explained through Austria\u2019s, Sweden\u2019s and Finland\u2019s shared scepticism about an EU membership, thus, representing an extreme case. The other major decline is between 1999 to 2014 with -8,2% within 4 years. The reason may be the largest expansion of the Union by welcoming 10 new members (in comparison of 1 to 3 new members in between elections). Some of the new members represent former Soviet republics which may explain the low turnout from these countries due to their lack in experience to hold democratic elections, as well as the unfamiliarity to/lack of trust in such elections by its citizen. However, again, this drop should be seen as an extreme case which doesn\u2019t apply for the upcoming election. To conclude, regarding the fact that the trend almost stopped and that there was no expansion of the EU, it is unlikely that there will be a drastic drop in the voter turnout. The last decrease of merely -0,01% means that the trend could even change for the first time in the EU\u2019s history.  To assess if this might happen, the forecast at hand will estimate if the voter turnout in each member state is likely to increase or decrease by examining various aspects. First of all, the past development of each member states\u2019 voter turnout will be consulted in order to estimate the likely future progress. Second, it is important to assess the awareness of the upcoming election as this is a variable which reflects the possible participation rate of European citizens across the EU. The used data is from the \u201cParlamenter 2018\u201d poll\u2019s questions QA8 \u201cHow likely are you to vote in these elections?\u201d (the 10-point scale will be summarized in this way: 1 to 5 = unlikely to participate in election vs. 6 to 10 = likely to participate in election) and QA7 \u201cHow interested or not are you in these elections?\u201d. In absence of data from previous surveys this variable will solely be based on the 2018 survey data. Third, the overall opinion of EU citizens towards the European Union will be assessed by using the Eurobarometer\u2019s variable \u201cImage of the European Union\u201d and its results in the last 2 surveys (03/2018; 11/2018). This forecast assumes, that voters who give the EU a bad rating are less likely to attend to its election as going to the polls is connected to costs (time spent, distance to ballot, etc.). The group \u201cNeutral\u201d doesn\u2019t allow for any clear estimation if voters in this group will participate or not (the group: \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d will be excluded). Another aspect would be the public support of an exit referendum in their respective countries. Unfortunately, the Eurobarometer variable \u201cMembership to the EU\u201d cannot be used due to missing updates (last update was in 2011). National polls concerning a referendum support cannot be used neither due to the lack of data for some member states. However, the \u201cParlamenter 2018\u201d-survey contains relevant data in question QA3s through asking citizens how they would vote if a referendum would take place the next day (only the answers for leave and remain will be included). This approach is interesting as it allows us to assume that citizens who support an exit-referendum likely won\u2019t participate in the EU election due to participation cost. For this purpose, only the leave and remain votes will be counted. Again, this forecast will use solely the 2018 data due to the absence of this question in previous (and relatively recent) surveys. Another examined aspect in this forecast addresses the potential combination of national general or local elections with the EU election. The underlying rational is that combined elections decrease the threshold for the EU election and, as a result, increase participation. Additionally, it will be checked if states have a compulsory voting policy for the upcoming election. It\u2019s effect on the turnout has to be estimated based on country specific circumstances. A future update of this forecast might include the voter turnout base rates for the respective national/federal elections in each member state. It wasn\u2019t initially used due to its low priority in comparison to the used variables above as national/federal elections apply to other voter dynamics than supranational elections due to their proximity effect on voters.  Each countries likelihood to increase or decrease its voter turnout will be categorized in 5 labels: a) Very likely to decrease; b) Likely to decrease; c) Stable; d) Likely to increase; e) Very likely to increase. The detailed assessment of each state can be found below.  Number of States with likely or very likely decreasing voter turnout (combined number of registered voters): 5 (65,5 Million registered voters)  Number of States with a likely stable voter turnout (combined number of registered voters): 6 (109,6 Million registered voters)  Number of States with a likely or very likely increasing voter turnout (combined number of registered voters): 17 (216,9 Million registered voters) Overall conclusion: The general election turnout almost stopped its decline with a merely -0,01% in 2014. This forecast analysed the likelihood of each country\u2019s voter turnout to remain, increase or decrease in order to assess if the general EU trend will remain or change its direction. As a result, it seems very unlikely that the next EU election will set a new low record with 17 states likely increasing their voter turnout, as well as additional 6 states remaining a stable level, against 5 states who are likely to decrease their voter turnout. Involving the constituency size of each bloc clarifies the situation further. The combined bloc of states who will likely increase or remain their turnout results comprises of 326,5 Million registered voters in comparison to the 65,5 Million registered voters\u2019 bloc which will likely decrease its turnout. That is a ratio of almost 5:1. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that all voters in a state\u2019s constituency will go to vote, but it indicates the underlying dynamic of expected voter participation across the European Union. In the case that all countries categorized as \u201cstable\u201d will decrease their voter turnout the constituency comparison changes to: 216,9 Mil. vs. 175,1 Mil. registered voters. In the case that countries who are only \u201clikely\u201d to increase will fall into the \u201cstable\u201d category the number relation changes to: 99,4 Mil. vs. 65,5 Mil. (or 175,1 Mil.) registered voters. This represents a very high threshold of conditions which have to happen before a new low record will be realized. As a result, the likelihood of such a new record is assessed to be only 5%.  (Annotation: the sub-conclusion may speak of (e.g.) Austrians which implies that the data displays all voter opinions in Austria. However, the used data below is derived mostly from surveys and polls and, thus, doesn\u2019t allow for such generalizations. The use of generalizing language merely represents a simplification in order to minimize the overall length! Nonetheless, the conclusions are based on survey and poll data.)   AUSTRIA: Very likely to increase - It is very likely that voter turnout for Austria will increase regarding the average increase of participation (+4,8%), the relative high likelihood to go to vote stated by survey respondents and a majority who is interested in the elections. Additionally, Austrians seem to be unwilling to support a referendum and their image of the EU is fairly high (also increasing by 11%). \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (42.43%) -> +8,34% -> 2009 (45,97%) -> -1,26% -> 2014 (45,39%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 62%\nUnlikely to participate: 37%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 57% \n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 41% \n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (36%) -> +11,11% -> 11/2018 (40%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (38%) -> -2,6% -> 11/2018 (37%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (25%) -> -12% -> 11/2018 (22%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 54%\nLeave: 20%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible BELGIUM: Stable - The high number of citizens who plan on going to the polls isn\u2019t surprising due to the compulsory vote (which makes the effect of combined elections redundant). Only 71% interviewees stating that they will go to vote, as well as the lack of interest in the election, are indicators for a possible decrease. However, an overwhelmingly opposition against a referendum (72%) and the decrease of anti-EU-opinions support an increase. These arguments combined with the slowly decreasing trend in voter turnout indicate that the participation rate will remain the same (or will decrease insignificantly as in 04/09 & 09/14).  \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (90,81%) -> -0,46% -> 2009 (90,39%) -> -0,83% -> 2014 (89,64%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 71%\nUnlikely to participate: 29%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 43%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 57%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (40%) -> +2,5% -> 11/2018 (41%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (38%) -> +5,3% -> 11/2018 (40%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (23%) -> -21,7% -> 11/2018 (18%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 72%\nLeave: 12% \n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Possible (federal and regional elections)\n\u2022\tCompulsory voting BULGARIA: Very likely to increase - The trend isn\u2019t encouraging to forecast an increase of the turnout. However, more respondents answered to participate in the vote than citizens went to the poll for the 2014 election which indicates a potential for a growing participation. This potential could also be based on the increased number of voters who grew up in the EU and who identify themselves as Europeans. The good image of the EU combined with a disapproval for leaving the Union are further strong indicators for an increased EU euphoria. Furthermore, Bulgaria introduced a compulsory voting in 2016 which supports this assumption. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (n.a.) -> 2009 (38,99%) -> -8,08% -> 2014 (35,84%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 58%\nUnlikely to participate: 35%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 41%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 57%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (57%) -> -1,8% -> 11/2018 (56%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (25%) -> -8,0% -> 11/2018 (23%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (13%) -> +30,8% -> 11/2018 (17%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 54%\nLeave: 17%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible\n\u2022\tCompulsory voting CROATIA: Likely to increase - There are a lot of indicators who support a stable or even decreasing voter turnout. Nonetheless, regarding the low turnout in 2014 combined with the overall fairly good or neutral view of the EU and a majority opposing a referendum should represent a realistic potential that more Croatians will go to the polls. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (n.a.) -> 2009 (n.a.) -> 2014 (25,24%)\n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 48%\nUnlikely to participate: 51% \n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 46%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 54%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (34%) -> +14,7% -> 11/2018 (39%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (47%) -> -10,6% -> 11/2018 (42%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (17%) -> +5,9% -> 11/2018 (18%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 51%\nLeave: 18%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible CYPRUS: Very likely to decrease - Nothing supports an increase forecast except a minor upswing of the EU image and a majority against a referendum. However, the overall image of the EU remains mainly balanced and the support for a referendum is higher than the EU-average. Furthermore, the stated willingness of citizens to go to the polls, as well as the number of interested citizens, are almost similar to the actual turnout in 2014 which indicates a low potential for a growing participation rate. The strongest argument for a decrease is the abolishment of the compulsory voting in combination with an already strong declining trend in EU participation. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (72,50%) -> -18,07% -> 2009 (59,40%) -> -25,98% -> 2014 (43,97%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 50%\nUnlikely to participate: 49%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 48%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 52%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (34%) -> +5,9% -> 11/2018 (36%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (41%) -> -2,4% -> 11/2018 (40%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (25%) -> -8,0% -> 11/2018 (23%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 55%\nLeave: 26%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible\n\u2022\tFormer compulsory voting abolished in 2017 CZECH REP.: Very likely to decrease \u2013 A very low historic voter turnout which declined by -35,51% between 09/14, 78% of interviewed Czechs stating that they aren\u2019t interested in the election and a growing anti-EU-opinion all indicate that less citizens will participate in the upcoming EU election. There might be not a strong support for a referendum, however the remain camp is low compared to other EU states. That 40% of respondents stated that they will go to vote (which is higher than the last election turnout) seems irrelevant regarding the other factors.  \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (28,30%) -> -0,28% -> 2009 (28,22%) -> -35,51% -> 2014 (18,20%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 40%\nUnlikely to participate: 58%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 22%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 78%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (31%) -> -9,7% -> 11/2018 (28%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (38%) -> +5,3% -> 11/2018 (40%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (30%) -> +6,7% -> 11/2018 (32%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 45%\nLeave: 23% \n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible DENMARK: Very likely to increase \u2013 A high willingness to go to vote (despite a lack of interest in the election) combined with the possibility that the national and EU elections will take place at the same day are supporting this estimate.

Nonetheless, the overall development since 2004 remains positive due to the peak in 2009. The low absolute participation rate in 2014 (36%) combined with a moderate willingness to participate and interest in the election indicate that there is a potential for growth. This is backed by the improving image of the EU and the strong opposition against a referendum.  \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (26,83%) -> +63,62% -> 2009 (43,90%) -> -17,49% -> 2014 (36,22%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 58%\nUnlikely to participate: 39%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 45%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 53%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU stated by respondents:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (42%) -> +9,8% -> 11/2018 (45%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (45%) -> 0% -> 11/2018 (45%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (10%) -> -10% -> 11/2018 (9%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 67%\nLeave: 13%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible FINLAND: Likely to increase \u2013 This estimate is based on the stable turnout trend and relatively good image of the EU combined with a high willingness to participate and a strong rejection of a referendum. The latter two aspects set the tendency in favour for a minor growth. The lack of interest in the election puts the stated willingness into perspective and support the assumption that the change in the turnout should remain modest.

However, the high level of intended participation is contradicted by the lack of interest. Also, the EU has a terrible image in Greece. Nonetheless, this bad image doesn\u2019t lead to a strong support for a referendum which may imply that Greek citizens disapprove the EU in its current state but don\u2019t neglect the concept in general. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (63,22%) -> -16,78% -> 2009 (52,61%) -> +13,99% -> 2014 (59,97%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 62%\nUnlikely to participate: 36%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 44%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 56%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (26%) -> -3,8% -> 11/2018 (25%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (36%) -> +8,3% -> 11/2018 (39%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (37%) -> -5,4% -> 11/2018 (35%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 59%\nLeave: 23%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Possible (local elections)\n\u2022\tCompulsory voting, but no penalties for absence HUNGARY: Likely to increase \u2013 the overall historic trend suggests that less Hungarians will participate in the next election.

A high number of people responded that they will go to the polls which may be a result of the combined EU and local elections. The overall image of the EU is very good with only 8% stating otherwise. This is backed up by the low level of support for an Irish referendum to leave the EU. Especially regarding the implications to Ireland through the Brexit may lead to a moderate EU euphoria which wasn\u2019t the case between 2009 and 2014 when Ireland had to fight against the late causes of the 2008 financial crisis. As a result, it seems likely that the trend will turn positive. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (58,58%) -> -0,10% -> 2009 (58,64%) -> -10,57% -> 2014 (52,44%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 72%\nUnlikely to participate: 26%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 58%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 40%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (65%) -> -1,5% -> 11/2018 (64%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (27%) -> +3,7% -> 11/2018 (28%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (8%) -> 0% -> 11/2018 (8%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 83%\nLeave: 7%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Possible (local elections) ITALY: Likely to decrease \u2013 Almost every aspect in the data seems to speak for a decline of the voter turnout in Italy. The historic trend has been steadily declining since 2004. The rise of anti-EU-opinions as well as a weak majority against an Italian referendum seem to support a continuation of this trend. The high willingness to participate combined with the actual interest in the election likely won\u2019t be enough to hold a (relatively high) turnout result of 57%. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (71,72%) -> -9,30% -> 2009 (65,05%) -> -12,04% -> 2014 (57,22%)\n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 66%\nUnlikely to participate: 31%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 52%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 46%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (35%) -> -2,9% -> 11/2018 (34%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (38%) -> -5,3% -> 11/2018 (36%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (23%) -> +17,4% -> 11/2018 (27%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 43%\nLeave: 23%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible LATVIA: Likely to increase \u2013 This assumption is based on the seemingly contradicting results below. A (increasingly) good image of the EU in Latvia and a high willingness to vote are nullified by the actual interest in the election and the overall declining historic trend. Nonetheless, there seems to be a slight tendency for an increase due to the low turnout in 2014 which leaves enough room for potential growth, especially regarding that the Latvians overwhelmingly want to remain in the EU. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (41,34%) -> +29,90% -> 2009 (53,70%) -> -43,69% -> 2014 (30,24%)\n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 60%\nUnlikely to participate: 39%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 45%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 55%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (39%) -> +7,7% -> 11/2018 (42%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (47%) -> 0% -> 11/2018 (47%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (13%) -> -30,8% -> 11/2018 (9%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 66%\nLeave: 12%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible LITHUANIA: Stable \u2013 The last increase of the voter turnout may mislead to the conclusion that this trend development will continue, but it should be put into perspective regarding that it may only represent a recovery to the old level from 2004.

The data shows high numbers in willingness to vote, interest, strong opposition against a referendum and an overall good opinion about the EU. However, at such high levels of participation small decreases have a disproportional impact on the overall trend. With this in mind the data looks different: not enough stated participation intentions, relative low level of interest and an increase of anti-EU opinions among the constituency. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (91,35%) -> -0,65% -> 2009 (90,76%) -> -5,74% -> 2014 (85,55%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 63%\nUnlikely to participate: 34%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 55%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 41%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (54%) -> +1,9% -> 11/2018 (55%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (32%) -> -18,8% -> 11/2018 (26%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (13%) -> +38,5% -> 11/2018 (18%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 83%\nLeave: 7%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible\n\u2022\tCompulsory voting MALTA: Stable \u2013 Almost the same situation as Luxembourg.

On the other hand, the relative stable historic trend without a compulsory voting policy and the high amount of people stating that they will go to the election, as well as a relative high interest, make a decrease unlikely.

The reason lies in the low results from the last years and the potential of a growing participation due to an increased pro-EU tendency.

However, an increase in pro-EU opinions, also indicated by a firm opposition against a Slovenian exit, should be able to reverse the negative trend. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (28,35%) -> +0,07% -> 2009 (28,37%) -> -13,46% -> 2014 (24,55%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: 52%\nUnlikely to participate: 46%\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: 43%\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: 56%\n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (36%) -> +11,8% -> 11/2018 (38%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (46%) -> -6,5% -> 11/2018 (43%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (17%) -> +5,9% -> 11/2018 (18%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 63%\nLeave: 16%\n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible SPAIN:  Likely to increase \u2013 The main arguments for this assessment are the stated willingness to participate, a relative stable voter turnout with relative high results (EU comparison), an improved EU image in Spain and the strong rejection of a Spanish referendum.

Its relatively big constituency might have a decisive impact on the EU-wide results. It is very likely that supporters of the \u201cleave\u201d-campaign won\u2019t participate. On the other hand, it may happen that supporters of the \u201cremain\u201d-campaign are more likely to go to vote as a form of protest. However, this represents a form of commitment which may be a too high threshold. A good reference seems to be the petition to stop the Brexit. So far, over 6 million citizens signed it. Despite this success it indicates that a big chunk of \u201cremain\u201d-supporters don\u2019t believe in the effect of these protest actions. As a result, it seems unlikely that the \u201cremain\u201d-camp will be able to activate the entirety of its support base regarding the fact that participating in the EU elections won\u2019t have any benefits in case of a Brexit. \n\u2022\tHistoric EU voter turnout-rate development: \n2004 (38,52%) -> -9,92% -> 2009 (34,70%) -> +2,59% -> 2014 (35,60%) \n\u2022\tQA8: Likelihood to go to vote stated by respondents:\nLikely to participate: n.a.\nUnlikely to participate: n.a.\n\u2022\tQA7: Interest in EU election stated by respondents: \n\u201cTotal \u2018interested\u2019\u201d: n.a.\n\u201cTotal \u2018Not interested\u2019\u201d: n.a. \n\u2022\tImage of the EU:\n03/2018 -> change: x% -> 11/2018 \n\u201cVery positive\u201d & \u201cFairly positive\u201d: 03/2018 (35%) -> +17,1% -> 11/2018 (41%)\n\u201cNeutral\u201d: 03/2018 (33%) -> -12,1% -> 11/2018 (29%)\n\u201cVery negative\u201d & \u201cFairly negative\u201d: 03/2018 (29%) -> -6,9% -> 11/2018 (27%)\n\u2022\tQA3: Support for Exit referendum stated by respondents: \nRemain: 51%\nLeave: 34% \n\u2022\tCombined with national elections: Not possible Sources: \n-\tEuropean Parliament (2018): Parlemeter 2018 \u2013 Taking up the challenge.

So the question is what would lead you to think that the trend was about to reverse?  There have been no new members since 2014 and no country has left, so its the same electorate. If the UK had left, as the UK has had a lower than average turnout in the past, it would be expected that the turnout would have been higher than if the UK takes part. I estimate that (other things being equal) that the UK not taking part would have raised the EU average by about 0,5% (the UK's turnout has been about 7% below the EU average and UK voters make up about 12% of EU voters) if these figures had applied in 2014 it would have raised the EU turnout above the 2009 turnout. So it could have been expected that something similar could happen in 2019 if the UK did not take part.  Countries other than the UK have EU issues, particularly regarding immigration from outside the EU and dispersal of immigrants (and asylum seekers) between EU countries, but my feeling is that EU voters do not see a very direct link between EU policies and MEPs. EU voters tend to see national elections and national governments as having more influence on EU policies than MEPs do. (I found that in 2016 many UK voters denied that the UK had taken part in the 2014 European Parliamentary Elections. I imagine in other EU countries with low EU election turnouts voters are similarly indifferent to who is elected to the EU Parliament. )   I have not noticed a greater interest among people in EU (excluding the UK) in the 2019 EU elections than in 2014.  That said the trend curve for turnout does make it appear that the low point could be close (2014 to 2019 the drop was only 0.36%).\nSo the question does seems to be of how likely it is that the UK will take part?\nThe UK will take part unless the Brexit WA is carried thru the UK parliament before 23rd May. I don't think that Mrs May will get the DUP and all the ERG section of her Conservative Party to vote for the WA and even then that might not produce a majority, so it would need Labour MPs to vote for the WA. The current talks between Labour and Conservatives appears to me to be a sham. Over the weekend some detail of what exactly was being discussed was made public. \nRegarding the most important issue; future trade the discussions appear to be almost exactly the same wish list that is in the Brexit Political Declaration. i.e. a customs arrangement, that's like a customs union, but is not a customs union, that gives completely free trade with no tariffs or quotas, or rules of origin restrictions between the UK and EU, some sort of closeness between the EU single market rules, that does not stop the UK having different rules if it wants, but at the same times are accepted by the EU as being the same, has no freedom of movement, and allows the UK to conduct its own FTAs with 3rd countries. I am sure anything agreed would include lots of warm words like \"hope\", \"aim\", \"close to\" \"desire\" \"objective\". Presumably this wish list will \"hope\" to solve the Irish Border issue. To me this just sound like more magical thinking. If what is being described was implemented what would stop the UK doing a FTA with (say) China so that China could export car parts tariff free to the UK and then the UK re-export them to the EU tariff free, quota free and rules of origin free? Or a FTA with the USA so that the UK offered a backdoor route get US agricultural products into the EU (via that open border with Ireland).  Agreeing such a Political Declaration might look like Brexit progress by is unlikely to appeal to Labour MPs, because they know that the UK government has done all it can so far to avoid allowing parliament to have a say in Brexit, and once a Brexit WA is passed by parliament there is nothing that would prevent the government agreeing any EU trade agreement it wanted without parliament having any say. (Parliament only got a say over the WA because the Supreme Court forced it.)\nNote: parliament has not had any involvement in the trade agreements that Liam Fox has been doing to replace the FTAs that the UK will lose (with 3rd countries) when the UK leaves the EU. Fox has said his intention was to just \"roll over\" existing FTA between the 3rd countries and EU, but that has not been possible and the FTAs between the 3rd counties and UK will be different to ones they had with the EU.  So there is no guarantee that parliament would be able to block or change a FTA between the UK and EU post-Bexit. So Labour's leverage comes now before the WA is passed, after the WA is passed is too late. I assume they can see that and will not agree a blind Brexit. \nSo my conclusion is that the UK will not agree the WA before 23rd May and will take part in the EU elections.\nWhich brings us to the turnout change in the UK. I think other forecasters are right to be skeptical about poll answers on how likely people are to vote in these elections. Without going in to all the evidence it seems that Pro-Brexit supporters are less likely to see the EU parliamentary as a \"must vote\" occasion than Anti-Brexit supporters (Anti-Brexit demos and online petitions have attracted around ten times the support of Pro-Brexit ones). Many voters who habitually vote Conservative or Labour will not agree with their parties EU policy (or non-policy) some (maybe as many as 50% of them) will switch their vote to a clearer Pro or Anti Brexit party, but just as many will not bother to vote at all. The EU elections are seem by most UK voters as a rare chance to vote for the party that has policies you agree with, rather than the usual case in first-past-the-post where you vote for the party with the policies you think will cause the least harm.

Nigel Farage's launch of the \"Brexit Party\" has guaranteed an interesting ideological struggle around these European elections that will increase UK turnout in EU elections (one of the larger EU countries) as the closest thing the country will get to a \"redo\" of the Brexit vote. News coverage of this will be beamed to TVs across Europe making the election more \"top of mind\" for media companies and for people across Europe. Under similar conditions, US elections recently reached far higher levels of turnout than those observed a decade ago. \n4. Polling data is showing that the fiasco of Brexit has already caused other Europeans to view the EU in a more favorable light, which will act as a counter balance to electoral apathy, at least for the timeframe of these elections. \n5.

The perception that the EU parliament is relatively impotent as a body will continue to act as a drag on these positive turnout trends, however, as previously noted, 43% may represent an apathy \"floor\", so this is probably not enough to actually drag turnout lower, it just means that trends that could push it higher will have less of an impact than we've seen around other controversial elections (e.g. Clinton Trump). In other words, turnout won't hit a new low, but it won't hit a new high either. \n8.

I think that this event could be interpreted in two opposite ways. On one side, would be likely for the Britain people who voted for the \u201cleave\u201d to practice abstentionism, in order to reiterate their position. This would cause a drop in Uk participation rate, influencing the whole European rate. On the other side, the people that voted for the \u201cstay\u201d will participate to the elections, included all the citizens that in the past might not show such an active participation to European election, increasing the rate.\nHowever, I believe the first factor is more influent than the second one, so I think it will drop the Uk EU elections participation rate (or, in the best case, keep it equal to the 2014 one), not increasing it.\n- In some European countries the parties that during the electoral campaign were claiming to get out from Europe or from Euro now are reconsidering their idea, because reality is always more complicated and implies more (bad) consequences than any populist slogan. Italian example: suddenly, the Lega leader Salvini proclaims that he wants to change the EU from the inside, not destroying it anymore. His declaration make me think that a lot of Italian will prefer to follow their  \u201d\u201d\u201dcaptain\u201d\u201d\u201d  and vote for him also in the European campaign instead of not voting at all. \n-->  this is why I\u2019m going to change my prediction of only 5% *Basic reflection about the populist party strategy\nIn my previous forecast I didn\u2019t predict the lowest rate of participation in the next elections, but I do predict a shift of votes from the PPE or the PSE (main historical groups) to the populist parties which could coalize in order to be represented. \nTwo days ago in Milan Salvini have announced the creation of a party called European Alliance of People and Nation, EAPN, (from the previous Europe of Nations and Freedom Group, ENF), which has the aim to merge the euroskeptical parties: the French Front National, the German AfD, the Polish PiS (Poland has a lot of seats in EU Parliament and is governing nationally), Croatian HSP, Scandinavian extremists parties. The Hungarian Fidesz, guided by Orban is still part of the PPE but is really courted by others euroskeptical parties, because Orban is very popular in its country and could gain a lot of votes. So, the technique is convincing big names to leave their affiliation to PSE or PPE and join this new front. However, being sovereign parties, all of them have somes in common but also a lot of difference (how to treat the immigration issue, relations with Russia and imposition of sanctions); so I\u2019m not sure about the fact that they will be really able to merge in a unique party with a clear programme.\nAlso, there are other populist parties that will remain outside this new hypothetical macro-group: the 5 stars movement is not frowned upon Lega alliance so is trying to find alternatives. But the hypothetical alliance with gilet jaunes has been rejected by the French movement, the UKIP can\u2019t be anymore considered valuable because of the Brexit, so.. basically M5S doesn\u2019t know what to do.

Finally, Spain will hold much more important important general elections on April 28, after holding 2 general elections back to back in 2015, 2016. There might be a little voter fatigue when the EU election come. \nLastly, the UK looks more and more likely to participate in the EU elections. Under the \"Flextension\" proposal of Tusk they would have to participate to the EU election. It is very likely that this week the EU as condition for a further short extension will ask for the UK to start preparing to hold EU elections. \nIt is not clear which way the UK participation rate will go compared with 2014.

So now the UK are officially planning to participate in the EP election, which I thought they wouldn't. But part of the application says that the extension should end before June 30th if a deal is agreed upon in the UK parliament. Judging by how messy things have been going until now, I don't see parliament suddenly agreeing on anything, but who knows really? If the UK end up participating, this poll from the end of February suggest that participation will be at 43%, which is actually higher than the participation rate in 2014 [1]. Asking people if they want to participate in something usually gives a higher rates than those who actually participate, so I'm not really convinced by that number.   As you might expect, the poll reports that there is a big difference between those who voted for remain vs. leave. The polarisation between remain and leave is confirmed by this poll analysis (which is from a remarkably good non-partisan website called whatukthinks.org run by something called \"The economic and social research council\".) Their analysis tells the story of increased polarisation on pretty much all EU related matters and that voters have become strongly attached to either side of the Brexit debate [2]. Based on the above, I think that it is more likely that we see a drop in UK participation rates or at best a similar rate as in 2014. So I am personally a little less confident in my initial forecast and I'm increasing my forecast from 20 % to 27 %.

In 2004 it reached 45,57% and 42,97% in 2009. In the last 2014 elections the result have been the worst, with an attendance of only 42,61%, but very similar to the 2009 results which doesn\u2019t make me forecast a huger declining.\t  https://www.wired.it/attualita/politica/2014/05/23/elezioni-europee-affluenza/ http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/election-results-2014.html\nThe lower and lower turnout level could be due to a lack of efficiency and action power perceived by the populations, especially after/during episodes like the economic crisis in 2008 and the refugee crisis. In my view, a huge role is played by the populist anti-European parties that have raised in the last decade in Europe, spread everywhere and founded consensus at the national elections. Those parties have often depicted EU as an enemy that would cared more of bureaucracy and elites than to common lay people, spreading angriness, dissatisfaction and disappointment. Moreover, the recent Brexit referendum and the rise to power of similar movements in other big countries (Trump in USA, Bolsonaro in Brasil), have somehow legitimised those positions.\nHowever, after having hit bottom in 2009 and 2014, I think that this year turnout wouldn\u2019t reach the historical minimums. Even the EU does not good well yet, currently there aren\u2019t emergency situation such as in 2009 or 2014. What I forecast instead is a massive flow of votes for anti-European parties: instead of not voting at all, the populations would prefer to vote them aiming to change EU from the inside and asking their politicians to \u201ctake back national sovereignty\u201d, even stopping the process of integration (which already had a setback after Lisbon treaty in 2009, with no more structural treaties).\t\u201cWhile there are significant divides between them on substance, anti-European parties could align with one another tactically in support of a range of ideas: from abolishing sanctions on Russia to blocking the EU\u2019s foreign trade agenda, to pulling the drawbridge up against migration. This would put at risk Europe\u2019s capacity to defend its citizens from external threats at exactly the time when, given global turmoil, it needs to show more resolve, cooperation, and global leadership.\u201d https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/scorecard/the_2019_European_election On the other side, the pro-Europe citizens would feel the urgency of contrasting the rise of euro-sceptics, going to vote for the opposition.\nTalking about the Brexit issue, there is evidence of the complexity of getting out from EU without suffering bad consequences and of the fact that EU has un upper hand on the topic. This discourage the idea of leaving the Union and empower EU credibility.\t  \nAdditionally, a lot of countries are going to vote for National elections at the same time of European ones, pushing citizens to vote for both.\t\nFinally, EU is doing a massive campaign to teach the youngest electors the importance of European policies, using modern path as youtube, social media, bloggers support. These actions will likely increase the number of voters in elections.\t \nTherefore, I predict a low level of participation but not the lowest.\n"], [67798, "2019-03-07T09:29:53Z", [0.85], ""], [67429, "2019-03-06T18:06:51Z", [0.05], ""], [67415, "2019-03-05T13:10:47Z", [0.65], "changed the previous forecast to account for increased perceived increased campaigning.

It is in fact true, that the EP elections voter turnouts experienced a constant downwards trend. However, it has to be noted that compared to the 2009 elections, the voter turnout in 2014 were only 0.36% lower (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/de/turnout.html). This difference is rather small and considered too small for this forecast to anticipate a further decrease based upon that, in particular given the fact that the long-term downwards trend (almost 20% between 1979 and 2014) got promoted (among other factors) strongly by the expansion of the EU toward the east where voter turnout has been traditionally lower than in the western countries (https://www.kas.de/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d3b13d4c-81ad-5926-f2eb-d41cbc81f95b&groupId=252038 and https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-turnout/). Since there was no further enlargement since the last elections this factor can be excluded.  Arguably, a too narrow extrapolative focus on this question is furthermore rather counterproductive because it would ignore crucial changes in the context, in which the 2019 EP elections are embedded in. In the aftermath of the 2014 elections many analyses referred to the second order election effect. According to this explanation, EP elections would be perceived as less important and interesting by the electorate than their national counterparts. Therefore, voters would often either not vote or use the vote as as vote on national matters, e.g. to punish their government (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/politics/cbl/int/ele/acsecor.htm) However, the forecast at hand argues that this has changed due to a different political environment, where the EU receives much more attention than it did in the past. Two events in particular are perceived as crucial by this forecast: Brexit and the refugee crisis. The Brexit might have shown both advocates and opponents of the EU that this election matters. The aligned increased media attention in combination with the realization that a further integration is not axiomatic might motivate mobilization and a higher voter turnout on both sides. In the same token, the refugee crisis might mobilize many former non-voters to vote this time, particularly promoted by a broad range of populist parties that put the refugee crisis in a decided EU context (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/26/populists-immigration-orban-salvini-law-eu-elections). In both cases it has to be noted that in particular populist parties increased voter turns outs in many former national elections in the EU due to their ability to get back non-voters (https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/fileadmin/files/BSt/Publikationen/GrauePublikationen/ZD__Studie_Populismusbarometer_2018.pdf). This increase in the meaning of the EU in public attention could be already observed by many national elections throughout the last years, where Europe became the central topic, instead of being a side note (e.g. Macron\u2019s 2017 campaign). Building on these changes in the political context of the elections, Europe will be more present among voters and thus more interesting for them. Additional factors decreasing a record low voter turn out probability are the comprehensive and sophisticated electoral grassroots elections campaign by the EU Parliament (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/elections-press-kit/2/this-time-i-m-voting) and the withdrawal of the UK before the elections - a country with a low EU parliament voter turn out and large population (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/de/turnout.html).

I can imagine the following socio-political shifts influencing voter turnout: 1. Brexit has increased conversations about the EU - further interest from the general public might be reflected in higher voter turnout from a newly engaged European electorate, particularly among younger demographics. 2. Rising Euro-scepticism across Europe: this might discourage turnout or encourage protest votes. More likely to discourage participation as perceived as \u201cpointless\u201d. 3. If Britain delay Article 50, the UK electorate might be eligible to vote in the EU elections. I can imagine this would go one of two ways. British people might feel that, with Brexit still expected, the EU elections are an irrelevant waste of time. This would drag the voter turnout down. However, Britain could use these elections as a quasi-referendum, pitting remain candidates against leave candidates. Leave voters would be desperate to ensure Brexit still goes ahead, whilst Remain voters would see an opportunity to prevent Brexit. As the Brexit referendum itself achieved a high turnout, I imagine such a quasi-referendum also could. I believe that number 3 is quite unlikely, but I will reassess after the Article 50 deadline has passed and we know whether Britain partaking in the elections is a possibility at all.\n"], [1333, "2019-03-02T19:26:05Z", [0.47], ""], [67411, "2019-03-02T16:06:05Z", [0.2], "1.

Even though it is visible that there has been a clear decline in the turnout since 1979, one of the explanations could be the enlargement of the EU and the new members who, regarding of a few exceptions, are tend to participate less actively in the EU elections. \n3. In case of an extension of Article 50, the UK still has a right to hold an election. However, it is very unlikely that the UK would decide to use it. Therefore, taking into account that the UK's turnout is always below the EU average, it could also increase the overall percentage of participation. \n4. Regardless of many discussions and doubts about what will happen with the EU after the Brexit, now it is fear to say that the EU is seen as the winner in this situation. It is hard to tell how it impacts public opinion and participation in the EU elections but I am quite confident to say that EU image looks quite well taking into consideration Brexit, as well as managed migrant crisis.  Despite the arguments expressed before, I do not believe that turnout will increase sharply this year.

Recently though the EU has taken a great step in promoting the EU and getting awareness with the younger generation. Programs such as the 'thistimeimvoting.eu' campaign are very visible on online platforms, or the hashtag #EUandME has been introduced, creating more awareness among the 'Social-media generation'. Also for the elections now, the EU is taking an effort, e.g. recruiting popular bloggers to promote the EU elections. Hence, it can be assumed that voter turnout for the younger generation could be proportionally higher than the last couple of years.  > Further claims for low voter turnout was the fact that the EU seems so far away and their impact is not clear. Campaigns such as the 'What Europe does for me' website however shows explicitly the impact the EU makes. Additionally, frequent the 'Future of Europe' protest have taken place in many EU cities, bringing the European idea closer to its citizens.  > Lastly, the EU seems to matter more looking at the issues that EU citizens are concerned with. Whilst in 2014 these were economic situation, unemployment, EU countries public finances, immigration, rising prices/inflation (in order), now the top issues are immigration , terrorism, economic situation, public finances, unemployment. The two most important once hence are clear transnational issues that cannot be solved by the national governments and very much rely on EU governance ( https://www.politico.eu/interactive/european-elections-most-important-issues-facing-the-eu/). So, the EU seems to be more important in governing the top issues from which a greater voter turnout can be predicted.  > Lastly, a poll by the EU asked EU citizens in spring 2018 about if they believe their voice matters in the EU, where 48% voted with yes, which are already more than the 42% from 2014 (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/en/be-heard/eurobarometer/eurobarometer-2018-democracy-on-the-move).

Rather, a number of considerations led me to this conclusion: -The 2014 Election set a record-low 42.61% also because of the particular historical moment when they took place. Indeed, 2014 and the years before represented the end of many traditional parties in the European continent, leading in some countries to the definitive end of the conventional left-right distinction. In the following years, many new parties have gained importance and at the next European Election, they will attempt to convince their voters to sustain them also at the European level.   -Support for the EU is \u201cthe highest score ever measured since 1983\u201d according to the Parliament Eurobarometer. -The fact that Europe faced (and is still facing) a wave of populism does not automatically mean that this will turn out in fewer people to vote. In fact, if populists want to change (or destroy) the EU as they usually sustain, they need before to take control of its institutions. For this reason, also populist parties are likely to undertake a strong and intense political campaign. In doing so, they could bring a vast number of people who did not vote in 2014  to the pull for the first time.  -Finally, Brexit negotiating has been giving a lot of visibility to the European Union. All newspaper over Europe keep talking about the issue and try to forecast how it will end.

Also, the second-order nature the EU elections have in comparison with national elections can be important: with the European migration crisis and the uncertain developments in the Brexit deal can drive people to a lower attention to communitarian issues. \nAnother outcome is more probable, in my opinion. There could be a 50% probability that the voters' turnout will be not meaningfully decreased in comparison with the 42.61% of the 2014 elections. This can be explained through multiple factors. The very increase of populist parties in Europe does not necessarily imply a lower turnout in the European elections, it could also lead to a wider representation of these parties in the EU Parliament. Furthermore, as often European elections are used by electors to give their national leaders signs about their satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their internal politics, many voters can seize the oportunity to give a clear message. If this outcome will happen, there is a strong risk of misleading interpretations: the stable turnout - far from being a good sign - must not be explained with a revival of the European belonging feeling, but with the previous explanations. The reasons which explain the 45% probability of a lower turnout are also the ones which explain the reason why I give only a 5% probability to a higher torunout. I cannot exclude a surprise - a record Italian turnout to support the Lega in its migrations policies, a record UK's turnout deriving from an unsuccesfull Brexit process, etc - but I am not induced to thik that the historical decreasing pattern of participation will end in 2019. \nSources: most of all the ones indicated in the forecast's question + \nGaspare Nevola, Democrazia, Costituzione, Identit\u00e0, 2006 "], [34376, "2019-02-25T13:50:39Z", [0.35], ""], [41922, "2019-02-24T22:37:45Z", [0.05], ""], [67423, "2019-02-24T18:22:34Z", [0.15], "While voter turn-out in the European elections have been on a downwards trend, there is reason to believe that this will not continue with the 2019 election.

Secondly, the EU has featured as a major talking point across different European countries in the light of events such as Brexit and border closings.

If Europe did not necessarily go round in 2014, in 2019, these questions can be expected to arouse more curiosity this time around. For instance, the recent local environmental movements in several European countries lend us to think that there will be more investment on such issues from the citizens, at the European level.

In sum, there are strong indications that the voter turnout for the 2019 European Parliament elections will not supplant the record of 2014.  10% YES: However, one wants to keep a reserve, although small : 10% is for letting the doubt surface. The European Union is a generally divisive issue, and although Europeans can vote for eurosceptic parties,  the tendency is not to feel close enough to the federal system to take part of the European elections. The risk of foreign powers interfering in votes can also discourage Europeans from voting and giving their voice.

On the contrary, eurosceptics through a protest vote will manifest this position very strongly. Eurosceptic partys take the vote more seriously than partys with a broader base. The Hungarian populists (turnout of 28.97% in Hungary) and Polish (turnout of 23.83% in Poland in 2014) will try to have a bigger place in the parliament and will therefore encourage their voters, always more numerous from day to day, to support them to overturn the pro-eu majority in the Parliament. Italians too will have a greater desire to express themselves with the advent of Salvini.\nThe protest voting theory also shows that voters use peripheral polls to punish the holders of central power in the home country (Mair 2004). In addition, in my opinion: The turnout will probably increase in France due to the very popular protest of the \u00a0\u00ab\u00a0Gilets Jaunes\u00a0\u00bb (theory of the protest vote here) but also with the strong support for euroscepticism (the Front National head polls for May 2019).

(But if the country remains in the EU this could push the setting of the record, because the British will not care to send elected in an organization in which they will leave, thus the abstention will be total). Croatia with one of the lowest rates of turnout, will surely see its rate increased, because the country was not even in the European Union for 1 year when the last European elections arrived.

I would argue that particularly in the more populous countries of Europe, politics have been very tumultous, or extreme, in the past few or couple of years, which means people in general are perhaps more aware and talking about politics than they would have a few years ago, and due to Brexit the same may be the case for EU politics.
