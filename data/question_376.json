I assume the question is aimed at the \"sin\" aspect (e.g. Soda drinks are not good for you, so a tax that puts people off buying it is a \"good\" thing.)

In the UK the similar tax is being added on the sugar content, which is in addition to the standard rate of VAT that is already added to food stuffs that are not considered necessities.

Meanwhile, in New York and elsewhere, lobbyists and public officials are looking to duplicate the dubious policy. When it was passed last year, Philadelphia became the largest city in the nation to create a specific tax for soda and sugary beverages, a policy that had previously been contained to progressive enclaves like Berkeley, California. The tax is levied at a rate of 1.5 cents per ounce, which makes it 24 times more expensive than Pennsylvania's taxes on beer.\nhttps://reason.com/blog/2017/01/05/soda-tax-sparks-outrage-in-philadelphia 2.Soda tax Soda taxes are slowly sweeping the nation. The Navajo Nation decided in 2014 to imposed higher taxes on sugary drinks and \u201cminimal-to-no-nutritional value food.\u201d Special taxes on sweetened beverages took effect in Berkeley, California in January 2015 and in Vermont six months later. On November 8, voters in four cities approved proposed soda taxes, and two days later, the Cook County Council did the same. Philadelphia\u2019s soda tax takes effect on January 1, and similar taxes take effect in Boulder, Colorado, Oakland, California, and Cook County, Illinois on July 1, 2017. Pundits predict more cities and states will soon follow suit, now that soda taxes have been successfully enacted in these areas. Certainly there is interest. Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley has been calling for a tax on soft drinks for years and is likely to renew those efforts in 2017.\nhttps://www.calszone.com/2016/12/2017-sales-tax-changes-take-effect-jan-1/ 3.http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2016/12/31/the-5-best-worst-state-tax-changes-of-2016-plus-whats-on-the-docket-for-2017/2/#6063531f2fbe"], [32590, "2017-01-15T09:03:58Z", [0.1], ""], [32581, "2017-01-15T07:13:55Z", [0.6], ""], [32578, "2017-01-15T06:43:00Z", [0.1], ""], [13377, "2017-01-15T01:52:38Z", [0.8], ""], [368, "2017-01-14T20:22:03Z", [0.05], ""], [21800, "2017-01-14T15:25:33Z", [0.5], "Consensus is still below 20% on this one.
