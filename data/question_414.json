One could suppose that there would be another successful attempt to raise cash in 2017 or by 2nd quarter of 2018.  Is there a scenario where the pattern of initially not raising sufficient cash makes sense in the overall picture in Tesla's evolution and in what way does it make sense?

Apple took the outsourcing pathway to production and has been very successful.  In contrast, Tesla has opted for vertical integration for EV production but has not yet completed that integration in its manufacture of high energy density storage batteries.  Tesla's partner (and underwriter?) on the Gigafactory is Panasonic.  For the supply chain, Panasonic relies on Sumitomo Metal Mining.  And yes, I understand that the reality is that there are varying degrees of overlap of the two endpoints and the trend appears to be moving toward greater vertical integration for this particular entity. Lithium production appears to be the key link in the battery supply chain, or rather, that portion of the supply chain focused on cathode manufacture.  This portion is currently outside of Tesla\u2019s control.   Now, we can cast various plausible scenarios involving the dilemma posed by North Korea\u2019s insistence in being \u201cthe mouse that roared\u201d.  Others can figure out the probabilities of these scenarios but suppose military action is one outcome likely to occur.  What effect will that development pose to the supply chain and will that effect reverberate through the supply chain sufficient to pose a danger to Tesla\u2019s current business configuration? Ok, that\u2019s out there but so what?  My view is that we could say that there are some technologists out there who we could consider the new alchemists in that they\u2019re working on the age-old problem of transcending our primate nature.  That primarily involves new ways of thinking or man-machine integration.  (Media theorist, Marshall McLuhan in 1967 pointed out this integration as I'm sure others before him, e.g., Vladimir Vernadsky.  McLuhan referred to technology as extensions of the human body while for Vernadsky the emphasis was on something he called the noosphere.) The seed of the above thought experiment grew from the following article:  http://seekingalpha.com/article/4056248-lithium-evs-teslas-outsourcing-vs-toyotas-vertical-integration?app=1&auth_param=1dvndc:1ccpn5s:b97325622e131947d8b9f228386eed20&dr=1#alt2\n(Article title --Lithium: Tesla's Outsourcing Vs.

Then the traditional auto sales franchise system seems concerned that auto manufacturers could sell direct to customers.   Maybe Indiana will be a test case for Tesla and the franchise industry?  Perhaps one way Trump can incentivize plants to build more cars in the U.S. is to allow direct sales to customers and bypass franchise system (fair trade)?  What would be the consequences of of this?  Dealerships could fade away and auto shows could be more common?  What would this mean for Tesla debt? Tesla did build a plant in Nevada versus Mexico.
