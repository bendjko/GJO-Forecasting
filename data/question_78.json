A successful test of locks was conducted on Feb.14 and, on Feb. 15, it was announced that a major crack which further threatened the delivery date, has been fixed.  A dispute between the project's administrator and the consortium of companies behind the expansion over costs has been blamed for much of the delays -- the project was originally set at $5.25 billion, but the builders successfully argued for an extra $3.2 billion, of which the Canal Authority has paid $250 million so far.  The group of companies behind the project  announced last month that a  dispute to get the Canal Authority to pay them $17.5 million dollars for over budgeting and delays during the national strike in 2014, has been resolved.   President Valera said in January that the Canal would be inaugurated \"AROUND MAY.\"  With a year and half of delays, another push on that date would not be good for Valera's record.  He was elected for a term of five years.  The country's constitution prohibits him from running for a second consecutive term which takes the question of election year pressure out of the equation.

An objective assessment for a 15 May 2016 expanded Canal open will have greater predictability by mid April.\nThe expanded canal will open.  Nevertheless, what will be the catalyst to open before 15 May 2016? Expanded shipping lane demand may not necessarily be forecasted based on worldmaritimenews comments, \u201cShipping Confidence Continues Downward Trend\u201d [2].  \u201cOOCL Asia-Europe revenue slumps 32.2%\u201d [3]. Additionally, depressed oil prices offer alternative transports more attractive.  A brief look at DOW transports indicates a breakdown in technical patterns on daily, weekly and monthly charts.  Contractual obligations may be one of the few incentives for a 15 May 2016 open.  \nCulturally, Panamanians have less emphasis towards timelines, however, I\u2019m not sure how this will influence the completion date of the canal [4].

I don't know if there is anything related to a translation (or for that matter contractual terms) that posters have uncovered. Especially early when the question was listed and construction problems identified there was a great deal of discussion about what \"open to shipping\" meant. Without some further boundary conditions it could mean anything ranging from a \"we're open\" to a scull transiting to an actual transit of a PanaMax ship to 24 hour operations. Your guess would probably have been better than mine since I could probably grudgingly accept any of those. Back to the inauguration issue.

Any payment authorizations must go through five people who delay indefinitely, he said, adding that this is \"smothering\" the project. The problem has worsened since the new Panamanian government of Juan Carlos Varela took office because, Quarta says, the ACP has launched an exhaustive review of activities and projects inherited from the previous government of Ricardo Martinelli. \"After exchanging an endless number of questions and responses, we get to a hearing to deal with an (arbitration) claim ... the ACP presents new arguments ... forcing everything to be delayed,\" the GUPC chief said.

Still, the importance and prestige of this project suggest that every effort will be made to achieve the original schedule and the recent apparent confidence with the issue of the locks should enable this.\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/panama-canal-administrator-expects-new-locks-to-open-on-time-1444653273\nhttp://www.pancanal.com/eng/pr/press-releases/2015/12/01/pr567.html"], [12944, "2015-12-16T09:36:43Z", [0.65], ""], [12302, "2015-12-16T03:31:41Z", [0.5], ""], [10935, "2015-12-15T23:04:24Z", [0.6], "WSJ story 15 Oct is hopeful but hedging on April. 15 May gives 2 weeks.  \nIt's unclear whether \"open\" = \"not still being brought up to spec\"."], [12993, "2015-12-15T22:15:36Z", [0.75], ""], [12988, "2015-12-15T22:01:55Z", [0.75], ""], [12986, "2015-12-15T21:40:05Z", [0.15], "It's not the 1920s any more.

Starting in January 2016, extra rebar rods will be inserted into the lock wall and fresh concrete injected into the crack. \"Why is an apparent construction flaw being touted as a design problem? According to analysis by Eric Jackson, editor of The Panama News: \"If it is properly diagnosed as a bad concrete pour and properly resolved by tearing out the faulty concrete and redoing the work, that would cause major new delays and probably bankrupt construction companies\u2026 Calling it a design flaw allows for a quicker, cheaper and shorter-lasting fix and for those responsible for the bad concrete to litigate with designers in an attempt to pass off some of the costs of their mistake to others. \"Jackson speculates that the collapse of the heavily government-subsidised Spanish construction company Sacyr \u2013 one of GUPC\u2019s members along with Italy\u2019s Salini-Impregilo, Belgium\u2019s Jan de Nul, and Panama\u2019s Constructora Urbana \u2013 could bring down Spain\u2019s fragile economy. The timing could not be worse for the incumbent conservative government with general elections scheduled for 20 December. \". . .  news of further flaws surfaced via a memo by a US-British-Dutch consulting firm working for GUPC. According to a report published by La Estrella on 11 November, the memo cites the discovery of two new cracks in the sill. Elsewhere, unsubstantiated rumours abound of yet more construction flaws. \" . . .the APC has been reticent in divulging official information about the problems. . . .  On 18 November, it did release a . . .  Youtube video . . .

Quijano was in Miami to update executives...\n[...]\nQ. At the end of October, the canal expansion was 95 percent complete. What remains to be done? A. We\u2019re still working on some of the aids to navigation along the canal, but they should be finished very soon. Mainly it is work on the locks that remains. In September we finished the access channel that goes from the new Pacific locks to Culebra Cut. We\u2019ve also been testing the dam [that separates the access channel from Gat\u00fan Lake.] For the past two weeks the water in the dam has been at its highest level. Next we\u2019ll start draining the water back into Gat\u00fan Lake [part of the canal] and remove a plug. That should take about two months. There\u2019s also a lot of electro-mechanical work to be done and correction of a design problem on six of the eight sills in the new lock complexes. [During testing, water seepage was detected in a concrete sill between the upper and middle lock chambers on the new Pacific locks]. That should be finished in mid-January and then we\u2019ll retest it. In January, we\u2019ll determine the most likely date or range of dates for inauguration of the expanded canal.\n[...]\nQ. Do you still expect that the inauguration of the expansion will be in April? A. We haven\u2019t changed the April date, but it\u2019s not going to be April 1. We still need additional information from our contractor \u2014 mainly because of the repairs on the leakages that aren\u2019t expected to be finished until Jan. 15. We\u2019ll look at all the rest of the work that remains to be done to determine exactly when in April we\u2019ll be open. There\u2019s always the possibility that it might not be April, but it shouldn\u2019t be too much beyond that.\n~~~~~~ COMMENT: Two VERY BIG tidbits from this Q&A that I've included above. The first -- it looks like we'll have a better idea of when THEY think things will be done sometime in January. The second -- he's still expecting an inauguration in April. That sounds VERY promising to me, as I'd expect that if it were clear to the contractors that there was going to be a huge delay, that would have already been communicated to the ACP. Further to that, he does leave room for the possibility that it'll be beyond April, but \"not too much.\" Now, when he says \"not too much,\" is he talking in the sense of how close we already are to April or given the entirety of the project. I suspect that it's the former and as a result, that 15-day buffer in May (our question ends on May 14th at 11:59p), makes me think that there's a really, really good chance that this question will be wrapped up in the affirmative. Part of me wants to go to 100%, but I think I'll hold at 99% until we hear from the ACP in January.

Last news post on the site was in September 2015.  In the September post GUPC (Grupo Unidos por el Canal) verbally reported to the ACP (Panama Canal Authority) that April 2016 was stil the completions date.  The ACP is still awaiting GUPC's formal confirmation of the date.\n   Reinforcement of the 1st and 2nd Cocoli Locks, and the 1st 3 in the Atlantic facing Agua Clara Locks will be reinforced (as a preventative) as well as the leaking lock.  Further testing, and 1/20 th of the coverall construction is still unfinished.\n   ************ The site reports that GUPC is contractually liable for all corrections required to be made to the locks.  Since the contractor is responsible for the long term performance of the locks, it seems unlikely that GUPC would allow the locks to operate in a condition that would further degrade them thereby increasing future risk to the contractor. *********\n   Repairs will need to be followed by more testing....unions not 100% cooperative, actually gaining more leverage as the due date approaches.  Requests for outside inspection of the construction is also a risk to the completion date. Also the Miami Business Community received an update on the canal last week:\nRead more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/international-business/article48346215.html#storylink=cpy\nQ. At the end of October, the canal expansion was 95 percent complete. What remains to be done?\nA. We\u2019re still working on some of the aids to navigation along the canal, but they should be finished very soon. Mainly it is work on the locks that remains. In September we finished the access channel that goes from the new Pacific locks to Culebra Cut. We\u2019ve also been testing the dam [that separates the access channel from Gat\u00fan Lake.] For the past two weeks the water in the dam has been at its highest level. Next we\u2019ll start draining the water back into Gat\u00fan Lake [part of the canal] and remove a plug. That should take about two months.\nThere\u2019s also a lot of electro-mechanical work to be done and correction of a design problem on six of the eight sills in the new lock complexes. [During testing, water seepage was detected in a concrete sill between the upper and middle lock chambers on the new Pacific locks]. That should be finished in mid-January and then we\u2019ll retest it. In January, we\u2019ll determine the most likely date or range of dates for inauguration of the expanded canal. Q. Do you still expect that the inauguration of the expansion will be in April?A. We haven\u2019t changed the April date, but it\u2019s not going to be April 1. We still need additional information from our contractor \u2014 mainly because of the repairs on the leakages that aren\u2019t expected to be finished until Jan. 15. We\u2019ll look at all the rest of the work that remains to be done to determine exactly when in April we\u2019ll be open.\nThere\u2019s always the possibility that it might not be April, but it shouldn\u2019t be too much beyond that."], [40, "2015-12-07T01:18:19Z", [0.27], ""], [12585, "2015-12-07T01:07:11Z", [1.0], ""], [12582, "2015-12-07T00:19:30Z", [0.25], "There is a chance.

Terrific link!  Great photos.   \"The core sample photo shows concrete inadequately and improperly vibrated.  The 'waterfall photos'  definitely look like there's a cold-joint problem\", says my husband, Alaska's best retired carpenter.  \"This occurs when the bottom layer gets too set before another layer is poured and the vibrator isn't inserted far enough into the layer below, vibrated long enough, and removed slowly enough for all the air to bubble up,  to allow for proper mixing/bonding of the layers.    Adding steel rebar after the pour (as it sounds like they're doing) will make the joint stronger, but won't do anything to fix the leaks. The leaks will only get worse.   If this was a Corps of Engineers job, the contractor would be forced to replace the concrete!\" \"No wonder the unions are demanding an independent external inspection report!\" \"If this was just a retaining wall holding back dirt, adding rebar properly grouted in could be a fix, but it would be very tough to permanently water-proof such a fix, so the proper fix in this situation is demo-ing.  Before demo-ing could begin, the backside would need to be de-watered somehow.  There's no knowing how long it would take to get it de-watered; if it's necessary to build a coffer dam, it could take weeks to assemble the proper equipment and materials.\" \"Demo-ing, if there's no rebar in the existing concrete, might be fairly simple and straight-forward, taking days for crews like I used to work with.  The whole wall would need to go to avoid creating another cold joint. Then, rebar would need to be placed so that the new concrete is stronger and the locks would need to be ground free of existing concrete.  New forms would need to be built, and the concrete placed.  Depending on the size of the crew and if proper equipment is on hand for demo-ing, the demo-ing & re-pouring process would take a week at the very minimum.  Depending on the design of the mix, the concrete would take 14-28 days to come up to strength. \"All together, we're talking months to properly fix cold joint and improper vibration problems.\"   So, the questions are:  \n-will the inspection report white-wash the problems?  \n-will they decide to let the problems \"pass\" and decide to do a lot of pumping?\n-how will the administrators view the situation if a few ships go through but then the canal is closed for extensive repairs/upgrades? I'm going to go to 0 on this because \n-I hope that they'll do the right thing and do a comprehensive repair (demo & rebuild)\n-even a patch-job will take time\n-the unions may strike if the repairs aren't going to be properly done, which would cause a further delay.

Pictures of the leakage taken in August show a waterfall rather than the more typical dampness or seepage one normally expects. When such massive concrete is so porous, the only appropriate description would be \"a major failure\", given that the purpose was to hold back water.\nhttp://gcaptain.com/a-concrete-sample-was-pulled-from-the-new-panama-canal-locks-and-it-does-not-look-good/#.VkwlKHYrLcv I've been involved with concrete repairs in building structures, but the scale of this project is so much bigger than anything I've done that I'm hesitant to speculate. However, when one needs to strengthen a structure by adding reinforcement the usual option is to do it externally, either with steel plates or other material such as carbon fiber. When there is insufficient steel reinforcement inside a massive, custom-designed concrete structure, adding the required steel in the right place is not easy.  Demolition and reconstruction would do the trick, but I doubt if either the builders or the canal authority will want to do that. Yet another option would be to leave the wall in place, and thicken it with a new wall capable of resisting water pressures on its own. This would also delay the project significantly. However, right now I can't think of any other option that would address both problems - missing reinforcement and poor concrete quality - with any surety. Comparing with leaking concrete roofs, the points of entry of water from above hardly ever correspond to where the leaks are observed below, so \"patch\" repairs rarely solve the problem. Thus, injecting all the visible cracks and points of leakage with special chemicals (which the contractors may try)  is unlikely to be 100% successful, even after several iterations of injection and re-filling/testing, and they would still have to add the extra steel. I was hoping to find a report in one of the technical journals e.g. Engineering News-Record or New Civil Engineer, but a search of their websites doesn't show anything more recent than an arbitration award in favor of the contractor early this year. At this time, and until we learn more details about the Construction Consortium's proposals to rectify this problem, I'm going to start by predicting they won't complete repairs before the closing date of this question. However, with the Nicaragua Canal in mind, the expansion could be \"open to shipping\" on the promised date even before rectification  e.g. by using a lot of pumps! My forecast is therefore based on usage of the Canal rather than the likelihood of timely repair. Hopefully, the question will be considered resolved after the passage of a large ship rather than just an announcement by the Authority that they are open. EDIT: It occurs to me that if one section has been under-designed with insufficient steel reinforcement, have they checked whether any of the others have the same shortcoming, even if there are no visible indications?"], [11425, "2015-11-18T09:15:35Z", [0.25], "Best guide to future performance is past performance - delays seem likely with leaks"], [60, "2015-11-18T06:58:13Z", [0.81], "I'm going to be a little contrarian (vs. the crowd wisdom -- to date) on this question and jump in near the higher end.

Ninety-four percent isn't 100%, but it's on the way to being there. This article also talks about the invitations being sent to heads of state for the opening. Because I'm reading the translated version, it's not clear to me whether the invitations HAVE been sent or WILL be sent. Link 2: http://shipandbunker.com/news/am/857676-panama-says-cracked-lock-will-not-delay-opening (Oct 2) -- In this link, we learn that the contractor has only given a verbal indication that the opening will remain the same. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is still awaiting the formal report in writing. This is what some other forecasters have been referencing (i.e. wait for the formal report before making a more concrete forecast, no pun intended). The important point from this link: \"The ACP's statement supports findings from its international trade specialist Javier Carrillo, who in September said the opening would not be affected because time for repairs had already been included the expansion project schedule.\" ~~ Link 3:WSJ link from Oct 12 -- http://www.wsj.com/articles/panama-canal-administrator-expects-new-locks-to-open-on-time-1444653273 This article has a bit more detail from an ACP administrator on the details of the repairs:  \u201cThe contractors say the leaking locks won\u2019t delay the scheduled opening next April,\u201d Panama Canal Administrator Jorge Quijano told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cI still believe it\u2019s going to happen by then, but I will be able to say more once some of the corrections are done and I see in Panama all of the steel reinforcements, which at this point they are not. At present, I can only take the word of the contractors.\u201d \u201cIt took quite some time to determine what it was,\u201d Mr. Quijano said. \u201cThe contractors eventually came back to us and said that during the design they had not considered all of the stresses and that there was insufficient steel in some parts to absorb the water pressure.
