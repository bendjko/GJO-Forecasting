Ohio is a traditional swing state with President Obama taking the popular vote in the last 2 elections (2008, 2012), while current Governor John Kasich beat Strickland in 2010 and Rob Portman took his seat in the same cycle.  This would typically be considered a close election with Portman having a slight edge due to his incumbency (http://www.andreamoro.net/perm/papers/why_do_incumbent_senators_win.pdf) and that this election cycle would typically be seen as advantageous to Republicans (8 years of Democratic White House control and an average economic situation.  I will look at a few key variables in assessing this race: polling, fundraising/general campaign quality, candidate quality and potential coattails. These are not the only important variables but will serve as a good starting point. It is also important to realise that these variables are not equally valuable ie. Being ahead in the polls is more valuable than having more money in the bank. The key thing to remember here is that there is a long way to go until the election, that time period means there is significant uncertainty in any prediction; for this reason frequent updating and responding to new information is the best way to accurately gauge the result.  It\u2019s important to set a base level for our prediction. I generally think the betting/prediction markets are useful for setting this base but there is bit of a discrepancy on this particular race. PredictIt has the likelihood of Portman winning at around 44% (https://www.predictit.org/Market/1321/Which-party-will-win-the-US-Senate-race-in-Ohio-in-2016) while Predictwise, on their market prediction, has the odds at around 45% (http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-congress-senate). However PredictWise\u2019s overall prediction is 56% (when considering fundamentals and polling). I will average those to reach a base of 51% likelihood for Portman (this is also in line with the Cook Report and Sabato describing the race as a toss-up).  Polling:\nThe Huffington Post poll-tracker has Portman with a slight (2.5%) lead (http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-ohio-senate-portman-vs-strickland). The last three polls have all shown Portman ahead or tied (all polls conducted in June). In general this would be considered a good but not great position for an incumbent (compare to Ron Johnson being 10 points down in a similar race in Wisconsin). There are two issues with this lead. Firstly we are too far from the election for such a small lead to be hugely significant (this is the equivalent of being up a field goal at half time). The polling also has a large amount of undecided (nearly 20% in the most recent poll). It\u2019s possible to make arguments that these undecideds help or hurt Portman; I\u2019m not fully convinced by either so will call it a wash. \nOverall: It\u2019s generally better to be up 2% at this point that not and as the incumbent that advantage is probably even more so. I\u2019ll boost Portman up to 55% on this evidence and will continue to boost him if the lead holds over the next few months. Portman 55% Fundraising/Campaign quality:\nPortman has, and continues to have a large lead in money on hand. (http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/04/rob_portman_continues_fundrais.html). I\u2019m generally ambivalent on the importance of money on hand but this seems like a fairly clear advantage. In general the two campaigns seem fairly evenly-matched in other areas.\nOverall: I\u2019ll boost Portman 2% with additional boosts if his large lead in campaign money continues. Portman 57% Candidate quality:\nI think, in general, this issue only matters if one candidate is clearly a negative or huge positive. In this case there is evidence that Portman may be unusually weak as an incumbent with very low name recognition (http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/05/11/portman-strickland-senate-ohio-poll.html). However Strickland is also potentially weak with lots of voters knowing him and not liking him (based on his time as governor). I think this is basically a wash for now with the potential for movement if one candidate successfully weakens the other on a particular issue.\nOverall: No change Coattails:\nThis elephant in the room for predicting this, and indeed any race this cycle, is Donald Trump. The conventional wisdom is that Trump will damage generic Republican chances down-ballot due to his unpopularity and potential to bring out an unusually large Democratic turnout. I\u2019m open to this theory (although the evidence for a large coattails effect is limited), but it is also quite hard to quantify. There is little evidence that Trump is currently damaging Portman; Portman has gained in the polls during the last month while Trump\u2019s favourable have been going down. Until more data and information emerges I don\u2019t think we can consider Trump to be inherently damaging, however I do think he creates further uncertainty (ie. the chance of Trump damaging Portman is higher than the chance of him helping and that chance lowers Portman\u2019s odds). \nOverall: I\u2019ll knock Portman down to 54% due to the uncertainty (in a generic election year I\u2019d likely lift him a little). Again we need more information here before we can have much certainty. Overall I think there\u2019s reason to have Portman as the slight favourite, while clearly recognising there are two big uncertainties (time and Trump). The status quo clearly favours Portman so without significant change I will likely slowly lift Portman\u2019s odds while changes in either way will result in corresponding odds changes.

Where are we, where are we going, and how sure we are about our prediction. The best way to figure out where we are, imho, is polls.  That's actually the place to start.  We are at 50/50. Where we are going is based upon the candidate's head wind or tail wind.  What is the environment he/she is playing with?  This includes national party unity or chaos, the leaning of the underlying state, how good of a politician this candidate and his/her opponent is, how deep of pockets both have, whether there is a ceiling to their support, and whether said candidate or opponent is an incumbent. How sure we are should start at not very sure, but become more sure over time.  6 months out, there is plenty of fog of war.  2 days from the election, there may be much less confusion (it's the polls, stupid).  Start closer to 50/50 (even if there is reason to believe otherwise), move towards yes or no over time. In other words, what are the odds, and what are the error bands? OK, what are the numbers?

Mr. Trump has no high-dollar donor network and has given little indication that he is willing to tap into his fortune to give the party the hundreds of millions of dollars it will require to finance its campaigns in the fall.\n. . .\n\"In the 2012 elections, the R.N.C. raised more than $409 million. The party has raised $135 million this election, but what is deeply concerning to many Republican candidates, contributors and strategists is that it only had a little more than $16 million on hand, along with nearly $2 million in debt, at the end of March. Mr. Spicer stressed that this was partly because the committee had already begun paying to send staff members to battleground states, well ahead of the same time four years ago. \"But the party\u2019s modest cash availability underscores how much hangs in the balance with its nominee. The minute Trump gets the nomination, the party is going to have to raise another three or four hundred million,\u201d said Al Hoffman, a Florida-based Republican donor. . . .  Mr. Hoffman, a former R.N.C. finance chairman, . . .  said he had little appetite to raise money for a Trump-led party and would probably focus his efforts this year on helping a local House candidate and assisting the re-election of his friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. And he emphasized that he was not alone. \u201cAll the donors I\u2019ve talked to have said they want to sit out the presidential and just focus on the Senate and House,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \"Ray Washburne, a Republican fund-raiser from Dallas who also previously served as a national committee finance chairman, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big switch to doing the Senate races and trying to hold onto the Senate.\u201d \"Mr. Washburne said Mr. Trump, who has relied on mostly small-dollar contributors in addition to about $36 million of his own money, showed no sign of being prepared for the fund-raising demands of a presidential general election. \u201cThe Trump group has done nothing about putting together a finance team at all,\u201d he said.  . . .  even as donors have asked him . . . how they could help Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the hell to tell them to call,\u201d Mr. Washburne said. \"This sort of unease about Mr. Trump, along with the dislike many of the party\u2019s business-oriented donors have for the hard-line Mr. Cruz, has prompted the R.N.C. to begin privately assuring donors that it will create a so-called Senate Trust fund. Money earmarked for that fund will go entirely to initiatives aimed at retaining the Senate \u2014 including hiring field operatives and opposition researchers and bolstering digital efforts. . . . \n. . . \n\u201cThe unspoken concern,\u201d said Mr. Borges, the Ohio chairman, is that if Mr. Trump secures the nomination, \u201che, No. 1, won\u2019t participate in fund-raising for the party, and, No. 2, donors won\u2019t want to help the party if he\u2019s the nominee.\u201d  \u201cSo that would put a real damper on fund-raising in a number of ways.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The shift in focus in the RNC to fundraising for Senate races could make a difference in this race.

He had a strong lead in 2016 primary votes, as the GOP pulled more voters than the Dems.

A positive for Porman : Strickland has asked for 5 debates, but, Portman is a GOP favorite in preping candidates in mock debates against upcoming opponents.
