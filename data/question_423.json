If the jobs report is not consistent with forecasts, I will back off the forecast. 2) The Fed's recent history has been to use the media to threaten to change rate increases without actually doing anything.  This could be another example of \"jawboning\" (to revive a '60s expression). 3) Increasing this rate may have two important unintended effects.  It may strengthen the US dollar.  It will cost the US more to borrow money.
