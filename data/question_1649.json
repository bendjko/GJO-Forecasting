Hence, 0 probability of a Yes outcome.  Three reasons for this; a) this would potentially bring legal chaos into the EU as it questions which court has authority in EU, the ECJ or the national courts? Hence, the possibility of a collapse of EU treaties, and the potential undermining of the ECB's ability to provide monetary support (see https://bit.ly/3eZ5mWQ ) and b) the German Bundestag has confirmed to the Constitutional Court that the ECB's PSPP program does indeed satisfy the proportionality requirement stipulated by the judges (see https://bit.ly/39EB4Yj) Lastly, c) the German Contitutional Court could not instruct the ECB to make changes as it has no jurisdiction over the ECB. Judging by @ChristineLagarde, ECB President, comments (https://bit.ly/2EctEjU) on 7/7/20 the ECB seems convinced that the proportionality element of the German Federal Court has been answered by the Bundersbank, with supporting information from the ECB.

The court is looking for a document that acknowledges that some sectors in german economy will be negatively impacted but overall the german economy will make up those costs in other sectors benefitting.
