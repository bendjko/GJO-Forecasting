On the other hand, the data seems to fluctuate a lot per month, so that it seems likely that october was an outlier. Furthermore, last december was the month with the second lowest amount of accidents in the previous year.

(2017 and 2018 have more collisions in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year plus sales of EV's are increasing). This increase of collisions could just coincidence and there is not really enough data to establish a trend yet IMO.

Using quadratic regression (which resulted in an R value of .9782), 2019 should have roughly 110 traffic accidents. I ultimately decided that the number of crashes would be higher than this calculated rate, because both Waymo and GM Cruise are growing their autonomous car testing programs.  As of late October 2018, California is permitting Waymo to test unmanned autonomous vehicles, meaning humans won't even have to be in the cars during trials. GM's autonomous car program also received a $750 million dollar investment from auto-giant Honda in October 2018, which will go directly into developing and expanding their fleet of self-driving cars.   More cars on the road will increase the number of accidents, at least in the short run (in 2019).

Cruise, with testing centered in San Francisco, has the most vehicles permitted to operate in the state, with 175. The company had 109 vehicles permitted in 2017, according to state records. It intends to launch commercially next year. Waymo launched its commercial service with self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans last week in the Phoenix area albeit to a handpicked audience and with human safety drivers behind the wheel. But the company has reinvigorated its California efforts. The number of Waymo vehicles permitted for testing in California dipped from 74 in 2016 to 23 last year. But this year, Waymo has 121 self-driving vehicles permitted for California testing. Cruise and Waymo are primarily responsible for the increase in permitted test vehicles, but they're hardly the only ones. Apple, long secretive about its autonomous vehicle intentions, increased its number of permitted test vehicles to 72 this year from 14 in 2017.

In March, Uber was forced to drastically scale back its testing activities after an Uber vehicle hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona. The same month, a Tesla customer died when his Autopilot-enabled Model X car slammed into a concrete lane divider. Waymo hasn't suffered such a catastrophic event. But its long-promised December launch of a commercial service in Phoenix, called Waymo One, was a disappointment.

Two counteracting sets of forces: i) increase in miles driven and ii) increasing share of Non-waymo vehicles with higher accident rates VS. iii) improvements in miles per accident ~~~\nDiscussion:\n~~~ Accidents are a function of: [ miles traveled by company i ] x 1 / [ miles per accident by company i ] summed across all companies i. For simplicity, I divide companies by two categories: Waymo and Non-Waymo. This distinction serves our purposes because Waymo represents more than half of miles driven [1] and because there is a stark distinction between miles per accident for Waymo (much better) and other companies. Let's take all assumptions one at a time:\n1) miles driven: for simplicity I am looking at this number across all companies. It was ~650k in 2016 and ~500k in 2017. Given the exponential nature of this variable, a reasonable assumption may be that the number will double in 2018 and double again in 2019: i.e. 2 million miles in 2019. Caveat: companies moving to Arizona will put downward pressure on this number. 2) miles per accident: Waymo weighted average is around 48. Non-waymo weighted average is around 6 [2]. It is reasonable to assume some improvement. For now, I'd say 10% for Waymo and 150% for Non-Waymo given that they have a lot to improve.  3) company shares: We also have to assume how the shares of miles driven will change. I assume that non-Waymo will grow to 45% of miles driven. In 2017, Waymo was 70% [1] - I expect this number to go down but not by much given that Waymo maintains heavily invested and benefits from its past experience, which allows it to retain a dominant position at least in the short term. Result: 81 accidents.  Sensitivities: \n-the improvement in miles per accident for Non-waymo is an important variable. A 200% improvement drops the final number to 71.\n-miles driven is also very important. If we saw 3 million miles driven, the final number jumps to 121.\n-share of non-waymo miles driven is less significant but still somewhat important.

If Waymo or GM Cruise drop out of testing, then likely the number is in bottom brackets.  The number of accidents mostly will not depend on the improvement of autonomous driving.\nEven in 2017, most (? I did not review all reports, but I read some of them) accidents are caused by non-autonomous vehicles rear-ending the autonomous cars. Rear-ending cannot be avoided by better autonomous software apart from making autonomous car behave more predictably for humans. I doubt autonomous car predictability will improve sufficiently to avoid more than 10% of rear-ending accidents.\nOther significant percentage of accidents is autonomous car operating in non-autonomous mode.

Partially because the question is not well defined and partially because it is not a static situation. The question does not state what Level of autonomy we are judging. There are 5 levels from something like enhanced cruise-control to fully autonomous. There is also the vagueness in the question regarding \"testing\" autonomous vehicles versus consumer autonomous vehicles. For example, there are no Level 5 consumer vehicles on the road, but there are several companies testing Level 5 vehicles on the roads in CA. This is also a moving target. The number of accidents for 2017 might be radically different thant the number of accidents for 2019, because teh number of companies entering the market is increasing. And different manufacturers have different track records for percent of accidents reported. Google has few, BMW has more since they just got in the game. That said, I looked at the data I could find and I think the proposed answer possibilities are low. I think there is this idea that autonomous vehicles are never involved in accidents. But you have to consider accidents caused by other drivers as well. For example, autonomous vehicles notoriously hesitate when entering trraffic, and they get rear-ended a lot. That is an accident. The question doesn't state that the autonomous vehicle caused the accident. The below report link goes into depth about the correlation between miles driven and accidents, and if I could find more data about accidents in general in CA for conventional cars then I could provide a decent statistical number of expected autonomous accidents - with the assumption that \"autonomous\" in this question means any Level of autonomy.

A better question would be to break it into multiple question regarding different levels of autonomy or define a specific car, like Telsa Model 3 accidents."], [51175, "2018-11-18T15:22:15Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-11-18T13:06:45Z", [0.03, 0.16, 0.54, 0.2, 0.07], ""], [62773, "2018-11-18T00:57:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [62773, "2018-11-18T00:49:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [373, "2018-11-17T23:38:47Z", [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [35217, "2018-11-17T20:19:01Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15], "A naive estimation would look at: Miles driven / miles driven per accident reported and how those values are expected to develop in 2019. \nMiles driven:\nhttps://www.therobotreport.com/self-driving-cars-disengagements/\nWaymo (Alphabet's self-driving venture) had by far the most miles driven in 2016 and 2017, -44% less miles driven in 2017 compared to 2016, though. It looks like many miles driven will shift to Phoenix, where they plan to roll out their first commercial autonomous ride service. (https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/03/02/waymo-is-millions-of-miles-ahead-in-robot-car-tests-does-it-need-a-billion-more/#627ab2311ef4) Nevertheless, other companies will continue to test and probably ramp up their mileage, although they might be discouraged by what seems like Waymo being way ahead of the curve here. But since the companies playing catch up are both large (GM, Nissan) and potentially a few smaller startups, I think it would be reasonable to assume that miles driven in CA will be higher. For this forecast I would go with 1 million miles driven in CA as the lower bound, 3 million miles driven as the upper bound. This could also go significantly higher if commercial operations involving autonomous cars start popping up, so will have to keep an eye out for that. One thing that might need clarification in this question: Will only accidents reported in vehicle testing be included or would the count include accidents by commercially and regularly operated fleets?\nMiles driven per accident reported:\nThe PLoS One paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607180/) cites 40-54k miles driven per accident for Google's vehicles, see Table 2. Other companies do much worse with 3k-20k miles driven per accident. A pessimistic outlook for this parameter would be: \n- no progress from Google/Waymo, so they would remain at ~50k miles driven per accident. \n- the rest of the pack manages to catch up to the best from the paper, so the rest has an accident every 20k miles driven.\nAn optimistic outlook for this parameter would be:\n- Google/Waymo manages to beat the average of conventional cars in the US (500k miles/accident). Considering they want to launch a commercial service, they pretty much have to be measured by that standard in order to gain their customers' trust.\n- The rest catches up halfway, so 250k miles/accident. There is a fair chance they might get better even faster, as once a pioneer has led the way it's easier for competitors to follow, poach people who have know how from a project that succeeded, etc. This technology might be starting to take off exponentially, which is always hard to wrap one's head around in a forecast. Also let's also assume that half the miles driven in CA will be Waymo, and the other half will be the rest. So far, we then get:\nlower bound: 1M miles driven / 375k miles driven per accident --> 3 accidents (this sounds way too optimistic now) \nupper bound: 3M miles driven / 35k miles driven per accident --> 85 accidents Considering the DMV already listed 60 accidents in 2018 so far, we might get up to 70-80 in 2018 in total.
