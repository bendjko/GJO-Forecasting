Continuing. But the question isn't what the GDP growth will actually be, it's what China's government will report. The lowest annual number they have ever reported since 1993 is 6.1% which is widely perceived by economists (and chinese officials, apparently) as tending to over state GDP in downturns. So I'm going to assume that for whatever reasons there is big barrier to reporting numbers below 6 and an insurmountable hurdle to reporting numbers below around 4%.  Here's a lengthy quote from an recent NBC article: \"Thomas Rawski, professor of economics and history at the University of Pittsburgh whose research is focused on the development of China\u2019s modern economy, said it\u2019s widely understood by economists and Chinese officials alike that provincial data is \u201cno good.\u201d \u201cWhen things aren\u2019t going well, and we see this on both a national and provincial level, they publish data that show things are better than they are,\u201d he said. \u201cAssuming the best possible effort, it\u2019s just not easy to measure such a large economy. On top of that, there are also questions about whether there is an interest at all in actually reporting accurate numbers.\u201d Rawski has observed China\u2019s economic growth since before the Asian financial crisis around 1997, which is when he began to see the data run away from reality, he said. He published an article in 2001 that claimed data on manufacturing output was out of step with underlying figures on electricity consumption. \u201cThinking about the flu business, it is entirely the same as the GDP issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIn both cases, there are a lot of technical issues as well as what I call veracity issues. And there\u2019s the question of motivation of people collecting and reporting the data at all levels, and you have to ask is there an incentive to distort. I think the answer is obviously yes.\""], [40584, "2020-02-21T13:47:37Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0], "I'm aware that SARS cut \"only\" 0.5-1.0% off Chinese annual growth. Here's my thought process for Covid-19: \nThe number of deaths is best case, likely to be 4-5x higher than SARS in china by the end of the second quarter. It could easily be much higher. That doesn't translate proportionally to an economic impact 4x higher but is indicative of magnitude. My impression from news reports is that the reaction of the Chinese government is in fact more like 10x more impactful on the economy than their actions for SARS.  So let's say that the impact is 5x higher. That's between 2.5 and 5% off GDP. I'll call it 3%. It was a sharp drop followed by a rapid rebound, but the net result for the year was -1% or so.  I would assume that the bulk of the impact will be in Q1 assuming a hopeful/best case outlook for containment of the disease in China. So I'm going to assume 2/3 in Q1 and 1/3 in Q2. That would imply a ~8% reduction in Q1 and a ~4% reduction in Q2 to get to about -3% for the year. I'll say we're starting with about a 6% baseline.  So I'm going out on a limb here with a more contractionary prediction of -2 in Q1 and +2% in Q2. I recognize that's completely off the reservation from the predictions of professional economists, but frankly they have a track record not much better than random.  (BTW: Since China is 16% of world GDP and the second-largest importer, that implies around zero growth worldwide in Q1.)

Comparison class: Diamond Princess. Its passengers' 14 day quarantine, begun Feb. 3  is being prolonged to another 14 days beginning with the future date when they are evacuated and tested negative. The ship has been declared a high risk environment, with another 70 diagnosed today out of the 355 discovered so far. About half of the passengers have been tested so far, so the toll will undoubtedly rise. The onboard epidemic began with just one passenger, and he debarked in january only to later discover the infection. So, let's take this comparison class to illuminate today's situation in China. First of all, the impact of SARS cannot possible predict the impact of Covid-19. there are far more cases and the epidemic has caused far more quarantines. As of today, half the population of China is under some sort of lockdown. Armies of enforcers patrol the streets. In many areas, use of private cars is now forbidden. Small towns, even hamlets are cut off from each other. Almost all trade is shut down, just enough movement to keep people from starving and hospitals (we hope) supplied. How many of those high rise buildings harbor a Covid-19 carrier? Are the conditions inside these high rises similar to a cruise ship? The apartments are tiny, and we don't know whether  ventilation systems are spreading the virus. What about all the closed factories? How soon  will the virus be eliminated or at least slowed enough to open factories, resume trade? Another comparison class, each year's new seasonal flues, which attack sizable percentages of the world population. On the other hand -- Xi will lie about the GDP. He as too much at stake not to lie. So I'm mostly just forecasting by how much he will lie.  Once the 1st quarter figures come in, and some outside analyses are made public, we should get an idea of how much he is lying.
