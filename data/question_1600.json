Death count fell approximately 75% to 3,200 from the peak by the week of 4/28/2020 as the quarantines began to reduce the preconditions for transmission. Though 35 states have decided to partially pare back those restrictions, the states with highest density, and hence most at risk, have not pared back those restrictions. So, that should contribute to a lower growth rate of infections which curb hospitalizations and deaths attributable to COVID-19.  The effect may be partially mitigated by new diagnoses from the increased availability of testing that makes more excess deaths officially attributable to COVID-19.  While a second upsurge is possible due to the easing of restrictions in some states, the lack of widespread travel, relatively lower population density of those states, and the incubation period of between 7-10 days makes it highly unlikely that a formidable enough upsurge in death counts officially attributable to COVID-19 causes the official CDC death count to exceed 80,000 by May 9."], [27661, "2020-05-04T08:08:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.89, 0.11, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41688, "2020-05-04T05:50:57Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.77, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87448, "2020-05-04T05:06:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87448, "2020-05-04T05:05:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88093, "2020-05-04T04:20:51Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.85, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [87756, "2020-05-04T03:33:17Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [93, "2020-05-04T02:57:30Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87094, "2020-05-04T02:25:40Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.85, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Looking at weekly movement in deaths based on the latest numbers, it looks between 12 to 14k per week for the last few weeks.

Adjusts for day of week variation - there's clear day-of-week variation where counts on Sat/Sun/Mon/Tue are lower than expected if following a perfect linear slope, and counts on Wed/Thu/Fri are higher than expected. See graph on model spreadsheet.\n3. Calculates a standard deviation around the projected mean by taking the projected count minus today's count and dividing by 6 May 9th Forecast: 68,244 The biggest risk here is that the COVID Tracking Project will adjust their counting methodology to include probable deaths per new CDC guidelines, which could cause a big spike in counts.
