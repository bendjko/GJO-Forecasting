Alarmed at the possibility of resumption of hostilities, the African Union decided to deploy a fact-finding mission to both Djibouti and Eritrea.\nDjibouti has cooperated and facilitated the work of the African Union mission in its endeavor to accomplish its mandate. Eritrea, characteristically, has yet to cooperate with the African Union fact-finding mission.  Djibouti, as called for in the resolution just adopted, fully commits to continue cooperating with the Chairperson of the African Union.\"  Lowering forecast, granted this is only one side of the argument, but it seems the work to solve this dispute peacefully is being drawn out.

However, at this early stage of the country's operations in Djibouti it would be unlikely to see a significant change to the slow pace of China's military influence on the African continent. A commitment of 450 troops [2], the presumed equivalent of what Qatar had on the border, would itself not be a challenge to China's vast army, but in this situation it would represent a considerable stretch. It was just late September that Chinese troops stationed in Djibouti had their first live-fire exercise[3] and their airfield lacks the length required for fixed-wing aircraft that would perform air-support of troops on the ground.[4] China will likely use this naval base in Djibouti for it's intended use [5] before using the base as support for ground operations and pivoting toward more tricky displays of commitment to the African region.  It's also worth noting also that China must be invited to step in here, a move that Eritrea is so far against. [6] We should see African Union observers long before the Chinese government is asked to mediate the conflict and it would take a significant change in the situation before China becomes the best choice for peacekeeping on the border.

So I think that the time frame of six months to an announcement is too short.  It took just over a month for China to even announce that it would intervene if asked.

It seem almost impossible that China deploys a UN sanctioned peace keeping mission by the end of the year. To do so, the UN Security Council would have to authorize such a deployment. A UNSC resolution doing so seems only likely if both parties and most probably the African Union agreed beforehand. If either country would agree to China sending peacekeepers remains unclear (https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/dangerous-gulf-horn-how-inter-arab-crisis-fuelling-regional-tensions).  Currently, neither the UNSC nor the AU Peace and Security Council seem to have scheduled deliberations about the situation in the Djibouti-Eritrea border region for this month, suggesting that the current situation is not perceived as urgent by the two bodies. Before authorizing a peace keeping mission, it also seems likely that IOs would use all other means at their hands to deescalate the situation. This would take time. And even if the situation deteriorated rapidly, given the decision-making procedures at least in the UNSC (I don't know much about the AU), a deployment of a peacekeeping mission by the end of the year seems highly unlikely.  In another scenario, China could deploy troops unilaterally (or at the request of Djibouti, perhaps), for example in response to an emerging crisis that directly threatens Chinese interest in Djibouti or in the context of a search-and-rescue operation. This seems unlikely - also because Chinese troops are still in the process of adapting to the conditions under which they have to operate in Djibouti (http://supchina.com/2017/09/25/live-fire-drill-djibouti-chinas-latest-political-current-affairs-news/) - but cannot be fully ruled out.

Despite China\u2019s non-interference policy, in the last year they have offered to mediate relations between Saudi Arabia-Iran, India-Pakistan and Myanmar-Bangladesh. They previously mediated for South Sudan in 2013, \u201cwhen the Horn of Africa nations asked China to help with mediation.\u201d (http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2113416/intervene-or-not-chinas-foreign-policy-experiment-south) \n\u201cChina\u2019s position in the South Sudanese civil war revolved around strict adherence to its non-interference principle, urging parties in the conflict to seek political solutions, direct mediation and deployment of combat troops under the auspices of the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan\u201d (https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&ved=0ahUKEwjA_Oq0htLWAhXCKsAKHTwcDa8QFghEMAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defense.gouv.fr%2Fcontent%2Fdownload%2F498731%2F8484271%2Ffile%2FOBS_Chine_201701-NA14-Chine%2520Sud%2520Soudan.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0v_n9idUgPgGVgd5nIpeYf)  China\u2019s \u201cnational interests\u201d are at risk if the Djibouti-Eritrea dispute escalates. The \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 maritime route goes through the Gulf of Aden and up the Red Sea (hence the recently constructed naval base in Djibouti). However, the Chinese Ambassador to Eritrea, Shu Zhan, told SCMP \u201cChina\u2019s intention to mediate in the border issue has not connection with the Djibouti Port and signals no change in China\u2019s longstanding non-interference policy.\u201d (http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2103947/china-offers-mediate-djibouti-eritrea-border-row-it)\nThat being said, China had invested heavily in South Sudan\u2019s oil infrastructure and both sides of the warring parties knew that without Chinese investment, there would be limited financial income.  I looked at the likelihood of another country taking the position Qatar once held, or the possibility of Qatar returning to the area:\nIn \u201cNovember 2008, Iran had offered to mediate the conflict between Eritrea and Djibouti, citing it\u2019s closeness to both countries\u2026After dubious backdoor deals Djibouti severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 2016.\u201d \n\u201cEritrea has sought to extend its diplomacy by forging new alliances. It raised its cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\u201d\n(https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/ear8.pdf) \n\u201cDjibouti has allowed the establishment of a military base by Saudi Arabia on its territory. Eritrea has allowed the UAE and Saudi Arabia to use the Assab Port\u201d \nHowever, \u201cEthiopia is concerned by Eritrea\u2019s alliance with Saudi Arabia\u201d (https://issafrica.org/iss-today/saudi-arabia-qatar-rift-rattles-the-region) \nAs other forecasters have said, Eritrea wants Qatar to be the only mediator in the matter for internal reasons. The likelihood of Qatar going back to being mediator is low until the GCC dispute is resolved. It was portrayed that both Eritrea and Djibouti sided with Saudi Arabia in the dispute which is likely what prompted Qatar to leave the peacekeeping position. Looks more likely that China would get the position.  Also taking into account the Chinese 19th Party Congress, set for October 18th 2017. This scmp.com article (http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2109388/reading-between-lines-what-watch-chinas-most-important) highlights the things to watch out for, which include: \u201cXi will set out the party\u2019s priorities and general policy directions for his second term. A wide range of areas will be covered \u2013 from the economy, political system, culture, people\u2019s livelihood, ecology, defense and foreign policy to the party\u2019s own development.\u201d Plus, \u201cthe Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high command of the PLA, is also due for a shake-up at the congress.\u201d \nAny announcements of troop deployment could fall under the time period around the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) in March, rather than the 19th Congress. It\u2019s also possible that the upcoming Party congress will postpone any decision relating to Djibouti-Eritrea to post-NPC.  However, I agree with @aaseawaf15 that if the Chinese were to send troops, it would likely be under the UN as blue helmets (as they did in South Sudan). Shu Zhan also said \u201cThe disputes over Dumeira Mountain have been recurring and China have been mediating in it for a long time, mostly through the mechanism of the African Union. I don\u2019t see much of a difference this time.\u201d( http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2103947/china-offers-mediate-djibouti-eritrea-border-row-it)  I will be looking out for any escalation in the border dispute, along with Xi\u2019s policy directions, and any announcements from the AU or UN.

I will update based on those results.  In the meantime, I mostly aggregated some of the other forecasts and added some thoughts of my own.  I think it is pretty unlikely that China would intervene unilaterally - reversing a long-standing non-interventionist policy, particularly when doing so would mean unilateral action in one of the most geostrategically critical areas in the world. Intervening militarily would risk increasing global sensitivity to Chinese expansion and incense other actors in the region. Specifically, this could put an early damper on China's One Belt-One Road efforts and increase regional outcry over its expansion efforts in the South China Sea.  The greater likelihood, I think, is the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force. Even this, however, I think is quite unlikely, as the UN has been hesitant to deploy a force in this conflict in it's ~20 year history.  I will likely update upon further research and consideration.

That makes a 12.5% chance overall. I add to that a 5% chance that violence will break out on the border and the decision will be expedited. Rounding off, that makes 18%.

Part of his foreign policy, is his New Era of China-Africa Win-Win Cooperation and Common Development, which he announced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) December 4, 2015. His Foreign Minister reiterated it three months later. Analyst added it was a military expansion as well. Sea ports and naval bases are just an element of that expansion and influence. We have seen Beijing use its commercial know-how and financial muscle to secure ownership over the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar, Pakistan, a strategic trading base, only to enlist it later into military service. This is China's template. The Djibouti naval base was next, which secures China's presence at the Bab al-Mandab Strait. So, why would China deploy troops to Djibouti-Eritrea? Once Qatar withdrew it troops, Djibouti quickly requested support from the African Union (AU) and Kuang Weilin, the Chinese Ambassador to the African Union, suggested that China will consider sending troops to the border. Eritrea had earlier said they would work only with Qatar. This was prior to China offering to mediate. The African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat has announced that he is sending a delegation to the Djibouti border to monitor developments (no troops). The other option was UN troops. Eritrea said it sees \u2018no real value\u2019 in allowing a visit by a UN monitoring group. So, since both Djibouti and Eritrea are reported as wanting outside mediation, after the AU's investigation, they could easily be the agent to recommend China as the mediator who could then deploy their troops. The only country needed to be somewhat swayed is Eritrea. China is Eritrea's largest investor and creditor and trading partner.  What would change my thinking would be tension over the border to die down or for the two countries to somehow resolve it themselves. The later seems unlikely.

China has presented the facility as a support base to run anti-piracy operations in waters along Africa\u2019s east coast as well as peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the region. China's state news agency Xinhua  did not disclose how many military personnel would be stationed at the facility or when it would become fully operational. But previous mainland reports have put the size of the deployment at 10,000. The lease runs for a decade with China paying US$20 million a year. But given it sits at the shipping choke point of the Gulf of Aden which opens to the Suez Canal and beyond, China\u2019s regional neighbors including Japan, India and Vietnam were likely to view the deployment with alarm, mainland experts said. Djibouti already hosts several foreign military bases, including one each from the US and Japan, two strategic rivals to Beijing. A base by Saudi Arabia is also under construction in Djibouti. My thinking is based on the report that at least 10,000 Chinese troops will be sent to support the new naval base compared to the 4,000 U. S. troops at its base. Sending in even more Chinese troops would fit into President Xi Jinping's expansion desires plus give China better control of the Bab al-Mandab Strait. From China's perspective, It makes sense to have more troops there. At this point, China needs to influence the two countries in conflict and the African Union, who has sent in an investigative body and the UN. The only body that needs to be courted somewhat is Eritrea, which seems very doable."], [12879, "2017-09-14T18:38:33Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2017-09-14T14:02:17Z", [0.14], ""], [361, "2017-09-14T12:51:43Z", [0.01], "But direct military intervention is still not an option, Shu said. \u201cIf China would send a peacekeeping force there, everything would strictly follow three principles \u2013 authorised by the United Nations, requested by the African Union, and agreed by both parties."], [28414, "2017-09-14T08:11:50Z", [0.0], ""], [35033, "2017-09-14T05:12:03Z", [0.6], ""], [36907, "2017-09-14T04:36:53Z", [0.18], ""], [15548, "2017-09-14T03:31:42Z", [0.0], ""], [21884, "2017-09-14T02:11:25Z", [0.01], ""], [35, "2017-09-13T22:33:08Z", [0.03], ""], [38980, "2017-09-13T22:13:43Z", [0.0], ""], [31450, "2017-09-13T21:36:51Z", [0.0], "Deploying peacekeepers on its own would be a major change in Chinese foreign policy and the security council hasn't shown any signs of authorizing a peacekeeping force on the Eritrea-Djubouti border or of extending the mandate of the force along the Eritrea-Ethiopia border.

Things can easily become unmanageable, which leaves the intervening power the choice of taking sides, withdrawing, or doing nothing. None of these courses of action is risk-free, and the best way to not be placed in such a position is to just stay out of the conflict.
