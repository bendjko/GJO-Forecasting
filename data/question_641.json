Last Monday, the navy recovered eight bodies after the collision with the Tunisian navy boat 54 km (33 miles) off the southern coast, while 38 were rescued. According to testimony from survivors, there were between 70 and 80 people on board, the International Organization for Migration has said. The incident has caused anger in Tunisia. The families of some migrants who drowned protested in two towns. In the southern town of Kebili, protesters burned a local government center this week. The number of illegal migrants trying to reach Italy by boat has shot up in recent weeks as unemployed youth seek to escape poverty.
