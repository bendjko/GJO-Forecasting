He has interest in providing free access to public educational institutions by imposing higher tax rates upon those in high income brackets.\nHillary Clinton's campaign has primarily aimed to provide a more centrist, fiscally conservative approach to education reform. As an example, she has stated that she has interest in decreasing interest rates on student loans to reduce financial burden on college graduates.\nThe Pivot Point: \nIn Fall 2013, Iowa had roughly 330,000 students attending higher education institutions. The population of Iowa is roughly 3,200,000. Therefore, we can estimate that college students, the primary demographic of Bernie Sanders' campaign, represent only about 10% of Iowa's population.  On Healthcare:\nBernie Sanders' campaign has drawn both support and criticism for its endorsement of a single-payer system (see: Canada), and an aggressive stance in favor of increased regulation of the Pharmaceutical industry.\nHillary Clinton's campaign has focused on support of the continued growth of the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), with few alterations to the legislation anticipated.\nThe Pivot Point: Between 2010 and 2011, Iowa was the fourth state out of the top ten states to witness the highest drop in insurance competition. This is according to a 2013 report by the American Medical Association. Such a shift, possibly attributed to effects of the Affordable Care Act, may lead to increased support for Sanders' anti-industry approach to Healthcare Reform. On the other hand, one of Iowa's newly developing industries is the Biotechnology sector. Supporters of the newly developed industry may find Clinton's stance more favorable. On General Economy:\nPivot Point: The state of Iowa currently has nine income brackets, with taxes ranging from 0.36 - 8.98%. The state's median household income is around $48,000. Income Per Capita was $23,340 in 2006. The unemployment rate was 3.4% in December of 2015. This information suggests that Iowa's voters may not be as persuaded by Sanders' calls for economic reform, as they appear less directly impacted by recent economic downturn. On Industry/Campaign Finance:\nSanders' campaign has relied upon an influx of small donations, often $5- $100 in amount. This represents a shift from corporate influence on campaign finance, which has drawn support from individuals across party lines.\nClinton's campaign has received over $300,000,000 over the extent of her political career between 1999-2016. A majority of these donations are from individuals associated with major corporations. For example, Clinton's top donors between 1999-2016 are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, DLA Piper, JP Morgan & Chase, and Morgan Stanley.\nThe Pivot Point:\nManufacturing represents 21% of the economy of Iowa. Insurance, Finance, and Banking also represent a large portion of the state's industry. Clinton's connections via campaign financing to these sectors and corporations may enable her to gain the upper-hand on this issue. Overall: \nWhile Bernie Sanders' message may resonate across the college campuses of American universities, it may not be the most ideal to resonate in the minds of the voters of Iowa. His campaign may be negatively impacted by its combative calls for regulation and taxation of the very industries that support the Iowan economy, and maintain the state's low unemployment rate. Meanwhile, recent shifts in Iowa's insurance market may endanger Clinton's campaign as the association is made between the effects of the Affordable Care Act and the growing monopolization of the insurance marketplace within the state."], [18141, "2016-01-31T22:14:47Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], "While Hillary Clinton may be the undisputed party leader (and recipient of some lavish funding), she is also embroiled in what could turn out to be a serious scandal with the Emails.

MORAL OF THE STORY: \nIf you don't think O'Malley is at least at 15%, it's quite literally impossible for him to win at all. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses\nhttp://theweek.com/articles/601463/iowa-caucus-system-completely-absurd--thats-great-news-hillary-clinton-ted-cruz\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/01/23/heres-how-the-iowa-caucuses-work/"], [17064, "2016-01-28T06:06:31Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [17806, "2016-01-28T06:01:14Z", [0.45, 0.12, 0.43], "I believe Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton will be neck and neck for the Iowa caucuses.

This, on paper would benefit BS in that he is selling the \u2018dream\u2019 and a change away from the establishment, pushing for income equality and some very optimistic reforms (free university fees, $15 minimum wages, and single payer healthcare). In regards to the latter, I think it would resonate well with the US population, given the huge costs currently. However \u2013 after 25 years in congress he has failed to get even 1 vote to support these ideas, and therefore feel as though it\u2019s not a realistic outcome.  Although he is running for the Democrats, he started his campaign as an individual and therefore may not have as much support from Democratic voters as HC may be able to command. Despite \u2018traditionally\u2019 being a party that supports modern social liberalism \u2013 throughout the 20th century it has become very pro-business, making it more central in its approach. This is contrary to what BS is standing for \u2013 lowering the influence of businesses through flattening organisational structures and intervening (completely opposite to how America\u2019s market based economy is run). It is for this reason, alongside an assault on corporate tax\u2019s that he has not gained funding from large institutions (as HC has been able to do), and instead had to rely on individuals and smaller donors \u2013 a source that could potentially dry up as they run out of resources. This is different to how HC has run \u2013 with huge support from influential businesses / people / groups and unfortunate as it is \u2013 this is what has historically helped other win elections.  Despite being ahead going into the IOWA and NJ polls, he got wiped out in South Carolina which has a demographic more representative of the population with many minorities. HC has shown huge support for Obama recently (tactical I would assume, as 47% of Americans approve of the job he is doing), and this may help her gain amongst these minorities of whom have the power to sway polls  With the geopolitical environment encountering new issues every single day, HC offers more experience whilst holding certain imperialist principles (she was a key member of the panel that helped certify the Bin Laden raid) and this will take many hearts at the moment of whom are worried about their national security. She has also shown to be a fantastic debater \u2013 often attacking sanders in a show of power.  The IOWA and NJ polls on the 1st and 6th Feb will determine the outcome of this election, and with the \u2018Des Moines Register\u2019 \u2013 a key IOWA newspaper recently endorsing HC over BS saying \u2018\u2019The presidency is not an entry level position \u2013 whomever is sworn into office next January must demonstrate a deep understanding of the issues facing America and also possess the diplomatic skills that enable presidents to get things done\u2019. On the other hand, BS is doing well among people who say they would be caucusing for the first time. The challenge for BS will be teaching newcomers the mechanics of the caucuses which requires a campaign to invest in training / outreach ect\u2026 and at present, BS has $27.3m has in hand \u2013 compared to HC\u2019s $33m.  The 2 options are therefore BS who is offering a \u2018dream\u2019 to regular American, and a move away from the current political climate, or HC who is pushing to build upon Obama\u2019s time in office. With the economy currently nearing full employment, with surging home sales, and increasing savings rates -  I don\u2019t see there being a huge amount of reason to make drastic changes.  That said \u2013 I will be monitoring the political and economical landscape and altering my forecast accordingly! \n"], [691, "2016-01-25T13:20:47Z", [0.64, 0.0, 0.36], ""], [16776, "2016-01-25T13:13:44Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [16776, "2016-01-25T13:13:29Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [12078, "2016-01-25T12:47:20Z", [0.56, 0.02, 0.42], ""], [16102, "2016-01-25T12:44:00Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.5], ""], [14841, "2016-01-25T12:40:53Z", [0.86, 0.0, 0.14], "Bernie Sanders support seems to be centered in just three counties, which leads to difficulty in getting delegates in other areas, he \"may\" win the total vote but not the most delegates."], [14915, "2016-01-25T12:39:30Z", [0.53, 0.0, 0.47], ""], [1646, "2016-01-25T12:25:39Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1007, "2016-01-25T12:05:50Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [240, "2016-01-25T12:01:10Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [13772, "2016-01-25T09:21:44Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8], "People have started paying attention to just how much Clinton could not care less about the average person and just wants to go down in the history books as the first women president.
