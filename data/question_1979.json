So we can think that the vaccination rate of U.S is 2.5 M people per day according with 2.  In this case, we can think that the number of people will have received one or more doses of vaccine is approximate 230M until 30 April 2021.  But if we think that the system is not perfect, in my opinion, the number will be between 170M and 180M (probably). 1. https://time.com/collection/coronavirus-vaccines-updates/\n2. https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/01/28/960901166/how-is-the-covid-19-vaccination-campaign-going-in-your-state"], [22689, "2021-04-18T00:06:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-04-18T00:06:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [13086, "2021-04-17T22:08:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.73, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [98208, "2021-04-17T15:51:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.4, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0], "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-trends "], [75824, "2021-04-17T12:25:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.39, 0.61, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88098, "2021-04-17T11:29:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100452, "2021-04-17T10:43:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Misread the question initially.
