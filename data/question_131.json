Other smaller parties must gather 200,000 signatures of support in at least 29 regions across the country, or the signatures of three percent of voters in any given district \u2013 a task that is tricky, costly, and purposefully designed by the authorities to remove undesirable candidates from the race.

[the Central electoral Commission's]  new head, Ella Pamfilova, Russia\u2019s former human rights ombudsman, the CEC has adopted a more transparent approach to supervising the elections, and has replaced other officials that might bring the legitimacy and objectivity of the CEC into question. The Kremlin has a vested interested in making sure that no large scale fraud takes place this time around, given fears that it could trigger mass protests, the likes of which were seen after the last Duma elections in 2011. In fact, the capacity for organising any large scale fraud in Russia has diminished significantly following the dismissal or arrest of elites who previously conspired to fix the result. \"The CEC may have enhanced its transparency but there will be far fewer independent election observers this year as a result of persistent government pressure on election-monitoring NGOs, such as Golos. The government has therefore been able to secure itself against an independent vote count. . . .  \"Putin\u2019s post-Crimea popularity is still very high [82%], and compared to the domestic situation on the eve of the 2011 elections United Russia is in a much stronger position, even despite a largely unpopular cabinet. However there are a few key factors that might pose a problem for the party: the regional candidates are generally weak, the socio-economic situation has declined since 2011, and the government and people still have strong memories of the protests that took place around the last elections. \"The government appears confident this time that it will achieve the desired result \u2013 another United Russia win - but it prefers to ruffle as few feathers as possible by keeping election turnout low and avoiding any public scandals that could lead to an uprising. \" . . . In October 2015 the State Duma approved the redistricting of constituencies to reflect shifts in population from region to region [and] to harness control over the vote by diluting the more critically-minded urban constituencies with the better disciplined rural electorate. The government has sought to do this by using the so-called \u201cpetal arrangement\u201d, which means that the regions are cut into districts like pieces of cake, and portions of the urban centre are merged with huge rural sectors stretching all the way to the region\u2019s border - sometimes for two or three hundred kilometres. \" . . . . This radical redistricting operation will result in large parts of the population \u2013 mainly urban dwellers - being under-represented by the Duma given that 20 percent of voters, usually the most liberal and critical, reside in urban centres. \"The United Russia party has candidates in all but 18 of the 225 electoral districts, and is set to win the majority of the vote across the country.  \"It is unlikely that there will be any qualitative shifts in the composition of the Duma.  . . .\n\". . .  Putin\u2019s United Russia party will probably grow, and even has a chance of obtaining a qualified majority of two thirds. The Communist party will most likely receive about the same number of votes as last time while the Just Russia party and LDPR will likely see a decrease in the number of deputies to offset the gains by United Russia. \" . . .  Turnout will be of critical importance to the results and, if it is higher than expected, the vote may shift a little more in favour of smaller parties. \n. . . \n\"All of these developments in the run up to the Duma elections point towards a carefully calculated yet reactive political modernisation. Putin has sought to create the perfect conditions to improve the transparency of the electoral process, while simultaneously strengthening the chance of a United Russia win. By introducing a modicum of harmless political competition the chances of an uprising can be minimised.\n. . . \n\"The most widespread explanation for the early elections is that bringing the date forward serves the dual purpose of minimising the time in which more critically-minded constituencies of large urban centres can mobilise, and ensuring relatively low turnout across the board \u2013 factors that play in favour of United Russia.\n. . . \n\"However, the Kremlin may have tied its own hands by bringing the elections forward.

Based on the following data, expect that UR will surpass the 2/3 mark in the Duma elections. \n In 2011 four parties qualified for proportional representation; and United Russia collected 49% of the total vote compared to the 93% of the vote collected by the 4 qualifiers, resulting in UR collecting 53% (238) of the 450 seats. By comparison in 2016 the election has been split. 250 seats to be allocated by proportional representation, and 250 seats to be earned by first-past-the-post district votes.  Again it appears that 4 parties may qualify for proportional representation, although JR is in danger of falling short (this eventuality would result in additional seats for UR).  UR currently has 45% in the polls compared with a total of 72% for the four parties that may qualify for proportional representation. The result may be that UR collects142 (63%) of the proportional seats, a significant increase on the 2011 results.  -- The increase is related to the number of qualifying parties - approx. 7 in 2011 and approx. 14 in 2016, resulting in a dilution of the 2016 vote, giving UR a larger percent of the final seat allocation. To meet the 2/3 GJO requirement, UR would need approx. 71% of the FPTP seats. Given that UR is polling at 45% compared to the next best 10% for CPRF and LDPR, UR should have high probability of meeting this objective. One possible obstacle to UR would be the concentration of the competing parties in specific areas, resulting in seats won at a disproportional level. However, The 2016 wiki, indicates that parties, in order to be eligible for the elections, must submit qualifying signatures from multiple regions around Russia, thereby forcing parties to have a national presence to qualify (more on this below). It seems that this requirement would effectively prevent minority parties from dominating specific high concentration areas:\n\"The Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation determined the 14 political parties that can submit lists of candidates without collecting signatures.[9] Whilst other parties are required to present at least 200,000 signatures (with a maximum of 7,000 signatures per region)\". -- The result is that a party, if not approved by the election committee, must get signatures in 29 regions (200,000 / 7,000).

And, sorry, I cannot provide references for my comments as I rely on sources in Russian.\nSeveral points:\n1. It looks at least some people are making predictions based on past performance of UR in the last elections and current poll results. But electoral system has changed and you can do that only for half the seats, which are chosen through the past proportional system. It is a new ballgame for the other half, which is based on the majority, or \"first-past-the-post\" system, in which UR will most probably get disproportionately more seats.\n2. I suggest - Don't rely on polls that much. In Russia in polls people tend to give higher support to the ruling party then it is - heritage from the communist past. E.g. polls consistently often underestimate support for (some irony here) the Communist party. Besides, it looks that now we see significantly lower portion of people (70%+) who say they will vote for 4 parties that have real chances to get into Duma and are already in the parliament. Before previous elections it was around 90%. But no other parties (besides these 4) are predicted to overcome 5% threshold.  So, probably numbers for these 4 parties will change when voters face the reality of their lost votes.\n4. Projections for \"first-past-the-post\" system are also complicated: it is already manipulated. UR did not field candidates in 18 out of 225 seats, clearly giving them out to other 3 parties to take. Why? Because other 3 parties in parliament are not opposition: on major issues they vote with the ruling party and the government wants them to continue to do so.\nAnd all of it is with the background that this time the government tries to make the vote look more trustworthy. Hence, they may not even want to get over 2/3 in Duma. No need actually, others will give the government the parliamentary support they want.\nStill, it looks there is a big chance UR may get more than 2/3 of the seats. I am increasing their chances to do that..."], [368, "2016-08-12T19:11:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [4577, "2016-08-12T18:15:26Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.65], ""], [691, "2016-08-12T17:57:48Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [28203, "2016-08-12T14:36:53Z", [0.26, 0.15, 0.59], ""], [476, "2016-08-12T12:10:55Z", [0.0, 0.29, 0.71], "Monitoring of Duma vote becoming more of an issue.

As evidence, critics cite the Communist Party\u2019s enthusiastic support for Putin\u2019s foreign policy, as well as for legislation aimed at clamping down on civil liberties. \u201cThe Communists have long accepted the rules of the game,\u201d says prominent Russian political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin. \u201cThey...are allowed to criticize the authorities because the Kremlin knows this is not going to lead to radical change. Putin holds the key\u2014and the key is money.\u201dFormer members of the Communist Party are even harsher. \u201cThe Communist Party is an empty shell, a simulacrum,\u201d says Anatoly Baranov, who was expelled from the party in 2007 as part of a large-scale purge of dissenters. \u201cIts political program is a fake and one that no one intends to implement.\u201dCommunist Party officials angrily refute such claims. \u201cIn all elections, both national and regional, we raise the red flag and move forward for victory,\u201d says Rashkin. \u201cWe are also the most active opposition party when it comes to street protests. \u201d. . .  Despite well-documented evidence that he sent millions to their deaths in the gulags, Stalin\u2019s popularity has rocketed amid Russia\u2019s confrontation with the West over Ukraine and Syria. For the first time this year, a majority of Russians (52 percent) indicated in an annual opinion poll that they considered Stalin\u2019s bloody rule \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d a positive thing. \u201cIn Russia, we say no one judges the winner,\u201d says Obukhovsky, the young Komsomol leader. \u201cAnd Stalin won. He defeated time, he defeated his own death, and he defeated his enemies. And that\u2019s why we, the younger generation, are proud to carry banners bearing his name. \u201dWith the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution looming, Russia\u2019s Communists are confident that history is on their side. \u201cSooner or later, by whatever means,\u201d insists Obukhovsky, \u201cthe Communist Party will come to power again.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It sounds to me like the Communist Party has momentum, but will that be enough to deny United Russia a significant # of seats  in a low-turnout election?\n"], [12879, "2016-08-10T19:23:40Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.84], ""], [368, "2016-08-10T17:35:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [484, "2016-08-10T16:30:42Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], "(no change for now) Since it was based on Levada polling I want to consider the implications in this article: http://www.newsweek.com/more-russians-grow-indifferent-putin-economy-bites-488337 Wonder if \"the devil you know\" will be sufficient (probably) or if a lack of \"succession plan\" might actually weaken either the results or (more likely) the turn out?"], [691, "2016-08-10T15:25:44Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [498, "2016-08-10T15:06:27Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.91], "Russian opposition leader is attacked on the campaign trail\nhttp://www.dailystar.com.lb//News/World/2016/Aug-10/366568-russian-opposition-leader-is-attacked-on-the-campaign-trail.ashx"], [1708, "2016-08-10T13:42:09Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82], ""], [4577, "2016-08-10T11:07:37Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [23006, "2016-08-10T01:07:11Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [691, "2016-08-09T20:00:59Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [368, "2016-08-09T17:09:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2016-08-09T14:26:06Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [1712, "2016-08-09T13:51:09Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-08-08T18:54:30Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.87], ""], [368, "2016-08-08T17:51:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [556, "2016-08-08T16:43:05Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [10898, "2016-08-08T07:24:22Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "Ok, so recent polls by FOM and Levada have UR at 47/72=65% and 39/59=66% of the vote.

According to the most recent Levada poll, only three other parties stand a solid chance of getting into parliament: The Communists, still led by Gennady Zyuganov, who almost beat Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential election; the misnamed Liberal Democratic Party of the populist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and Fair Russia, an amorphous center-left force set up artificially by the Kremlin to balance \"center-right\" United Russia. Three relatively liberal parties are running, but none has more than 1 percent support. The one with the best chances -- experts predict it may get up to 3 percent -- is Yabloko, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, another 1996 presidential candidate. Other tired \"faces\" of Russia's battered liberalism, Vladimir Ryzhkov and Irina Khakamada, are running, too. \"Absent from the list of candidates is Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption activist who has probably done the most to revive Russian politics and who won more than a quarter of the vote in 2013 in a Moscow mayoral election, conceding defeat only to United Russia heavyweight Sergei Sobyanin. Navalny has been convicted twice on trumped-up charges to disqualify him from running. \" According to the Levada Center, 42 percent of Russians believe the election will be a mere imitation of political struggle. The turnout will probably be extremely low; if answers by those who do not plan to vote are taken into account, United Russia's 55 percent shrinks to 35 percent. \"Putin has created a political climate and a system that make it unnecessary to rig the election. The news media are tightly controlled. The few relatively independent outlets are regularly shown that they have to toe the line. In a speech to a recent United Russia convention, Putin explained how he sees campaigning in today's Russia, surrounded by enemies and saddled with Western sanctions:\n. . . \n\"Putin may be impressed by Donald Trump, but, judging by this tirade, he wouldn't have been allowed to run for the State Duma. No one particularly colorful is.. . . \"The lists are full of party functionaries, public servants and pro-government activists -- people who clearly won't be independent,\" Krasheninnikov wrote. \"With all the formal and informal restrictions that exist today, the prospect of having to declare all their property, getting out of business and coming under sanctions of some sort has become an important reason for many to dodge political careers.\" In other words, Putin has steamrolled the political landscape so thoroughly that only an ossified, bored, boring \"political elite\" from the 1990s and his own grey-faced loyalists of a more recent vintage can get elected.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://globalvoices.org/2016/07/09/with-2-months-before-parliamentary-elections-russias-internet-censor-swings-into-action/ \" . . . some experts today are speculating that the Communist Party\u2014which enjoys enduring popularity among older voters and, some say, is increasingly appealing to younger people\u2014might consider mounting a genuinely oppositional campaign this contest, . . . \n. . . \n \"Roskomnadzor . . . . blocked the [4] websites because of \u201ccalls to action,\u201d and not exclusively for promoting an election boycott.  . . . .The Russian media later learned that one of the four blocked websites belonged to Mikhail Khodorkovsky\u2019s oppositionist movement Open Russia, which was soon unblocked after it removed the content identified by law enforcement.

Statistical analysis suggested that United Russia, the pro-Putin party, owed its majority to widespread ballot-stuffing.  . . . the authorities took care to make voting more transparent for the 2012 presidential election, organizing a live video feed from every polling station and making sure not to obstruct observers' work.  . . .  \"In September . . . if there's any vote-rigging, it will be much harder to notice than in 2011. Putin doesn't want to be accused of cheating. He wants a clear, convincing victory and a parliament filled with loyalists or representatives of tried and tested parties that have long traded any principles for the benefits of official recognition, public funding and a chance to make money from industry lobbyists. And that is exactly what Putin will get, despite some rather cynical attempts to make the race look real. \"Earlier this year, United Russia held what it called \"primaries\" to determine the list of people who would run in the actual election. The party said 10.5 million people took part, even though the results of the mock election weren't binding and the party hierarchy -- meaning the Kremlin -- determined the final list of candidates. Russia even has its own prediction market, set up by a pro-Kremlin polling service; United Russia is the favorite, of course. \"Recent polls by the independent Levada Center put the party in the lead, too: 55 percent of those who intend to vote are for it. According to the most recent Levada poll, only three other parties stand a solid chance of getting into parliament: The Communists, still led by Gennady Zyuganov, who almost beat Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential election; the misnamed Liberal Democratic Party of the populist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and Fair Russia, an amorphous center-left force set up artificially by the Kremlin to balance \"center-right\" United Russia. Three relatively liberal parties are running, but none has more than 1 percent support. The one with the best chances -- experts predict it may get up to 3 percent -- is Yabloko, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, another 1996 presidential candidate. Other tired \"faces\" of Russia's battered liberalism, Vladimir Ryzhkov and Irina Khakamada, are running, too.\n. . . \n\" . . .  According to the Levada Center . . .  The turnout will probably be extremely low; if answers by those who do not plan to vote are taken into account, United Russia's 55 percent shrinks to 35 percent. \"Putin has created a political climate and a system that make it unnecessary to rig the election. The news media are tightly controlled. The few relatively independent outlets are regularly shown that they have to toe the line. In a speech to a recent United Russia convention, Putin explained how he sees campaigning in today's Russia, surrounded by enemies and saddled with Western sanctions . . .  \". . .  No one particularly colorful [has been allowed to run for the State Duma]. . . . \n\"The lists are full of party functionaries, public servants and pro-government activists -- people who clearly won't be independent,\"  . . .  In other words, Putin has steamrolled the political landscape so thoroughly that only an ossified, bored, boring \"political elite\" from the 1990s and his own grey-faced loyalists of a more recent vintage can get elected.  . . .  the next State Duma will be as docile as the last one. \" . . . .This is the first election since the 1990s taking place during an economic downturn, and the people who run the country are unspeakably corrupt. But Russians clearly are not tired enough of the same old faces, names and policies to demand change. _ Leonid Bershidsky, a Bloomberg View contributor, is a Berlin-based writer.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.rt.com/politics/347964-center-left-opposition-intends-to/ June 23 2016.  \"The leader of the Fair Russia [aka Just Russia] party told reporters he and his comrades hope to outperform other opposition parties in September\u2019s Duma elections by attracting some incumbent lawmakers currently representing other parliamentary parties to their ranks. \u201cOur party is ready for cooperation with professionals who share our views.

The landowners will be legally bound to use their plots for one of the specified purposes and will not be able to sell them on. The maximum size of the plots is fixed at 1 hectare (about 2.5 acres). The candidates for receiving free plots fall into 30 different categories and most of them can be described as distinguished workers and people who have dedicated themselves to difficult and important professions.

Putin has been able to win wider international acceptance for his claim that the Ukrainian government bears major responsibility for continuing violence in that country\u2019s east and for the stalemated implementation of the Minsk II agreement, and his surprise military intervention in Syria last year 3)  Weak opposition faces obstacles, lacks leadership & issues:\n-tough election laws kept reformist candidates off the ballot in all but one of last fall\u2019s regional races\n-reformist candidates performed poorly where they were on the ballot last fall.\n-Opposition groups united to form a coalition early this year, but their effort fragmented almost immediately.  Supporters of Aleksei Navalny, the anti-corruption activist whom the Kremlin has kept under house arrest, soon left the new organization\n-only a tiny number of voters took part in the reformists coalition\u2019s online primary, which had to be canceled after an apparent hacking.\n-The authorities have been able to restrict the work of election monitors and limit media access for opposition figures; \n-a televised sex tape of the head of the liberal PARNAS party made him the object of public ridicule.\n--the opposition\u2019s critique of Putin\u2019s economic management is hardly different from the critique made by Putin's own best-known advisor. \n-Given the many obstacles under which his opponents labor, Putin need not worry that candidates supporting him will fail to come out on top.\n_\"If liberal candidates have any chance at all, it will be by focusing on a handful of single-mandate districts. (In this election, half of the deputies will be chosen by proportional representation; the other half, in individual races.)\n-\"It is quite possible that the new Duma will include only the same four Kremlin-friendly parties as the old Duma: United Russia, Just Russia (a United Russia-spin-off), the Communists and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky\u2019s \u201cLiberal Democrats.\u201d 4)  The power of the purse:  with the price of oil stabilizing at around $50 per barrel, it's easier to imagine a balanced budget (and stimulative counter-cyclical government spending)  5)  Putin controls the debate & possibly the outcome.  To get the election outcome they want, Putin and his circle appear willing to sacrifice legitimacy.  A final innovation in Kremlin strategy is perhaps the most revealing measure of continuing anxiety about the coming round of elections: the recent creation of the new National Guard. This law enforcement unit, directly controlled by the president, has an ominous and much-publicized legal mandate to shoot demonstrators. Reasons why United Russia may not do well:\n1)  Continued economic hard-times/the sluggish performance of the economy:  a promised 2016 turnaround has not materialized.  Russia may be about to enter the third year of recession.  2) The shaky popularity of United Russia and lack of success in efforts to improve it\n-down to 35 percent in a recent Levada poll\n- The Kremlin has introduced a number of innovations designed to bolster public enthusiasm for the ruling party and to legitimize the election results. U.S.-style \u201cprimaries\u201d have been held to select United Russia\u2019s Duma candidates, and in March the president appointed Ella Pamfilova, the human rights ombudsman and former activist, to head the CEC.  Yet these measures have had uncertain results at best. Turnout in the primaries has been less than half the stated goal, and Pamfilova, aware of suspicion that she will not defy the Kremlin, voided elections in a Moscow suburb, citing multiple violations of the law by local officials. (\u201cLet them fear Pamfilova,\u201d she has warned.)\n-Members of the ruling-party leadership have begun to acknowledge that United Russia may fall further short of a majority of the party-list vote this September than it did in 2011. 3)  General disapproval/unhappiness with those in power.  The critics' deep criticism is of abuse of power throughout the system. The near-enslavement of workers by a fish-processing plant in Russia\u2019s Far East and the defrauding of middle-class investors in a Moscow real estate scheme were just two of many outrages cited during the program, all of them made possible by the indifference or collusion of state officials.  To address these horror stories, Putin had prepared himself with a new electoral theme: the primacy of domestic concerns over foreign policy. In more than three-and-a-half hours of televised Q&A on Russia\u2019s problems both at home and abroad, it was Putin who consistently deflated nationalist rhetoric, insisting that addressing the everyday hardship and injustice endured by ordinary citizens must be a priority. 4)  Scapegoating:  given a chance to say how they really feel about their circumstances\u2014and Putin's absence from the ballot gives them that chance\u2014Russians may choose unpredictably.  As Valery Fedorov, the head of VTsIOM (the state-funded All-Russia Center for Public Opinion Research) put it recently, \u201cNo Russian election is complete without a surprise.\u201d"], [691, "2016-06-19T15:06:50Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.81], ""], [368, "2016-06-18T19:00:01Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-18T12:39:29Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.81], ""], [368, "2016-06-17T17:41:24Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-17T12:13:08Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.81], ""], [556, "2016-06-16T23:54:44Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], "Based on:   http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/260824"], [556, "2016-06-16T21:01:52Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.88], ""], [21758, "2016-06-16T20:27:51Z", [0.06, 0.1, 0.84], ""], [1262, "2016-06-16T20:07:51Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.57], "See discussion here:  http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/260824"], [368, "2016-06-16T18:39:04Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [1262, "2016-06-16T16:22:20Z", [0.48, 0.01, 0.51], "Modifying forecast based on information from link (1, see extract) below.    The issue is related to the wording of the question:  There is no doubt Putin's party will remain in control but the seats won by \"United Russia\" may not include seats won by \"All-Russia People's Front\" which is affiliated (2) with \"United Russia\" but is separate. \"What's more, some pro-government candidates will disguise themselves as independents. \"In the last few years, United Russia candidates shied away from their party labels and tried to hide them during elections,\" says political consultant Mikhail Vinogradov. This tactic proved very effective during the 2014 Moscow City Duma election, in which all of the seats were chosen in single-member constituencies. Almost all of the candidates Moscow authorities were relying on made it through by not affiliating themselves publicly with the ruling party. The opposition was not even there, it failed to provide the necessary number of local signatures to take part. The same scheme will be used in September. Many pro-presidential candidates will represent the All Russia People's Front, a movement established on the eve of Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012. It remains unknown whether they will join United Russia in the newly formed Duma or form a separate faction. Whatever the case, the Kremlin is set to keep control over its majority.\"\n1: http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/united-russia-same-game-new-tactics/572698.html\n2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_Russia"], [691, "2016-06-16T12:20:42Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82], ""], [93, "2016-06-16T00:30:48Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [368, "2016-06-15T21:42:29Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-15T12:18:53Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82], ""], [10898, "2016-06-15T05:55:59Z", [0.1, 0.24, 0.66], ""], [13377, "2016-06-14T22:16:55Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.85], ""], [368, "2016-06-14T18:00:16Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-14T11:20:53Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82], ""], [368, "2016-06-13T21:47:48Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-13T20:07:27Z", [0.0, 0.19, 0.81], ""], [4577, "2016-06-13T10:04:51Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [601, "2016-06-12T20:59:26Z", [0.05, 0.03, 0.92], ""], [368, "2016-06-12T19:00:34Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [691, "2016-06-12T13:25:17Z", [0.0, 0.18, 0.82], ""], [83, "2016-06-11T19:34:18Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.6], ""], [368, "2016-06-11T18:08:33Z", [0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [15548, "2016-06-11T15:20:48Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [691, "2016-06-11T12:36:57Z", [0.0, 0.17, 0.83], ""], [691, "2016-06-10T18:55:13Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.84], "Vlad the Shirtless doesn't need 2/3 for anything particular, but he has helpfully outlawed most or all of the opposition parties and killed or incarcerated most of the opposition leadership.

Still need to figure out all of the implications but one revision is for sure. In shortest possible form: \n*Duma deputies who are not members of the United Russia but that were elected after being nominated by United Russia count as members of United Russia's fraction in Duma.* This is best illustrated by Duma 2011 elections (those used purely proportional system). UR party list included 183 independents that were NOT members of UR. (Out of 596; IOW, the % was practically the same as as today, almost a third). UR list won enough votes for 238 seats. And that is exactly the majority number that UR is said to currently have in Duma!\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_legislative_election,_2011\nhttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F#2011.E2.80.942013 And to confirm, there is at least this one guy who is, to this day, not a member of any party but who was elected in 2011 on a UR list:\nhttp://zauralonline.ru/news-kurgan-obl/society/31555-31555.html\nhttp://ura.ru/articles/1036267018 With that, current polling (only four parties passing 5% threshold: 46%,10%,11%,7%) suggests ~ 175 seats to UR on proportional list (139 + another 36 after proportional redistribution of the remaining seats). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_legislative_election,_2016#Opinion_polls\nSeems pretty high!!! In any case, seems almost impossible that it will get to below 50% overall, so let's say 50%. So, 112 as an absolute minimum. Of course, things can change in three months... I am still thoroughly confused on what happens to independents in single-seat constituencies. UR *will be* nominating a bunch (20-30%?) of non-party members there as well! Should they win, will they too be counted as being part of United Russia in Duma? Seems pretty crazy if yes, but I am now inclined to believe that that's how it will be counted. YMMV. If so, everything I read so far indicates that the expectations are that UR gets great results in majoritarian part of the elections (simply, it's the candidates with most power and influence behind them who will win). So let's say 51%, very conservatively, making no majority pretty unlikely. All in all, I completely turn around, drastically reducing bin <1/2 and even more drastically upping bin >2/3. Apologies to everyone who I misled with my confusion over what counts as \"United Russia\". Fundamentally, there are two ways to count and different ways of counting would answer a different question about Russia's political situation (Putin's control of Duma vs United Russia's waning influence and popularity) but it would make sense if GJI sticks to how Russians in Duma itself count...

To give the figures I have to hand (source: www.europaworld.com, citing the Russian Federal Electoral Commission and websites of regional parliaments), elections were held to 13 regional parliaments in Sept 2015 (there is no reason to regard which regions these were as being particularly representative of the federation as a whole - notably few ethnic republics, in which support for United Russia has tended to be particularly, or in some cases unbelievably, strong - were included - nor is there any reason to be regarded as notably unrepresentative, in as much as the results of similar elections held in other regions in the previous few years are not notably different). In those polls, United Russia scored an average of 58.8% to those seats elected on party lists using proportional representation. As regards single mandate seats (which typically constitute around one-half of the seats in regional parliaments), information about elected candidates is harder to track down. But in those six territories that had elections in for which this information is available, on average *81.7%* of elected deputies (both party lists and single mandate deputies) went on to join the United Russia faction in the respective regional parliaments. (By way of comparison, in these six territories - Kostroma Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, the Republic of Komi, Kurgan Oblast, the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug-Yugra and Novosibirsk Oblast, the average % share for United Russia in the party list vote was 59.0% -ie almost identical to the share across all 13 regions). Only in one territory with Sept 2015 elections, Novosibirsk Oblast, did United Russia score under half of the PR vote, with 44.6%. But even there 65.8% of the deputies joined the United Russia faction - the only place where under two-thirds of deputies did this.  There is one potentially important proviso here: the distinction between United Russia party membership, and United Russia parliamentary faction (or fraction) membership. Formally, many single-mandate candidates (or in some regions, all who contest such seats) are  nominally independent at the date of election, but align themselves formally with United Russia when the parliament concerned convenes. This system of party affiliation also applied, to an extent, in the 1999 and 2003 Duma elections, when many candidates elected as independents were in practice aligned with a party.

In the short term, thugs win elections, of course, so if he backs off United--and especially if he signs on with someone else--things could get pretty strange pretty fast.

Conversely, the party would need to ride Putin's coattails pretty hard to repeat their 2007 performance (70 percent).
