President Donald Trump signed off on this, writing in a letter to the Senate, \u201cthe inclusion of Montenegro in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have the effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the United States in the common budgets of NATO,\u201d so it won\u2019t affect how much the U.S. contributes monetarily to NATO, and it \u201cdoes not detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its military requirements outside the North Atlantic area.\u201d Still, the Balkans is a volatile region, and it\u2019s well-known that Montenegro does not bring substantial material benefit to the transatlantic alliance. The Cipher Brief\u2019s Kaitlin Lavinder spoke with Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who recently visited the Balkans and met with leaders there, about what Montenegro brings to NATO and the current state of affairs in the region. The Cipher Brief: President Trump, in the letter he sent to the Senate on April 11, said that Montenegro\u2019s membership in NATO essentially won\u2019t harm the United States. But how does membership benefit the United States and the transatlantic alliance in general? Senator John McCain: First of all, their geographic location. It\u2019s a small country, but it\u2019s very strategically located. Second of all, its population and people are Western oriented, and there has been, as recently as a few months ago, an attempt by the Russians to overthrow the freely elected government of Montenegro. Being a member of NATO would provide them with some additional security. And their military has contributed to our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we\u2019re always grateful for that.\nand rationale:\nhttps://www.thecipherbrief.com/article/europe/western-balkans-russias-crosshairs-1091?utm_source=Join+the+Community+Subscribers&utm_campaign=9e2f0dbf76-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_05_24&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_02cbee778d-9e2f0dbf76-122492589\n\" NATO prepares to add another small Balkan country to its ranks \u2013 Montenegro is expected to join on June 5 \u2013 the region that has long been torn between the East and the West, and plagued with internal ethnic, socioeconomic, and political tensions is once again showing signs of increased instability. \u201cThe Western Balkans is in the crosshairs of Russian influence operations right now \u2026 Across the whole region, Russia is meddling and trying to subvert some of the governments and sow chaos and instability,\u201d Michael Carpenter, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, told a Senate Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) hearing last week. \u201cI worry that the Balkans may not get sufficient U.S. attention,\u201d said Steven Pifer, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, at the CSCE hearing. In March, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs from Montenegro, Albania, and Croatia landed in Washington to discuss their new trilateral agreement for expanding security cooperation and political dialogue, and to urge the United States to pay more attention. Montenegro\u2019s Foreign Minister Srdjan Darmanovic said at an Atlantic Council event that for the past two years, Russia\u2019s opposition to NATO enlargement \u2013 namely, expanding to include Montenegro \u2013 has become \u201cbigger\u201d and \u201cmore involved.\u201d Foreign Minister Davor Ivo Stier of Croatia echoed that, saying it\u2019s \u201cevident\u201d that in the last years there has been an increased Russian presence in the region. And Foreign Minister Ditmir Bushati of Albania noted an \u201cassertive Russia\u201d in Montenegro. In October 2016, the Russians allegedly orchestrated a coup attempt in Montenegro, plotting to seize the country\u2019s parliamentary building, kill the Prime Minister, and install a new government that would be hostile to NATO. Montenegro recently indicted 14 individuals suspected of being involved in the attempted coup, including two Russians. Why has Russia over the past few years become increasingly aggressive in the Balkans, stoking old tensions and creating new ones? John Cappello, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who previously served as the U.S. Defense Attach\u00e9 to Serbia, told The Cipher Brief the answer is two-fold: Putin has consolidated more power domestically and needs an enemy \u2013 that is, the United States, and the Western world more broadly \u2013 to maintain nationalist sentiment at home; and Putin sees an opening. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of taken our eye off the ball in the Balkans,\u201d he said, noting that integration following the wars of the 1990s remains incomplete.\""], [35425, "2017-05-24T13:42:11Z", [1.0], "The offer has been put out there.

First of all, I signed a declaration together with President Juncker and President Tusk in Warsaw in July and later on together with the High Representative Federica Mogherini we agreed in December on forty-two concrete measures on how to strengthen NATO E.U. cooperation.
