The 2020 report says \"iPhone net sales decreased during 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to the absence of new iPhone models in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the introduction of iPhone SE in the third quarter of 2020.\" The IPhone 12 released in late October, later than usual annual mid-September release. Apple's Q4 ends on the last Saturday of September. Normally the first few days of the new release gets counted in Q4. This year it missed Q4 entirely, so that likely means Q1 of FY 2021 will be larger than normal. That seems to me to be likely to set FY 2021 on track to be larger than FY 2019 (FY 2020 was only 3% down from 2019). I don't know how big the bump from those first few days is but I'd guess since Apple cites it as one reason 2020 was 3% down from 2019 instead of exceeding 2019 that it's maybe 2% of FY 2019 or so. Not large but gives 2021 a slight advantage going in. Since the effect of those numbers ending up in Q1 may be small I also looked at the Iphone sale history. It looks like it's a general upward trend with a recent plateau over the last few years. It seems like most of their decreases come after boom years, otherwise the trend is somewhat steadier. So eyeballing based on that and the delayed Iphone 12 I think an increase is more probably than not.

More models will allow apple to reach more consumers (but possibly hurt margins).\n2) FY 2021 will hopefully see fewer lockdowns than 2020. Also, I expect FY2020 caused a lot of people to defer upgrading or purchasing a new iPhone. This might push people to upgrade in FY2021. \n3) Exchange rates and sales in developing countries will be something to monitor into the future.
