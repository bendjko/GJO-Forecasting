I looked at the historical data from angola for the last 5 months and used that to calculate an average number of events per month, as well as the likelihood that those end up in fatalities. Based on the data, no riots resulted in casualties with an average of 6.2 events per month, in cases of violence against civilians, there is a 22% chance that it results in a casualty, with an average of 3.6 events per month, and a 100% likelihood that a battle will result in civilian casualties with .2 per month. Since there was only one battle reported, this data is skewed, so I will use the data from the entirety of africa to get a better statistic which shows that only 66% result in civilian casualties. Also, the fact that 0% of riots resulted in death seemed similarly skewed, as a 0% chance seems impossible. The data from zimbabwe showed a 4.4% chance, as a comparison for scale. Since it appears that riots in angola are safer I will use a number of 1.5 % to still take this into account to some extent. Using these numbers I estimate that there is a 40.9% likelihood of violence against civilians resulting in a casualty, and a 13 % chance that a battle will, and a 9% chance that riots will. Combining these numbers yields a 52% liklihood that violence will result in a casualty in october.

However, there is almost certainly an overestimation of the base rate, as the rate of occurrence at the beginning of the time series was 83% to 100% over a period of five years. Focusing on the second decade on record (2007-2016), the rate of occurrence is 20% (23 out of 120 months). As there are no apparent seasonal variations except for the third quarter of the year (in the past decade, there were no relevant fatalities in the third quarter in only 3 years as compared to 5 and 7 years in the other three quarters) and the overall rate of occurrence per month is similar in most months except for July, 20% served as a base rate for this estimate. This year, relevant incidents have been recorded in three months, so far. Based on data of the previous decade, this is not an unusual number \u2013 there were three years in the past decade with 4 months in which relevant incidents were recorded, in one year this number was three and in six year the number was between 0 and 2. An additional month in which a relevant incident could be recorded is, therefore, not entirely unlikely. With three remaining months this year and all three months having been similarly affected in the past decade (October: 3 out of 10, November: 2 out of 1o, December: 2 out of 10), only a slight adjustment above the base rate seems to be justified.  Some of the relevant incidents recorded this year seemed to have been related to the elections in August according to the ACLED data-set. The new president was sworn in recently without triggering violence so far. Nevertheless, the resignation of the long-time opposition leader and the subsequent need to hold a party congress to elect his successor adds some uncertainties to the situation.
