8,530 people, 60% of them civilians, have been killed and 48,800 injured in air strikes and fighting on the ground since March 2015, according to the UN.\nThe conflict has also left 20.7 million

Comments by David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme, were unusually forthright for such a U.N. official in criticizing one party in a conflict. Calling for an end to the coalition\u2019s campaign, he accused the Saudi-led coalition of hampering provision of aid. \u201cSaudi Arabia should fund 100 percent (of the needs) of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen,\u201d he said, speaking to Reuters in Ethiopia during a trip to drought-affected areas. \u201cEither stop the war or fund the crisis. Option three is, do both of them.\u201d At least 10,000 people have been killed in the war while widespread hunger and an unprecedented cholera epidemic have led aid agencies to describe Yemen as one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters. A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Beasley\u2019s comments.

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has taken advantage of a civil war pitting the Houthi movement against the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to try to widen its control and influence in Yemen. \"Since early morning on Thursday, Yemeni troops and Hadrami (from Hadramout province) Elite Forces, with U.S. and UAE backing, moved to smash elements of the terrorist organizations, especially AQAP,\" WAM reported. WAM did not say what kind of support the UAE and U.S. militaries had provided or give details on the outcome of the raids. Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, confirmed the operation in a statement issued later Thursday. \"Yemeni government armed forces launched a major operation against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants in the Shabwah Governorate of Yemen. The operation is being closely supported by a combined UAE and U.S. enabling force,\" he said (para. 1-6). Yaakoubi, A., E. (2017). U.S.-backed Yemeni troops attack al Qaeda in southern state.

Oxfam projected the number could rise to more than 600,000 cases, \"the largest ever recorded in any country in a single year since records began\", exceeding Haiti in 2011. Nigel Timmins, the charity's humanitarian director who has just returned from the country, said: \"Cholera has spread unchecked in a country already on its knees after two years of war and which is teetering on the brink of famine. For many people, weakened by war and hunger, cholera is the knockout blow.\" The WHO reported 368,207 suspected cases and 1,828 deaths in the Arabian Peninsula country since late April. \"Every day we have 5,000 more Yemenis falling sick with symptoms of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera,\" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a news briefing in Geneva. \"Yemen's cholera outbreak is far from being controlled, the rainy season has just started and may increase the paths of transmission. Sustained efforts are required to stop the spread of this disease,\" she said. Millions are malnourished in Yemen where famine looms, the United Nations says.

In a speech televised on rebel television, Saleh al-Samad, the leader of a pro-rebel political council in Yemen's fractious war, said envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed was \"not desirable\" for resolving the country's conflict. Samad added that the United Nations should know Cheikh Ahmed is \"is not wanted after today.\" The rebels, known as Houthis, issued a statement supporting Samad's position. Yemen has been engulfed in civil war since September 2014 when the rebels swept into the capital of Sanaa and overthrew the internationally recognized government. A Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition opposes them, but the Iran-backed rebels still control the capital and much of the north. Peace efforts have repeatedly failed. Last Tuesday, Cheikh Ahmed told the U.N. Security Council that serious negotiations on the first steps to a cessation of hostilities in Yemen had been slow and the key parties were reluctant to even discuss the concessions needed for peace. \"I will not hide from this council that we are not close to a comprehensive agreement,\" he said, adding that Houthi officials refused to meet with him (para. 1-7).

Yemen has been torn by two years of civil war, which has killed over 10,000 people, displaced more than three million and ruined the country's infrastructure. The war, which has sucked in a Saudi-led Arab coalition, has shown little sign of ending. The war has been exploited by al Qaeda and the Islamic State group to widen their influence in the impoverished country, prompting repeated U.S. air strikes against militants. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi was in Muscat at Oman's invitation to discuss ways to bridge differences with the Houthis, who control the capital Sanaa with their allies, over plans presented by the U.N. special envoy to Yemen last week. The plans, presented by U.N. Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed during a regional tour last week, included confidence building measures such as turning over the Red Sea port of Hodeidah to a neutral party, opening Sanaa airport for civilian traffic and paying civil servants' salaries. U.N. aid chief Stephen O'Brien warned on Tuesday that any attempt to extend the war to the strategic port city would \"directly and irrevocably drive the Yemeni population further into starvation and famine\". The Omani side has conveyed to Mekhlafi the Houthis' willingness to accept this plan but also its insistence that civil servants' salaries be paid first. \"The differences regarding Hodeidah now center on the identity of the neutral party which will manage the port,\" the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Oman maintains good ties with the Houthis, who seized Sanaa in 2014 in a campaign that eventually forced Hadi to flee to Saudi Arabia in 2015 with his government. The Gulf Arab state had long mediated in international affairs, including facilitating talks between Iran and the United States. Hadi's government, which had recently made some small gains at the battlefront after months after a long stalemate, has threatened to attack Hodeidah, where most of Yemen's food and humanitarian supplies enter, unless the Houthis agreed to turn the facility over to neutral observers (para. 1-10).

The United Nations has warned the Arab alliance fighting Iran-aligned Houthis against any attempt to extend the war to Hodeidah, a vital Red Sea aid delivery point where some 80 percent of Yemen's food imports arrive. \"An attack on Hodeidah is not in the interest of any party, as it will directly and irrevocably drive the Yemeni population further into starvation and famine,\" U.N. aid chief Stephen O'Brien told the U.N. Security Council, urging all U.N. member states to help keep the port open and operating. \"Yemen now has the ignominy of being the world's largest food security crisis with more than 17 million people who are food insecure, 6.8 million of whom are one step away from famine. Crisis is not coming, it is not even looming, it is here today,\" he said. The Saudi-led coalition has said it was determined to help Yemen's government retake all areas held by Houthi militia, including Hodeidah port, but would ensure alternative entry routes for badly needed food and medicine. U.N. Yemen envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed told the Security Council on Tuesday he had made clear to the parties to the conflict that they must reach a compromise to avoid the \"horrific scenario\" of military action moving to the port (para. 1-6).

Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, made his comments on Twitter less than a week after Saudi Arabia and the UAE signaled frustration at Qatar. Its state media published purported remarks by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani criticizing Gulf rhetoric against Iran and suggesting strains between the emir and U.S. President Donald Trump. Tensions have been rising between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors, who accuse Tehran of trying to expand its influence in Arab countries including Syria and Yemen. Qatar denied making the critical comments, saying its news agency had been hacked, but Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates allowed their state-backed media to continue running the story, angering Doha. \"The Gulf Cooperation Council countries are passing through a new sharp crisis that carries within it a great danger,\" Gargash said. \"Fending off sedition lies in changing behavior, building trust and regaining credibility,\" he added, without mentioning Qatar by name. Gulf countries have made no official comment on the rift, which emerged after Trump's first visit to Saudi Arabia and his meetings with Arab and Muslim heads of state since he took office. But a war of words had escalated between Qatari media on one side and Saudi and Emirati media on the other. The row appears to emanate from old accusations made in 2014 that Qatar backs Islamists outlawed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE as terrorist organizations. Ties between Qatar and some of its GCC allies suffered an eight-month breakdown in 2014 over Qatar's alleged support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the political ideology of which challenges the principle of dynastic rule. The rift ended after what diplomats said at the time was a promise by Qatar to the UAE that the Muslim Brotherhood would not be allowed to operate from the country. Gargash said that the road to resolving any crisis \"between someone and his brothers was to have true intentions, abide by commitments, change the behavior that had caused damage and turn a new page\". \"Our position and our stability is in our unity and to have honest intentions,\" he added (para. 1-11).

Militants have been touring the southwestern city of Taiz in the build-up to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, putting up posters advertising the contest, residents reported. They encourage people to pick up the sheets from group members. Most of the questions focus on the organization's interpretation of Islam. \"Name three articles of the (Yemeni) constitution which contradict Islamic Law,\" read one on a sheet seen by Reuters. \"Any person who follows a law other than Islamic law is an infidel who must be killed. List three (scriptural) references for this,\" asked another. The first prize was a Chinese-made AK-47, the second a motorcycle and the third a laptop. Others included a pistol and cash prizes of 20,000 rials ($80). The sheets did not give details on where to submit entries, but residents told Reuters the group's offices and mosques in the city were widely known. Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch, one of the most active in the militant network, has taken advantage of the chaos in the Arabian Peninsula country to strengthen its positions, particularly in remote southern regions (para. 1-9).

The Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh should immediately cease using these weapons and observe the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which Yemen ratified in 1998. Houthi-Saleh forces have used landmines in at least six governorates since the Saudi Arabia-led coalition began military operations in support of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in March 2015. Mines appear to have killed and maimed hundreds of civilians and disrupted civilian life in affected areas. Landmines continue to pose a threat to civilians long after a conflict ends. \u201cHouthi-Saleh forces have been flouting the landmine ban at the expense of Yemeni civilians,\u201d Steve Goose, director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch, said. \u201cYemen prohibited antipersonnel mines nearly two decades ago and no authorities should tolerate their use.\u201d Human Rights Watch researchers visited the southern port city of Aden in early 2017, and interviewed and collected data from mine clearance experts, local security officials, landmine victims, and activists, and interviewed victims and activists in other governorates by phone. Human Rights Watch investigated 10 incidents where landmines laid by Houthi-Saleh forces in Sanaa, Marib, Aden, and Taizz governorates exploded, killing two people and wounding eight. While comprehensive landmine casualty figures are not available, health professionals and local activists provided lists of people wounded by landmines in several governorates. The Center for Prosthetic Limbs and Physiotherapy in Aden provided the names and ages of 24 people who had recently lost limbs to landmines. Against Mines National Organization reported that landmines killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 39 in two districts of Taizz governorate between May 2015 and April 2016. And the National Organization for Defending Rights and Freedoms (HOOD) documented cases in which more than 80 people were killed and 136 wounded by landmines in Marib and al-Jawf governorates since the conflict began. The Landmine Monitor initiative by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines reported that at least 988 people were killed or wounded by landmines or other explosive remnants of war in Yemen in 2015. Human Rights Watch previously documented Houthi-Saleh forces\u2019 use of antipersonnel mines in Aden, Abyan, Marib, Lahj, and Taizz governorates in 2015 and 2016, as well as their indiscriminate use of anti-vehicle mines (para. 1-8).

An announcement of the weapons sale had been anticipated last month, but objections by mostly Democratic lawmakers and human rights groups have complicated the matter, the U.S. officials and others close to the issue said. \"We want the Saudis to show that they are committed to use these things properly,\" said one U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At issue is the sale of about $390 million worth of guidance systems made by Raytheon Co that convert \"dumb\" gravity bombs into precision-guided munitions that are supposed to more accurately hit targets. Nearly 4,800 civilians have been killed in Yemen since the latest round of conflict began in March 2015, most of them by the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the United Nations human rights office said in March. The conflict pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by the Saudi-led Arab coalition. A representative of the Saudi Embassy in Washington declined comment on discussions with Washington over the precision-guided weapons. The Saudi government has called allegations of civilian casualties fabricated or exaggerated, and has said the coalition follows rigorous rules of engagement. A group of U.S. senators introduced legislation on April 13 to set new conditions for U.S. military support for Riyadh. \"The Saudis are important partners in the Middle East, but they have continued to disregard our advice when it comes to target selection and civilian protection,\" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said in a statement (para. 1-10).

At least 10,000 people have been killed and more than 3 million displaced in the war in Yemen, now in its third year. Millions of people are also struggling to feed themselves. \"We will have to overcome Iran's efforts to destabilize yet another country and create another militia in their image of Lebanese Hezbollah, but the bottom line is we are on the right path for it,\" Mattis told reporters in Riyadh after meeting senior Saudi officials. Mattis said the goal was for there to be a political solution through U.N.-brokered negotiations to resolve the conflict in Yemen. Officials have said the United States is considering deepening its role in the conflict in Yemen by more directly assisting its Gulf allies, who are fighting Iranian-supported Houthi rebels there. U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the situation in Yemen came up in their meetings with Saudi officials, including with King Salman and Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman. Officials said U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition was discussed including what more assistance the United States could provide, including potential intelligence support, saying they were weighing boosting the same type of support already being given.

The coalition, which has been fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels and troops loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh since 2015, on Sunday proposed that the U.N. monitor Hodeidah port after an attack on a boatload of Somali refugees killed 42 people. \"Parties to the conflict have a clear responsibility to protect civilian infrastructure and fundamentally to protect civilians.

The refugees had departed Hodeidah en route to Sudan on Friday when they came under fire in an incident that aid workers said had involved a helicopter. The Saudi-led coalition denied responsibility for the attack. The Red Sea port near the Bab al-Mandab strait is under the control of Yemen's armed Houthi movement. The Bab al-Mandab is a strategic waterway through which nearly 4 million barrels of oil are shipped daily. Haq said that with Yemen almost entirely dependent on importing food and other commodities it was \"essential that all parties to the conflict facilitate unhindered access to Yemen's ports for humanitarian and commercial cargo, including Hodeidah port, which serves 70 percent of Yemen's affected population.\"\nHodeidah is part of a broad battlefront where forces loyal to Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, are fighting the Houthi movement, which controls most of northern and western Yemen (para. 1-7).

Iran's enemy Saudi Arabia is leading a Sunni Arab coalition fighting the Houthis in the impoverished state on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula - part of the same regional power struggle that is fueling the war in Syria. Sources with knowledge of the military movements, who declined to be identified, say that in recent months Iran has taken a greater role in the two-year-old conflict by stepping up arms supplies and other support. This mirrors the strategy it has used to support its Lebanese ally Hezbollah in Syria.\nA senior Iranian official said Major General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Qods Force - the external arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - met top IRGC officials in Tehran last month to look at ways to \"empower\" the Houthis. \"At this meeting, they agreed to increase the amount of help, through training, arms and financial support,\" the official said. \"Yemen is where the real proxy war is going on and winning the battle in Yemen will help define the balance of power in the Middle East.\" Iran rejects accusations from Saudi Arabia that it is giving financial and military support to the Houthis in the struggle for Yemen, blaming the deepening crisis on Riyadh.

The Pentagon said the strikes, which were first reported by Reuters, targeted al Qaeda militants, heavy weapons systems, equipment, infrastructure and the group's fighting positions. They were carried out in the Yemeni governorates of Abyan, Al Bayda and Shabwah. \"The strikes will degrade the AQAP's ability to coordinate external terror attacks and limit their ability to use territory seized from the legitimate government of Yemen as a safe space for terror plotting,\" Navy Captain Jeff Davis said, using an acronym for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The strikes come a month since a Jan. 29 raid against AQAP. The operation, the first of its kind authorized by new President Donald Trump, was hailed as a success by the White House and other U.S. officials. Still, critics questioned the value and effectiveness of a mission which killed women and children, as well as several militants and a Navy SEAL. Trump, citing information from his defense secretary, told Congress on Tuesday that the raid yielded valuable intelligence that would \"lead to many more victories in the future.\" Still, one U.S. official suggested Thursday's strikes - which included use of U.S. drones and manned aircraft - had been in the planning stages before the January raid (para. 1-7).

The U.N. document cited and expanded upon a Reuters report in September that detailed the charges in Brazil against former executives at Taurus who allegedly shipped handguns in 2013 to Fares Mohammed Hassan Mana'a, a Yemeni arms smuggler sanctioned for dealings around the Horn of Africa for more than a decade.\nU.N. experts on the conflict in Yemen said an investigation turned up several red flags in the sale of the handguns, which were registered for use in Djibouti but allegedly destined for black markets in the region. Authorities in Saudi Arabia seized an arms shipment in November 2015 before it got to Djibouti, on suspicion the arms were bound for Houthi forces fighting a Saudi-backed coalition in Yemen, according to the report. \"Had Taurus ... exercised due diligence then they would have identified aspects of this arms purchase that were suspicious in relation to the targeted arms embargo on Yemen, and could have stopped the shipment,\" wrote the experts. Responding to the U.N. report, the gun maker told Reuters in an email that the transaction followed all protocols required by Brazilian and international law, and the company halted any further shipments involving Djibouti after learning of concerns about the deal.\n\"Taurus had no grounds to distrust the buyers,\" it said. The U.N. report questioned why an end-user certificate from Djibouti cleared the transfer of up to 80,000 pistols to the Ministry of Defense, when the country's armed forces consist of just 16,000 active personnel and 9,500 reservists (para. 1-8).

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama had decided to let it become law without his signature.\n\"The administration has, and continues to use, all of the necessary authorities to waive the relevant sanctions\" lifted as part of the nuclear deal, Earnest said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has 10 days after Congress passes a bill to sign it, veto it or do nothing. If Congress has adjourned, failing to sign it is a \"pocket veto\" that prevents the bill from becoming law. But if Congress is still in session, the bill becomes law with no signature. Although lawmakers have returned home for the holidays, Congress technically is still in session and holding \"pro-forma\" sessions this week.\nThough Obama's move doesn't prevent the sanctions renewal from entering force, it marked a symbolic attempt by the president to demonstrate disapproval for lawmakers' actions. The White House has argued that the renewal is unnecessary because the administration retains other authorities to punish Iran, if necessary, and has expressed concern that the renewal may undermine the nuclear deal (para 1-5).

The kits, if purchased over the life of the proposed contract, are valued around $350 million.\nBut administration officials said that upgrading the bombs would not help targeting if the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen did not choose its targets properly, an ongoing concern since the start of bombing campaign. This year, the United States blocked a sale of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia because of similar concerns.\nThe administration\u2019s decision is a setback for Raytheon, which officials say pushed hard for approval of the sale. Administration officials said that Raytheon\u2019s chief executive, Thomas A. Kennedy, personally lobbied Tony Blinken, the deputy secretary of state, and also reached out to Secretary of State John Kerry and Susan Rice, the national security adviser. It was unclear if he connected with Mr. Kerry or Ms. Rice.\nJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the Obama administration has \u201clong expressed some very significant concerns about the high rate of civilian casualties\u201d in the Yemeni conflict. Administration officials pointed to the bombing in October of a funeral hall in Yemen that killed over 100 people and wounded hundreds of others. The Saudi-led military coalition involved in Yemen\u2019s war acknowledged that one of its jets carried out the attack, for which it blamed faulty intelligence (para. 1-5).  Cooper, B. (2016).

President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi on Saturday rejected the envoy's peace plan, saying it would reward the Houthis for seizing the capital and \"opens a door towards more suffering and war\".\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/yemen-thousands-protest-envoy-peace-plan-161103140021988.html"], [12406, "2016-11-08T00:13:16Z", [0.1], "secret"], [368, "2016-11-07T22:14:18Z", [0.0], ""], [601, "2016-11-07T21:31:10Z", [0.06], ""], [691, "2016-11-07T20:47:22Z", [0.02], ""], [22243, "2016-11-07T18:09:20Z", [0.03], ""], [26762, "2016-11-07T15:27:26Z", [0.25], ""], [6303, "2016-11-07T00:23:28Z", [0.05], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2016-11-06T21:28:57Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-05T20:10:14Z", [0.0], ""], [30030, "2016-11-05T19:48:56Z", [0.05], ""], [13390, "2016-11-05T18:30:23Z", [0.2], "Still to much unrest in the region."], [29266, "2016-11-05T13:29:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-04T18:08:55Z", [0.0], ""], [20014, "2016-11-04T04:46:59Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2016-11-03T20:32:20Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-03T19:32:37Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2016-11-03T16:45:43Z", [0.3], ""], [29972, "2016-11-03T08:19:10Z", [0.55], ""], [29206, "2016-11-02T23:41:56Z", [0.85], ""], [14777, "2016-11-02T23:17:29Z", [0.12], ""], [368, "2016-11-02T21:04:27Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-02T19:12:47Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-11-01T19:46:42Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-01T18:55:57Z", [0.0], ""], [29899, "2016-11-01T11:21:48Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2016-10-31T20:28:59Z", [0.0], ""], [476, "2016-10-31T19:52:29Z", [0.0], "Understanding the background  link http://www.wsj.com/articles/yemen-rebels-saudi-arabia-begin-peace-talks-to-end-nearly-year-long-war-1457520050 link  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/houthi-rebels-reject-draft-peace-plan-160801155358420.html and link  http://www.voanews.com/a/united-nations-suspends-yemen-peace-negotiations/3453869.html     the UN decides to end the \"negotiations\"\n"], [691, "2016-10-31T19:51:57Z", [0.02], ""], [26759, "2016-10-31T19:37:28Z", [0.15], ""], [10759, "2016-10-31T17:38:12Z", [0.08], ""], [4634, "2016-10-31T17:38:01Z", [0.08], ""], [601, "2016-10-31T16:57:35Z", [0.0], ""], [26227, "2016-10-31T15:20:44Z", [0.28], ""], [21514, "2016-10-31T14:52:38Z", [0.75], ""], [29868, "2016-10-31T08:38:34Z", [0.2], ""], [23006, "2016-10-31T04:39:14Z", [0.0], ""], [1450, "2016-10-31T02:59:15Z", [0.02], ""], [6303, "2016-10-31T01:35:11Z", [0.05], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2016-10-30T22:22:10Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-30T19:04:07Z", [0.02], "At the moment, partition looks more likely than unification.
