Ms. Nielsen, who is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has drafted a resignation letter but has not submitted it, according to two of the people. As the head of the Department of Homeland Security,. . . .\n. . . \nTyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, disputed that Ms. Nielsen had drafted a resignation letter and was close to resigning, calling those assertions \u201cfalse.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about immigration has grown in recent weeks, according to several officials. He repeatedly claimed credit for the fact that during his first year in office, illegal border crossings dropped to their lowest levels in decades. But this year, they have risen again, robbing him of one of his favorite talking points. In remarks to reporters before Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Trump hinted at the anger that would cause him to erupt once TV cameras were led out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve very much toughened up the border, but the laws are horrible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe laws in this country for immigration and illegal immigration are absolutely horrible. And we have to do something about it \u2014 not only the wall, which we\u2019re building sections of wall right now.\u201d\n. . . \nDuring the meeting, Mr. Trump yelled about the United States\u2019 porous border and said more needed to be done to fix it. When members of his cabinet pointed out that the country relies on day laborers who cross the border each day, Mr. Trump said that was fine, but continued to complain, one person said. The president also complained about the continued failure of his administration to find a way to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, two people familiar with the episode said. Ms. Nielsen viewed the president\u2019s rant as directed mostly at her, and she told associates after the meeting that she should not continue in the job if he did not view her as effective. One person close to Ms. Nielsen said she was miserable in her job. Mr. Trump has clashed with Ms. Nielsen for weeks about his belief that more should be done to secure the border. In early April, the president repeatedly expressed frustration with Ms. Nielsen that her department was not doing enough to close loopholes that were allowing illegal immigrants into the country, according to one official familiar with those discussions. During those discussions, officials had presented Mr. Trump with a list of proposals that would help border agents crack down on those trying to cross the border illegally and send them back more quickly. The president urged Ms. Nielsen to be more aggressive, the official said. One persistent issue has been Mr. Trump\u2019s belief that Ms. Nielsen and other officials in the department were resisting his direction that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into the United States, several officials said. The president and his aides in the White House had been pushing a family separation policy for weeks as a way of deterring families from trying to cross the border illegally.\n. . . \nThe episode at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday is the latest evidence of staff turmoil at the White House, where many of Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers have either been fired or have resigned in recent weeks. The president fired Rex W. Tillerson, his secretary of state, and pushed out Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his second national security adviser, replacing him with John R. Bolton, who in turn fired several top aides at the National Security Council. Those staff changes followed the announced departures of Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s top economic adviser in the White House, and Hope Hicks, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s communications director and confidante. Thomas P. Bossert, the president\u2019s homeland security adviser, also quit. Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Mr. Kelly, who was the president\u2019s first secretary of homeland security, has also soured in recent months as the president has grown weary of Mr. Kelly\u2019s attempts to impose order on his White House operations. Ms. Nielsen was Mr. Kelly\u2019s chief of staff at the Homeland Security Department, and followed Mr. Kelly to the White House when he became chief of staff. She frequently clashed with other members of the president\u2019s staff as she and Mr. Kelly sought to end the chaotic access to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump later nominated Ms. Nielsen to be the new homeland security secretary on Mr. Kelly\u2019s recommendation. Even so, people close to Mr. Trump said he viewed her with suspicion because she had spent years working for President George W. Bush as a homeland security aide and later as a top official for the Transportation Security Administration in the Homeland Security Department.\n"], [15196, "2018-05-11T04:03:03Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [58253, "2018-05-11T02:29:37Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-11T02:23:11Z", [0.45, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [37512, "2018-05-11T01:15:51Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.35, 0.2], ""], [35636, "2018-05-11T01:01:33Z", [0.1, 0.52, 0.35, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [56141, "2018-05-11T00:03:39Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.12, 0.03, 0.0], "I started with a base rate of 0.3 cabinet level official per month and I eyeballed the rest"], [31450, "2018-05-10T18:56:57Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "While turnover in the trump administration is a given and there are always people under threat, I am going very low given the tight time frame of the question."], [16851, "2018-05-10T18:22:15Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-05-10T16:00:31Z", [0.25, 0.35, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-05-10T15:31:12Z", [0.25, 0.35, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-10T11:41:22Z", [0.34, 0.42, 0.24, 0.0, 0.0], "The big bloodbath is probably over.
