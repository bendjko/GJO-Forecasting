Giving the example of Venezuela is helpful because Venezuela is from the same region with similar problems to Nicaragua- state run corruption, low economy,issues with law enforcement and daily disrespect of human rights, etc. Despite having different reasons which made both presidents to be seen by (part of) their citizens as illegitimate rulers, it is giving a significant analytical contrast  for measuring how possible it is realistically currently Daniel Ortega to cease to be a president of Nicaragua before/after or in similar time with Venezualian President Nicolas Maduro. Moreover, as per today (17th May) Nicaragua seems to be a left out blind spot for the attention of politicians and all international attention of powers such as the US, UK, China, and even EU is consumed by other issues (Brexit, Venezuela, European elections, China, Boeing vs Airbus, etc, etc,) leaving Nicaragua to manage on itself without external pressures. The external pressures are important in measuring to what extent it is possible Ortega to leave his office at any point, not just in July. But with the interest being low in terms of Nicaragua and practically no external pressure except from NGOs, Ortega is in a more or less safe position to not be removed from power before July 2019. Some questions I think someone more proficient in Latin American politics can answer are:\n1. Why is Nicaragua less important than Venezuela?\n2.

This reform was put in place as a result of the Sandinista's decade long misuse of funds which left the government insolvent. In addition, President Ortega has take steps over the years to slowly dismantle the country's democracy by stealing elections, reforming the constitution to his benefit, and bribing major media outlets. His actions have left citizens protesting for his removal, and the international community has done the same with the US placing sanctions on the country. Although there have been mass protests by citizens and condemnation by other countries, is is very unlikely that Ortega will cease to be president as he has remained in power unchallenged with the support of the Nicaraguan police and a gang known as the Sandinista Youth.

President Ortega made changes to the constitution in 2006 in order to stay in office, and despite negative backlash from the public, he continues to fight for power. Since April of 2018, many protesters have died in uprisings calling for Ortega to leave office, and those protests have been met with military force. The protests are composed of people who are multi-ethnic, come from separate political factions as well as economic backgrounds, and the international community has condemned the actions of the government of Nicaragua. Despite condemnation and backlash from thousands of people from the country, Ortega continues to use military and political power to hold his seat. He used his immunity to prevent trial for allegations of child abuse from his step-daughter, and has also shown many other instances of high-level corruption. Because Ortega is willing to go to extremes to remain president and to have this position of power, it is unlikely that he will leave office within one year. Due to the unstable nature and violence insinuated by the protests, it is unlikely that the movement will make an effect until there is a uniting force, which is unlikely before July of 2019. It is unlikely because although businesses have began to feel the effects of the corruption from the presidency, they do not have that much of a voice in Nicaragua because it's one of the poorest countries in Nicaragua. The widespread poverty does not allow for a strong business influence in stopping Ortega, so although they are against Ortega, external influence needs to be implemented. Based off history of international institutions and intervention, in order for them to act, the crisis needs to be more widespread, or national interests of powerful states must be aligned with the politics of Nicaragua. Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has not had interests in Nicaragua because the military is no longer aimed at combating communists, but instead terrorists. Other powerful world actors have not indicated interests in Nicaragua either, so it is unlikely there will be an intervention besides sanctions before escalation, which is unlikely to happen until protests become more organized and widespread, which will not happen before July of 2019 due to the chaos in the organization of protests and violence happening currently. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44398673\nhttps://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23481&LangID=E\n"], [34725, "2018-10-02T10:12:34Z", [0.04], ""], [4066, "2018-10-02T02:24:03Z", [0.05], ""], [82, "2018-10-02T00:44:55Z", [0.1], ""], [1646, "2018-10-01T14:33:49Z", [0.18], ""], [61323, "2018-10-01T13:44:15Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Oct 01, 2018 07:12PM UTC"], [691, "2018-10-01T11:41:22Z", [0.01], ""], [19801, "2018-10-01T01:44:40Z", [0.0], "The oil prices is at the highest it has been.

In the early 2000s, Venezuela was one of Latin America\u2019s richest countries. Ch\u00e1vez used his economic brawn to support allies in Cuba, Argentina, Ecuador and Brazil by sending them financial aid and cheap crude. Venezuela offered the Ortega regime unusually favorable terms of trade. His government paid 50 percent of the cost of each shipment within 90 days of receipt. The remainder was due within 23 years and financed at 2 percent interest. This cheap fuel was distributed at market prices by Nicaragua\u2019s government gas company, DNP. The government\u2019s nice profit margin helped spur a period of remarkable economic growth in Nicaragua. Between 2007 and 2016, Ortega\u2019s government spent nearly 40 percent of oil proceeds to bolster ambitious social welfare programs, including micro-financing for small businesses, food for the hungry and subsidized housing for the poor. These initiatives contributed to significant poverty reductions across Nicaragua, earning Ortega and his Sandinista party widespread popular support. Between 2007 and 2017, Nicaragua\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an average of 4.1 percent a year. The boom peaked in 2012, with a stunning 6.4 percent growth in GDP.
