Pakistan is also deliberately targeting Afghanistan\u2019s ethnic harmony by orchestrating terrorist attacks and killing Hazaras; to polarize the Afghan society on lines of the Pashtun and the non-Pashtun. Without open discussions, countermeasures and accommodation, this is recipe for more instability. According to Dr Moradian, \u201cFailure to manage ethnic politics is one of the drivers of socioeconomic underdevelopment, ethnic and civil wars, state collapse, ethnic cleansing and even genocide\u201d. To compound the problems, the Taliban offensive and influence doesn\u2019t appear to be abating either.

Seeks Alternate for Electoral Reforms Amid Setbacks, July 28, 2016\nhttp://www.outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=15830 KABUL - The Afghan government is likely to announce an alternate to implementing electoral reforms after the Wolesi Jirga's (Lower House of Parliament) recent rejection of President Ashraf Ghani's second legislative decree on the issue. This has however, scuppered the hopes of monitoring groups and the Afghan public that reforms in the election system would take place. Government is expected to announce a second option for election reforms by the end of the week, the Office of the Chief Executive Officer of the National Unity Government Abdullah Abdullah said in a statement on Wednesday. No details as to what the alternate is was given. Election monitoring groups have warned that domestic and international criticism against government is likely to grow if the so-called new option for election reforms again hits a deadlock. \"Electoral reforms constitutes one of the key promises of government which also motivated us to consult the House of Representatives for help; however we faced deadlocks in our attempt; but government will announce the next step by the end of the week and then details will be shared with the media,\" said Maisam Umid, deputy spokesman for the CEO. Both the presidency and the CEO's office have rejected rumors over disagreements between the president and the CEO regarding the electoral reforms issue.\nHowever, monitoring groups claim government does not have the political will to reform the law. \"The electoral reform process is one of the priorities in line with the political agreement (signed at the establishment of the national unity government), however no practical steps have been taken until now and we are massively concerned about the approach; if a similar track continues, international pressure and outrage among opposition forces will likely increase,\" said Mohammad Naeem Ayoubzada, head of the Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan. Meanwhile, members of the public have also blasted government over constant delays that have hit the much-awaited process. \"According to the law, the decree is already implemented. The government has the legal authority to undertake its job whether it is electoral reforms or any other job but keeping in mind the time the decree was issue. When the MPs return from the summer recess, government can resend the decree to parliament for approval,\" MP Ghulam Farooq Majroh said. The European Union and foreign donors have said that they will not provide financial assistance to Afghanistan's election management bodies unless the reforms are effected in the elections law.(Tolonews)\n================================================================================================ Positive developments but doubts remain!

The compromise brokered by the US government in 2014 relative to the outcome of the presidential election now reaches a deadline exists linked to the reform of the Afghan electoral processes (Katzman, 2016). In April of 2016 a top elected official holding the post of the head of the Independent Election Commission (IEC). Yusuf Nuristani, resigned his post some three months after the announcement of the postponed parliamentary elections in October, for the Wolesi Jirga (Lower House) and District Council. The current power dynamics and the main stumbling block for the elections exists relative to two elements of the National Unity Government\u2019s (NUG) political agreement. The Special Electoral Reform Commission (SERC) created in June of 2015, which exists tasked with moving forward with recommendations for electoral reform; and the Independent Election Complaints Commission (IECC) and its creation of a new electoral system (Sharan, 2016). Nevertheless, in December 2015, both exists voted down by the Wolesi Jirga, thus creating a tension between the NUG and parliament. President Ghani in response to the rejection of the Wolesi Jirga\u2019s vote issues a reform outlining the authority, structure and duties of the Afghan electoral bodies with his Presidential decree in March 2016. Which lacks the comprehensive recommendations of the SERC and simplistically reduces, discussion of electoral reform to a superficial change relative only to the structures of the IEC and the IECC (Sharan, 2016). Sharan (2016) states that: If one optimistically assumes that the upcoming parliamentary elections do take place this year, two fundamental, immediate concerns must be addressed: how to increase the IEC\u2019s credibility and how to decrease the likelihood of fraud, manipulation, and a contested outcome. The former will partly be addressed through the Selection Committee, which is tasked to find new commissioners (\u00b6 7). Continuing to face daunting economic and political issues, Afghanistan; also faces an increasing challenge of its authority relative to the Taliban insurgency which openly challenges the State and the electoral process. Holding their press conferences March 2016, the IEC, officially proclaim and specified Oct 15, 2016 as the election-day for the Wolesi Jirga and District Councils\u2019 elections. Nevertheless, the IEC also for the purpose of implementing the programs respectfully requested funds from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan government; a 50% budget relative to the above aforementioned elections. To date the NUG in preparation of the timely conduct elections have not announced their support in the form of a budget as of yet.

The independence they share is amazing. Afghans KNOW our children shed our blood for Them. They want Honest Government. They know it may take many elections to get the right representation. They risk life and limb, night letters by Criminal Taliban in remote areas and still they vote.  You will never be left behind by being Positive. I was in Panjwai a day or two after one of our soldiers entered a village alone and murdered sixteen unarmed villagers, 3/2012. The message to you, I, America; Please tell your families, your Mothers we are Mothers too, we know you lost your children in sacrifice to Afghanistan. Please know that OUR village understands these things happen in WAR. We know ALL Americans are not this WAY. He was troubled. WE UNDERSTAND. This message from parents and relatives of those killed, as they prepared their burials.  You watch how many women vote. You watch how many women are elected to higher office. The connection to First Lady Laura B. and Bamyan is a great story as well. Three of the ladies in Bamyan are personal friends of pres 43 and Laura. They have visited the Whitehouse three times and Laura 43 has been to see them as many times. Laura 43 new Book about Bamyan features them.  You and I need to learn networking as it applies to elections. Womens make far better detectives, ask my wife she has been married to a cop for 36 years. Twitter got its start from Iran uprising, women texting women....they keep in touch socially around the world. If American women do something it will take hold in middle east or eastern Europe. That is not an accident. As it applies to our conversation, the ones to pose your question to are the women on your team. If there are no women on your team you do not stand a chance.  I have worked alongside the smartest women in Law Enforcement. They are absolutely intuitive by design, as much as men are skeptical about, say, Human Nature.  I trained many of first FET (Female Engagement Teams) in Afghanistan, it was successful from start because it is women empowering women.. We (men) are fixers. Women get the big picture. My wife is on her game when I am absent. My job is to gather (food) Money. She cuts it up makes sure the grandkids get fed, bills get paid.

The overhaul of the Afghan electoral system prior to a new parliamentary election was a key part of the post-election power-sharing deal reached between President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Whilst both agree in not holding an election before the process is overhauled, there is disagreement on how to proceed and who should oversee the process. Ghani's recommendation of Shukria Barakzai for the post was rejected by Abdullah, who saw her as being too close to Ghani. Simultaneously Abdullah has also been strongly opposed to the same officials overseeing the election as oversaw the 2014 Presidential election, due in part to the widespread belief that Ghani benefited from the 2014 elections irregularities compared to Abdullah. Tying into this is the fact that no officials from the election have been charged with any crime or removed. In contrast to Abdullah's more hardline calls for total overhaul, Ghani's supporters have been more supportive of more limited reforms. Issues to be addressed\nOne of the major issues in need of reform has been voter registration. Afghan voters are currently not limited to voting in particular areas, meaning that they can use their 2001-issued voting cards in any polling station. Simultaneously there have been 3 major registrations since 2001, resulting in a total of 20 million election cards being distributed. In contrast, Afghanistan only has an estimated 12 million voters, making the number of cards in circulation a source of potential fraud. Introducing an electronic identity system is a difficult process however, with some estimating it may take up to 10 years. The continuing failure to set a date for new elections or reform the system led to the United Nations Development Programme to cancel a multimillion-dollar project to fund Afghan electoral bodies in June 2015. The cut came at a time when Afghan aid projects were coming under increased scrutiny. On July 16, and following a 9-month delay, Ghani issued a decree establishing a 16-member commission to look into electoral reform.  The parliaments term expired on 22 June 2015, leading President Ghani to issue a decree extending the parliament until new elections. By August 2015 the commission had begun looking at the issue of voting reform. Electoral Reform Commission proposals\nOn Sunday 30 August 2015 the Electoral Reform Commission submitted their proposals, following a month of deliberation. Amongst the proposals were calls for allotting 83, or 1/3, of the Afghan parliaments 250 seats to political parties, in accordance with the parties national results. Other proposals included the restructuring of the current election commission; the creation of a clear voter identification system ahead of future polling; and moving to an electoral system that divides provinces into smaller voting districts that can be easily quarantined in case of fraud. According to the New York Times, observers felt that the proposals weighed towards the view of reform favored by Abdullah Abdullah.\n========"], [691, "2016-05-12T14:42:04Z", [0.34], ""], [3895, "2016-05-12T14:17:52Z", [0.32], "initial forecast.
