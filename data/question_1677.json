Covid likely reduced construction of fast charging stations due to supply chain disruption and workplace social distancing.  Tesla also reported rebounds in the usage of the supercharger network following the first collapse in usage at covid outbreak, which might suggest that construction of new stations remains a priority.  However, Tesla doesn't build all the public fast ev charging stations, so the growth rate is likely to be closer to the overall historical 20% rate and that rate (combined with the current AFDC data) translates to 4200 stations at year end.  The net effect of covid should be to push that downward.  More downward pressure could result from the unexpected fall in EV sales in 2019, although that effect could be counterbalanced (in part) because charging infrastructure is a long range proposition.
