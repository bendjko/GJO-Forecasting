What is the impact of a weaker yuan? \u201cA weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more competitive, or cheaper to buy with foreign currencies. From the U.S. perspective, it is seen as an attempt to offset the impact of higher tariffs on Chinese imports coming into America. A weaker yuan will also make imports into China more expensive, potentially driving up inflation and creating strains in its already slowing economy, as well as pushing currency holders to invest in other assets\u201d (BBC, 2019).

(XE, 2020). In the past year, the yuan has fluctuated between 7.15 and 6.75, meaning it is only slightly below its highest value. COVID seems to have little impact on the value of the yuan, which gained 0.1 against the dollar in the first week of March (XE, 2020). It is surprising that the yuan has been so stable, considering recent actions against Huawei and general global resentment against China for the coronavirus.  In fact, in the last ten years, it has only fluctuated between 6.05 and 7.15, its lowest value (which occurred in May of this year). That doesn\u2019t seem like much, but consider how China can move its currency to, for example, negate the effect of tariffs: \u201cThe recent decline in the value of the yuan largely nullifies the threatened tariff. Here\u2019s the basic math: If a US importer buys $100 worth of goods from China when the exchange rate is 6.3 yuan to the dollar, that\u2019s 630 yuan. If the exchange rate changes to 7, as it just did, then the US importer only needs $90 for the same purchase. If that import is then subject to a 10 percent tariff, the two cancel each other out and the cost to the importer remains basically the same.\u201d (Karabell, 2019) Having said that, no recent tariffs have been put into effect, and there seems to be nothing for China to respond to via monetary policy at the present. The period of prediction is only ten days as of this writing.  Given the yuan is near its highest value, it is more likely to decline than to rise.  In the last week, the difference between the high and low of the yuan is 0.06.  I believe the closing value of the yuan on 13 November will be 1 USD to 6.85 yuan, with a confidence level of 40% at that mark.  A result of 6.75 to 6.95 has a confidence level of 90%.
