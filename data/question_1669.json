First UAE nuclear reactor reaches full power\n07 December 2020 Barakah unit 1 has reached 100% power and is now generating 1400 MW of electricity, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has announced today. The unit, which is operated by Nawah Energy Company (Nawah), is now the single largest power generator in the UAE and is due to begin commercial operations early next year.

Retrieved from\nhttps://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/First-UAE-nuclear-reactor-reaches-full-power Achieving 100% power is one of the final steps of the Power Ascension Testing (PAT) phase of the start-up process for Unit 1. Nawah\u2019s highly skilled and certified nuclear operators will carry out a series of tests before the reactor is safely shut down in preparation for the Check Outage. During this period, the Unit 1 systems will be carefully examined, and any planned or corrective maintenance will be performed to maintain its safety, reliability and efficiency prior to the commencement of commercial operations. Eng. Ali Al Hammadi, Chief Executive Officer of Nawah, said: \u201cThis is a key achievement for the UAE, as we safely work through the start-up process for Unit 1 of the Barakah plant. Successfully reaching 100% of the rated power capacity in a safe and controlled manner, undertaken by our highly trained and certified nuclear operators, demonstrates our commitment to safe, secure and sustainable operations as we now advance towards our final maintenance activities and prepare for commercial operations in 2021.\u201d \nUAE achieves 1400MW of Clean Electricity as Barakah Unit 1 reaches 100% Power\n07.12.20\nhttps://www.enec.gov.ae/news/latest-news/uae-achieves-1400mw-of-clean-electricity-as-barakah-unit-1-reaches-full-power/"], [529, "2020-12-20T19:14:36Z", [0.0], ""], [206, "2020-12-20T18:05:58Z", [0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-12-20T12:00:37Z", [0.0], ""], [87064, "2020-12-19T18:10:59Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-19T15:56:00Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-12-19T03:47:47Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-12-18T19:41:34Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-12-17T22:47:31Z", [0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-12-16T20:15:06Z", [0.0], ""], [25141, "2020-12-16T17:08:08Z", [0.0], ""], [87440, "2020-12-15T19:09:31Z", [0.0], ""], [529, "2020-12-13T17:44:52Z", [0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-12-13T15:31:44Z", [0.0], ""], [96935, "2020-12-13T10:05:28Z", [0.0], ""], [67609, "2020-12-12T17:50:03Z", [0.0], "Going with the flow... what a turn of events!"], [87889, "2020-12-12T15:23:53Z", [0.0], ""], [96791, "2020-12-11T20:14:05Z", [0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-12-11T17:50:26Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2020-12-11T15:56:45Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-10T19:37:34Z", [0.0], ""], [97203, "2020-12-10T13:06:42Z", [0.0], ""], [783, "2020-12-09T22:43:09Z", [0.0], "https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/First-UAE-nuclear-reactor-reaches-full-power"], [1034, "2020-12-09T18:47:16Z", [0.0], ""], [529, "2020-12-09T00:46:31Z", [0.0], "Article indicates \"...commercial operations set to begin early next year\". https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/601116"], [81567, "2020-12-08T23:40:42Z", [0.0], "https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleViewAmp.html%3fidxno=56420"], [1034, "2020-12-08T20:10:05Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-08T17:29:19Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-12-08T14:12:37Z", [0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-12-07T17:29:02Z", [0.03], ""], [91142, "2020-12-07T03:14:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-12-06T22:27:22Z", [0.0], ""], [64, "2020-12-06T20:13:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-06T13:52:32Z", [0.05], ""], [22689, "2020-12-06T01:30:25Z", [0.0], ""], [529, "2020-12-05T18:07:12Z", [0.02], ""], [88010, "2020-12-04T16:38:04Z", [0.0], ""], [783, "2020-12-04T06:55:01Z", [1.0], ""], [88010, "2020-12-03T21:34:30Z", [0.0], ""], [89135, "2020-12-03T21:13:45Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-12-03T20:29:54Z", [0.05], ""], [88452, "2020-12-03T20:23:46Z", [0.0], "The aggregation algorithm, which has obviously been changed by the GJO on demand of a few forecasters, now appears to be overly sensitive.\nCompared to what happened to the consensus between yesterday and today, the aggregation - using the former method - would now be at 75% or maybe 80%.

[1] My understanding is that power ascension testing must be completed before the plant start supplying electricity. [2] The IAEA commissioning guideline for nuclear power plants says that \"Successful completion of core physics tests, power ascension tests and other plant acceptance tests may take six months or more from initial core loading and removal of the shutdown guarantee. During this initial period of operation, it is normal practice to plan a short outage (e.g. one month) or multiple short outages to clear all items still unresolved.\" [3] I'm not clear on what core loading means but I think it's synonymous with fuel loading (could also mean reaching criticality, which hasn't happened yet at Barakah afaik). So 6 months from March (September) would be the minimum amount of time if I understand the terminology correctly. However, if core loading refers to reaching criticality, Barakah likely won't open by 2021 as I can't find a source saying that criticality has been achieved (in May the CEO of ENEC said that criticality was \"a couple weeks or a month or so\" away). [4] Relevant historical background: there are 2 APR-1400's currently being used, both built by KEPCO (wikipedia lists Shin-Hanul 1 as operational but I don't think this is true, see [6]). [5] It took 12 and 4 months for the plants to open after first reaching criticality. [6] TL;DR: Given that 2021 is 5.5 months away, criticality likely hasn't occurred, and it takes an expected 8 months to open a plant after criticality is reached, I'm not confident Barakah unit 1 will be operational by the deadline.

Construction of the Barakah plant began in April 2013. According to an analysis based on data released by the IAEA, the world\u2019s foremost nuclear watchdog, it takes an average of 7.5 years to build a nuclear power plant. Taking this average, we could expect the plant to be finished by September 2020 which gives us a clue to the January 2021 time element contained in the question. [1] Construction, however, was ahead of schedule on the basis of this timeline nearing 94 percent readiness in May 2020 despite numerous delays. The same month, Nawah Energy, the holding company for the Barakah power plant clarified that the coronavirus pandemic had not delayed plans for Unit 1 (of 4) to go online in \u2018weeks or months\u2019. Testing on Units 2, 3 and 4 was at 95, 92 and 84 percent respectively at this same time. [2] With COVID cases in the UAE on a downward trajectory, there is some hope that things could be on the mend, with experts predicting a full recovery by 2022.

With one unit close to operational and even assuming an almost six month delay, I am assigning a 74 percent-\u201dProbable\u201d-rating as a starting forecast. Feedback is always welcome.
