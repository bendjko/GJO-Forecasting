Also, allegations of embezzlement by Le Pen while a member of the EU Parliament are beginning to get at least some coverage. \n The poll drop appears to be at a very steep angle on the Wikipedia polling summary graph.  However, how far will it go? \n There is a debate on Wednesday.  The reviews from the 2017 Macron-Le Pen debate had Macron as the overwhelming winner.  I could not find information on how the polls changed after the debate. \n Nevertheless, Macron I suspect will win Wednesday\u2019s debate.  Le Pen has tried to re-invent herself as more moderate.  I suspect the French are not buying it.  \n I think Le Pen's current polling average, which appears to be about 43-44 percent. (Look at the actual numbers.  The graph is an average and does not give enough weight to the most recent numbers.) \n I suspect Le Pen's numbers will drop between another two and ten percent if I had to guess a 90 percent interval.  The range is eight percent so 43-44 percent adjusted for this range gives 41-42 to 35-36 percent.  The mid-point is about 38-39 percent.  However, the lower the numbers go, the more hard-core Le Pen's support.  So maybe 40-41 percent is a better guess.    \n  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/04/french-election-marine-le-pen-and-emmanuel-macron-trade-insults-in-tv-debate\u00a0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_French_presidential_election#Second_round"], [94837, "2022-04-20T05:17:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [38, "2022-04-20T03:39:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.45, 0.05], "I was challenged by @tabhuth\u00a0about my 0% forecast for over 50% (thank \u00a0you!). \u00a0Reconsidering my forecast . . .\u00a0 \u00a0I noticed that another forecaster said that her odds of winning were 15% (I don't remember who, or what their information source was for that statement), so that the odds for 50+ should be 15%.

He has just held a poll of his voters where a large part went to abstentions.  But he made point of saying no one should vote for LePen even if Macron is also a bad choice https://f24.my/8YbK. So it feels like it would be hard to pick up a lot of this 22pc. The remainder of the vote at 26pc could go anywhere.  But if people don\u2019t like the choice will they vote at all.  22pc abstained on the first round.  This could go down if people are disaffected,  it up if people feel strongly against LePen (or Macron), so I think vote levels will be about the same or a bit down. Let\u2019s start with LePens first round 23pc.  If we assume LePen can pick up Zemmour\u2019s 7pc this would give her 30pc.  So I give this as the minimum.

He also considered the pro-right candidates who asked their voters not to vote Le Pen in the second round.  The polls show 53.5 percent for Macron and 46.5 percent for Le Pen.  Silver put Le Pen's chance of winning at 10 to 15 percent.  Silver also noted a contradiction.  The polls in Europe tend to be fairly accurate per a 538 study, yet Le Pen did 5 points worse and Macron 5 points better in the 2017 election than the polling.    Yet, I found his overall argument convincing that Le Pen has a slight chance of winning.    It should also be noted Macron began campaigning very late during the first round so his poll numbers will likely rise.   I found less convincing the articles on such things as  Macron's COVID policies and Le Pen's and Macron\u2019s  move to the center because the polls probably already account for these. Yet, there was a brand new story this morning about Le Pen misappropriating \u20ac 600,000 in public funds while a member of the European Parliament.  This could be devastating.   I was wondering how seriously to take these articles.  The oldest story is only 23 hours old and was published in a relatively unknown newspaper.  The major news outlets have not yet started to publish similar articles, except for DW news and the Guardian.  I was wondering if this suggested it was one of the stories that only outlets like Fox News, the Washington Examiner, the New York Post and OAN cover in the USA.  However, the Guardian and DW are reputable so there is probably something to it.  I guess the trick is to establish a 90-percent ceiling and floor if the election were held today and afterward consider the effects, if any, of the scandal . The absolute floor  should probably be the 32 percent of the pro-right vote in the first round.   I suspect she would get nearly all of those votes today. The absolute ceiling, despite Silver's statement that Le Pen could win, is likely less than 50 percent.  I understand some of the 62 percent who voted pro-left in the first round will not vote for Macron because they are angry with his COVID policies and move toward the center.  A 62 percent vote would leave Le Pen with a 38 percent ceiling.   That is an unlikely ceiling.   However, Macron started campaigning late (and he is probably very good or he would not be the incumbent), and therefore, the 53.5 percent is probably his floor.   Hence, Le Pen's 90 percent ceiling is probably around 46.5 percent.   The mid-point is 39.25 percent, right now.   The embezzlement case could backfire and help Le Pen if it is widely reported and turns out to be false. Yet, I think the EU prosecutors are probably non-partisan and conservative in cases like Le Pen's.   Therefore, the allegations will likely be deemed credible and harm her.   A 90 percent range for the harm the allegations could do, according to my best guess, is zero to 15 percent with a 7 percent mid-point.  Therefore, my new mid-point  becomes 32 percent, but with a wide range, especially on the upside because it might not happen and some French voters are extremely pro-right. So, lets start with 39.25 rounded to 39 percent.  The 7 percent mid-point for the effects of a scandal is probably the absolute bottom right now. This is a question that could need a lot more updating than usual because of the abrupt EU scandal.

If a good proportion Melonchon communist vote goes to her rather than Macron which would be more logical, it will be very close. \n2) How LePen performs in the debates. She was terrible last time and had no idea how to deal with Macron.  And as Macron was an unknown quantity then with no history it was hard to attack him.  This time she has ammunition and will have learnt from last time and no doubt will have prepared carefully.  She has to do well there.\n3) Familiarity.
