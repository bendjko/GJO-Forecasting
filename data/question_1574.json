Remaining at BBB 2 notches above HY. Changing it in the next six weeks would look extremely bad, absent any unpredictable events (i.e. government fails) etc.  There is only one rating issuance scheduled until 4th of July by Moody's (8th of May):\n- Moody's is already at Baa3 so one above junk, with stable outlook -> it is one notch lower as the other two, meaning they would need to justify another step very strongly.\n- The political situation would get extremely tense if they deviated from other agencies so strongly, as many pension and mutual funds would be forced to sell Italy if they were to downgrade it to HY. From the large Asset Managers that I know, HY is defined as being rated below BBB- by at least 1 rating agency. So this one rating would be enough. Also the ECB accepting fallen angels would not change this. The ECB case is mostly relevant for banks. \n- Given this situation all rating agencies argue that the long term path of the deficit is deciding in conjunction with economic development in Q3 and refinancing rates. Smart move: This gives them room to downgrade Italy if they do not do their homework in the next 6 - 12 months, or if the economy does not recover or if the ECB fails to act.\n- 2 of those three parameters are medium term focused so we do not have to predict that. \n- Per FT article, the ECB is expected to increase its PEPP program this week, further strengthening the backstop. ECB's Isabel Schnabel recently explained on Twitter that any increasing financing conditions for individual countries will impair their transmission mechanism and is therefore not acceptable. The ECB has Italy's back then. \n- Moody's expects, that about 60% of Italy's refinancing needs this year could be covered by EU institutions (incl. ESM, and SURE the unemployment reinsurance). \n- Moody's said last week that despite pandemics temporary nature and the remaining low refinancing costs (2.15% 10y yield at the time) would mean that creditworthiness should be unchanged. Likelihood is therefore low but not impossible (probability = 5%)\nSource for Moody's points: https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1224706 (Research is free after registration) Other risk: Fitch to issue exceptional rating: Fitch will issue their rating at 10th of July so after the deadline for our bet. But exceptional rating downgrade is not impossible. However, why would they issue their rating 8 weeks or later in advance? Something truly exceptional would have to happen (probability = 1%)\nWhy even lower than before? I stumbled across an ESMA rule that says that if rating agencies publish outside their communicated schedules, they have to publish an explanation of why they did that. I assume the looks of doing so would also unsettle markets, which might push markets into a bad equilibrium as seen in the euro crisis, so deviating would be a massive cost.  Risks to this assessment: \n- GDP and unemployment figures are expected to be horrible (-5.4% QoQ), but there is massive uncertainty around that. Figures will come out on 30th of April and those will be reflected in the forecast as will be the PMI numbers, all of which you find here: https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/calendar#\n"], [81559, "2020-04-27T10:06:15Z", [0.05], ""], [78239, "2020-04-27T07:11:13Z", [0.03], "Updating further to lower probability.

So S&P and Moody's seem to be the more relevant agencies. Moody's rating is one notch away from junk already. Given that a downgrade to below investment grade would likely imply that most non-domestic investors become forced sellers overnight and the resulting impact on the Italian government bond market would be devastating while already being the most conservative rating agency I would consider the likelyhood of a downgrade as low by Moody's. This leaves it mostly to S&P. I see the following arguments for a downgrade:\n- Italy's budget deficit is increasing, economcy will most likely contract substantially in 2020\n- concerns about Italy's financial position have increased over recent years and last rating change by S&P is already 2.5 years back\n- moving to BBB- would likely not increase pressure on Italy too much as still investment rating and just confirm Moody's stance\n- UK's debt downgrade by Fitch to AA- on 28 March shows that rating agencies are taking into account the Coronavirus impact aleady (https://www.ft.com/content/28fbd0d1-c5be-4a8b-8c63-b14c746ee8bc) Against downgrade:\n- Affirmation of France rating at AA by S&P on 04 April, outlook remains stable (https://in.reuters.com/article/brief-sp-says-france-aa-a-1-ratings-affi/brief-sp-says-france-aa-a-1-ratings-affirmed-outlook-stable-idINFWN2BR1BO) despite France's growing budget deficit (4.3% of GDP) and expected economic contraction of 1.7% for 2020; this is an example how a (currently assumed as) temporary slowdown usually does not affect ratings\n- this is underlined by a BIS study (https://www.bis.org/publ/work207.pdf): \"Rating decisions are typically not influenced by events whose impact on credit quality is expected to be temporary, such as a slowdown in economic growth\" and \"In  a  random  sample  of  30  downgrades  over  the  2001-04  period,  we  find  that  only  10%  make  reference  to  new  developments;  the  remainder  relate  to  longer-term  financial  trends  or  previously  released  information\"\n- similar statement by S&P for Italy (https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-ratings-sp/sp-global-no-immediate-need-to-adjust-italys-ratings-idUSL8N2BN5GT), \u201cWe don\u2019t think there is an immediate need to adjust the credit ratings,\u201d said Gill. \u201cWe have long-term concerns.. but they were there before.\u201d\n- UK downgrade was only party driven by Corona impacts, Fitch mentions concerns about loosening fiscal stance and obviously Brexit uncertainty\n- ECB has moved back close to a \"whatever it takes\" stance in the recent crisis and has committed to fight against any fragmentation between countries that would affect the monetary transmission mechanism in the Eurozone; ie they buy BTPS and therefore keep Italy's refinancing costs low; Italy currently does not face any issues re-financing\n"], [36666, "2020-04-04T09:58:19Z", [1.0], ""], [85678, "2020-04-04T08:34:23Z", [0.17], ""], [86946, "2020-04-04T03:12:26Z", [0.57], ""], [1639, "2020-04-03T15:43:44Z", [0.15], "A few considerations: 1.  Italian Stocks Rebound on Euro Bonds Hopes\nThe FTSE MIB rose 289 points, or 1.8% to 16,834 on Thursday, recovering from a 3% fall in the previous session, on hopes the European Union will soon launch effective measures, particularly euro bonds, to contain the economic coronavirus consequences. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said that Italy is not asking the Dutch citizens to pay for Italian debt, but asking for a euro from Dutch taxpayers. He added Europe must act in a solidarity-based and effective way because it is unthinkable that some people may benefit from this crisis. A jump in oil prices amid hopes of a global supply cut supported sentiment. 2.  Emission of Euro Bonds\nThe idea is to spread the risk among the 17 member states of the euro area so as to lower the yields of the peripheral countries. The proposal provides for the creation of a European debt agency to coordinate issues. Before reaching a real unification of the debts, a more limited version of the Eurobonds is the so-called redemption fund (Erf), a debt redemption fund that plans to pool only the portion of national public debt that exceeds 60 % in relation to GDP. In this way, all Eurozone member countries would find themselves with a debt equal to or less than 60% of GDP, with the adoption of national laws designed to prevent the threshold from being exceeded again. 3.  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has launched a fund of \u20ac 100 billion for loans to states covered by 25 billion of voluntary guarantees from states to the EU budget. The tool renamed Sure (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency), will be used to finance national integration funds or similar schemes for job protection. 4.

The current ratings from the 3 credit rating agencies for Italy are as follows:\nS&P: BBB (negative outlook) \nMoody's: Baa3 (stable outlook)\nFitch: BBB (negative outlook)\nSo S&P and Fitch both rate Italy two notches above sub-investment grade (or junk) with a negative outlook, while Moody's have them a notch lower. The risk of a downgrade therefore seems much more likely to come from S&P and Fitch. S&P will review their rating on Italy on April 24th, Moody's will do so on 8th May and Fitch on July 10th. While rating changes do occur outside these windows, it is rare. Therefore we should focus on S&P. If we go back to the 26th April 2019 rating action (available on S&P's website), where the BBB rating was reaffirmed, S&P gave 3 reasons that would potentially lead to them downgrading Italy:\n\"1. General government deficits and net government debt as a percentage of GDP significantly exceed our forecasts; or\n2. We observe a marked deterioration in external financial conditions for Italy's government and its banks; or\n3. Policy changes permanently weaken Italy's potential growth.\" Both the deficit and debt/gdp have increased significantly due to the government response to COVID-19 (https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-ratings-scope/update-1-italys-debt-to-gdp-could-easily-top-145-scope-ratings-idUSL8N2BJ8MH). The question is whether this is a temporary step-up or the start of a trend. If only temporary, is it enough for the CRA's to downgrade them? 2. Italian bond yields have remained under control due to the ECB's \u20ac750bn pandemic emergency purchase program (https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/italy-10-year-bond-yield). This should prevent external financing conditions from deteriorating. 3. There have been few meaningful long-term policy changes so not overly worried about this. Probably more importantly, a S&P bigwig recently said that Italy's sovereign credit rating would only be hit if the coronavirus hits LONG-TERM growth (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-ratings-s-p/sp-global-risk-to-italy-rating-only-if-coronavirus-hits-long-term-growth-idUSKBN20X213). To me this says they are not imminently planning a downgrade. So to summarise:\nS&P may have reason to downgrade Italy given the increase in the deficit and debt/gdp ratio, but comments from them suggest they the current situation may only be a temporary hit and not enough to warrant a downgrade (I may be reading too much into this). I give them a 25% chance of downgrading Italy before 4th July.\nMoody's are very unlikely to downgrade Italy to junk, especially without moving to a negative outlook first. <1% chance of a downgrade before 4th July.\nFitch are in a similar bucket to S&P, but they are not scheduled to review Italy until July 10th (maybe an error in the way the question is phrased??). Therefore I only give them a 5% chance of downgrading Italy before 4th July.
