Here are some reasons why. Key facts:\n\u2022\tThere was high level tit-for-tat war of words between the leadership of US and Iran in late June/early July.\n\u2022\tUS decided not to respond with military action when Iran shot down it\u2019s drone on 20th of June.\n\u2022\tUS Senat did not pass the bill which would have blocked funding for military action against Iran without congressional authorization.\n\u2022\tIranian Intelligence minister has stated US and Iran could enter into talks if US lifts its sanctions and ayatollah Khameini allows such talks.\n\u2022\tUS has requested an emergency IAEA meeting to discuss Iranian nuclear issue. Key assumptions:\n\u2022\tMilitary confrontation between the two sides most likely to happen on the maritime or air domain. Ground troops of the two states not operating in close proximity \u2013 except possibly in Syria where both likely have SF units.\n\u2022\tWhile President Trump decided against retaliatory military strikes against Iran for the shooting down of the US drone, in a next similar situation I assume US would likely respond using military means. A non-military response would make US and the Trump administration look weak, something Trump does not want to appear as, especially before the election cycle. Question remains what type of Iranian action could trigger such a response (see below)?\n\u2022\tBoth sides likely do not want a \u201chot\u201d conflict:\no\tTrump administration likely understands that a conflict with Iran would be likely costly both politically and economically. Likely there to be no desire to risk such an \u201cadventure\u201d before the election cycle begins. This could change if Trump sees he might be losing to the Democratic candidate, reasoning that a show of force might boost his ratings.\no\tIranian leadership highly likely knows that a military conflict with US would have dire consequences to Iran and it\u2019s society/population. Potentially even putting the survival of the regime in risk.\n\u2022\tIn case of an attack from the Iranian side, it will likely use asymmetric tactics in order to maintain highest level of plausible deniability.\no\tLikely targets US maritime assets in Persian Gulf/Straits of Hormuz, US aviation assets in or near Iranian airspace, US diplomatic offices or regional military bases with US military personnel present. I have identified three potential scenarios in which this question might resolve in a \u201cYes\u201d answer:\n1.\tScenario 1 \u2013 US decides to launch a retaliatory attack against Iran to pressure the Iranian regime to make concessions on the Iranian nuclear agreement and/or pay back for Iranian military/proxy force (Hezbollah, Shia militias in Iraq) actions against US and allied assets (US drone, tankers, embassies). Use of out-of theatre assets/regional assets (naval and air) as well as remote weaponry (SSM/SAM/cruise missiles).\n2.\tScenario 2 \u2013 Iranian higher leadership gives orders to carry out covert action against US forces. Confrontation to take place over Iranian airspace or at the sea, alternatively against US interests globally (embassies, business interests) or against US close allies. Iranian higher leadership holds the view that US will likely abstain from retaliatory action or will carry out a limited military strike that could benefit Iranian regime internally increasing support to it from the general population.\n3.\tScenario 3 \u2013 rouge elements of the Iranian security forces without the knowledge of the Iranian higher leadership decide to launch an attack against US. Using asymmetric tactics small units commanded by these rouge commanders attack US forces at sea. Key question to be answered:\n\u2022\tWhat kind of Iranian action and against who would trigger a military response by US? Would US launch a military strike only when it is attacked or would it retaliate against Iran in a case where one of it\u2019s allies is attacked (Israel, Saudi Arabia).

Iran is far more useful as a bludgeon that Trump can use against the Obama legacy (a key priority) and actual war would be too much of a commitment. Something like the US stance against the Soviet union in the 1980s for example. I also think that Trump still believes that Iran will come to the table for talks (he likes the photos with leaders i.e. North Korea). However, a confrontaiton in which one person died (even by accident) is certainly in the 30-40 PERCENT RANGE currently. After the last-minute call-off of the Iran strikes, its my understanding that any confrontation would be accidental, hence the relatively low 35 percent (which I consider a pretty high chance). Iran is far more useful as a bludgeon that Trump can use against the Obama legacy and red meat for the more 'MuricaMiltaryRules (C) inclined wing of his party (as well as the MEK-sympathizing folks).

And the Guard declined any attempt to retaliate against Israel after it repeatedly attacked Guard operations inside Syria, analysts said. That posture changed in the past few months when the Trump administration designated the Guard as a terrorist group and added sanctions to block Iran\u2019s oil sales, a critical revenue source for the country.\n. . . \nThe United States has also accused Iran of planting naval mines that damaged six tankers in two incidents in the waters around the Persian Gulf, and Western officials say those attacks were carried out by the Revolutionary Guards \u2014 although Iranian leaders have disclaimed responsibility. The United States Cyber Command on Thursday conducted online attacks against an Iranian intelligence group that American officials believe helped plan the attacks against oil tankers, according to people briefed on the operation.\n. . . \n\u201cAmerican officials like Mssrs. Hook and Cotton are underestimating Iran\u2019s military capabilities,\u201d said Foad Izadi, a conservative professor at Tehran University and a commentator for Guard publications. \u201cThis is an impression that Iranian leaders wanted to correct. Iran needed to send this message to the other side that attacking us would be extremely costly.\u201d Perhaps because of the mild response to the hacking of the surveillance drone in 2011, many of the Guard officials who gathered in celebration on Thursday expressed surprise at the level of American outrage over the takedown of another one, according to the person who attended the dinner.\n. . . \nThroughout the day and through the celebration, this person said, Guard officials nervously checked their mobile devices for news from Washington and signs that a military attack might be coming. Iranian officials soon began to say publicly that they had consciously hit only an unmanned drone but had refrained from attacking an American spy plane nearby in part because it carried 35 crew members. \u201cWe could have hit that plane,\u201d Gen. Abulfazl Hajizadeh of the Guard\u2019s air force said, according to Iranian state media. \u201cIt was our right but we struck the drone with no passengers.\u201d American officials said the spy plane was outside Iranian air space and could not hold so large a crew. Western analysts said they doubted claims that Guard leaders had failed to anticipate the severity of the American reaction to shooting down the drone, noting the caustic warnings recently issued by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, and Mr. Trump himself. \u201cTo say that they were surprised is just inaccurate,\u201d Mr. Vaez of the International Crisis Group said. Some current and former American military officials, though, said they had also concluded that the Guard did not foresee the backlash. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake\u201d or \u201csome rogue guy just pushing a button,\u201d said retired Vice Admiral John W. Miller, a former commander of the American Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. \u201cIt was a complex accomplishment by Iran that was well planned,\u201d he said, but \u201ca miscalculation.\u201d Still, at the celebratory dinner Thursday night, exultant Guard leaders bragged that they had done it with an Iranian-made missile instead of one acquired from the Russians or Chinese, according to the person present. That claim that could not be independently confirmed, but it was repeated Saturday in the Iranian state media. \u201cBolton and Hook keep whispering in Trump\u2019s ears that Iran is all show-off and if you attack it, the regime will fold like puff pastry,\u201d the host of the event, Col.
