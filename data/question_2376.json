Compounding the buzz are ecstatic reviews from critics and industry screenings over the past month as the film holds an incredible 97 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from 189 critics. Thursday and true weekend sales look strong. The holiday itself will inflate Sunday, and the film\u2019s strong draw for a premium screen experience means average ticket prices are soaring. Buzz across the social media sphere is incredibly positive, although the X factor remains in how well a sequel to a 36-year-old film will immediately draw in younger audiences. Paramount is notably releasing Maverick as the widest theatrical launch in history at 4,732 locations this weekend, besting the prior opening weekend record of 4,725 by 2019\u2019s The Lion King remake.

Of course star power plays a big part and it was the biggest premiere of the festival, adding the hype of an almost fully normal Cannes.\u00a0 There's a good piece in the WSJ today that makes some good points as to why this film is such a big bet/risk: It's been 36 years since the original movie came out.

But the box office overall is still 40% below pre pandemic level. The movies that have performed the best in the past two years have come from \"established franchises in the superhero genre\" This means \"uncertainty for a movie with a prequel from the cold war era\" The audience that saw the first movie is almost 50 now and that's a demographic that has not yet returned to theatres. So expectations are not as high as they were for the first movie, which was the top grossing film the year it came out (1986).\u00a0 BoxOffice Pro projects that Maverick will make between $280-$395 million total domestically and the plans for the studio are to run it longer than the actual 45 days that movies stay in theatres before moving to streaming now.\u00a0 This may mean that they are not so sure about a huge opening week but that rely more on the movie increasing its audience.\u00a0 Maverick will have to prove that it appeals to a younger audience beyond the 45-50 crowd. \"More than half of people over 45 yrs old have not been to a movie theatre in the past year, compared to 20% between 18-24.\"  That said, the movie is picking a great weekend to open in the US and there are no other big films opening that weekend that could compete with Paramount's marketing.

His main success was from the Mission Impossible series, a well-known detective series. Top Gun: Maverick (2022) has a budget of 152 million, and with a star actor like Tom Cruise playing a lead role along with actor Val Kilmer, this movie is on the road to success making it past 45 million. Movies\u2019 box office is unlikely to fail below their budget and often have great success in the amount returned. Additionally, with the trailer receiving 21 million views and the average movie ticket price being $9.57, according to Statista, if everyone who watched the trailer were to watch the film, there would be an estimated $200,970,000 dollars, roughly 50 million dollars more than it\u2019s original budget. The film also lands on Memorial Day Weekend, making it a very patriotic and great film to watch as it is perfect for the time being. Top Gun: Maverick (2022) is a sequel to the original Top Gun movie which was released in 1986, having a budget of 15 million and receiving 357 million dollars in return. Although pushed back multiple times in 2021 due to the Coronavirus pandemic, with cinematography like this, intense shots, and Tom Cruise, Top Gun: Maverick (2022) is well on the right path to breaking the 45 million dollar box office goal, especially with all the hype and anticipation behind it.  My base probability is 35 because based on the information known in the \u201cTop 10 movies 2021\u201d, and with the average of 39.5 million on the \u201cLast 10 years of Tom Cruise\u201d, I made the conclusion that on average, . Although, after doing further research on \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d, I had to consider many factors like the demographic that the movie is appealing to and how the movie has been postponed a lot and the anticipation in the comments under the trailer, it led me to change my answer to a higher probability because it seems a lot of people are excited for the movie, which would increase the box office gross in the opening weekend of the movie.  Not sure if we are talking adjusted dollars when comparing, but based on the timing of the movie, with the war in Ukraine, no real competition at the box office, and star power I think it will break through the 45 million threshold. the trailer has been viewed millions of times, and the comments regarding the film are very strong. Reviews are positive as well!

Top Gun was the most famous movie of its time, in the genre of course, and reboots and late sequels have been highly sought after in past years. The projected figures of the movie have been seen as anything from $95 million to $130 million, but nowhere near $45 million. Covid would have been a factor, however Spider-man: No Way Home, made $260 million proving that the pandemic is a much smaller factor now than it has been in past years. The ad budget for the movie is over $140 million and they have spent $150 million on production of the movie. On top of that, every scene in a jet was shot in the cockpit of an actual F/A-18 Super Hornet, something that has never been done. Tom Cruise is a huge name in Hollywood and he is complimented by actors such as Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer, Miles Teller, Ed Harris, and Glen Powell. With an all star cast, a massive budget on both production and advertising, an abundance of hype and nostalgia, and a great potential for a plot, Top Gun Maverick is destined for much more than $45 million.\u00a0"], [106324, "2022-05-05T18:20:28Z", [0.92], ""], [691, "2022-05-05T14:06:18Z", [1.0], ""], [105338, "2022-05-05T10:39:54Z", [1.0], "The movie is highly anticipated, early reviews are great, and it has no real competition on release (Dr. Strange releases 3 weeks earlier).
