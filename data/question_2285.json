Uncanny. Global wheat supply continues to be under threat from Russia's war in Ukraine and the USDA predicts lower production for 2022 and 2023.\u00a0 Price went up by as much as 5.2% on Monday \"against a backdrop of poor harvest forecasts and an India-Egypt trade deal\". Chicago wheat futures were up 5.1% to $10.93 per bushel from their previous close of $10.45. (Price today was at $1,077 right on the edge).\u00a0 Russia's Lavrov met with Turkey's Erdogan yesterday to discuss access to Black Sea ports and suddenly wheat prices dropped (about .16%) Both countries voiced support following their meeting \"for a safe corridor in the Black Sea to allow Ukrainian grain exports, but Kyiv rejected the proposal, saying it was not credible.\" AP \"Russia also demanded Ukraine remove mines from the Black Sea, and both Moscow and Ankara said the West should ease sanctions on Moscow to allow the export of Russian grains amid an escalating world food crisis. While food exports are technically exempt from the sanctions, Russia claims that restrictions on its ships and banks make it impossible to deliver its grain to global markets.\"\u00a0 Turkey knows too well that the next front of the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be over the Black Sea (access to ports, escorting ships transporting grain) so it should not come as a surprise that Erdogan went on a Twitter rant today threatening Greece. As part of the rant, Erdogan said that \"Turkey will not relinquish its rights in the Aegean and will not refrain from using the powers granted to it by international agreements for the armament of the islands when necessary\" and went on as far as saying \"Including demilitarized islands in various exercises and seeking to use NATO and third party countries as a tool in this unlawfulness is nothing but an effort that will have a tragic ending.\" It looks like Turkey is playing its cards and using their power over the Black Sea situation as a bargaining chip to address pending issues and grievances. If this is the case, then both Russia and now Turkey are most likely to continue to weaponize food supply to get advantage at war (as per the EU).\u00a0\u00a0 We may see prices move slightly but just enough to go slightly below or above $1,075. Since wheat prices are expected to continue to go up given the unresolved situation, I'll go with the slightly higher side above 1,075 and see what happens in the next 6 days.\u00a0 https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-turkey-middle-east-sergey-lavrov-6f0447bfa71448f2c4b8f78a7414ce45 \n \n"], [99943, "2022-06-10T00:33:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.51, 0.49, 0.0], "I think there might be a slightly downward trend, but this question could end up on either side of 1075."], [67312, "2022-06-09T22:48:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.49, 0.01], ""], [86785, "2022-06-09T22:10:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.49, 0.49, 0.02], ""], [86785, "2022-06-09T22:10:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.46, 0.45, 0.08], ""], [1333, "2022-06-09T18:37:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.88, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-06-09T18:34:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.82, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2022-06-09T18:34:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.46, 0.54, 0.0], ""], [99993, "2022-06-09T16:59:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.41, 0.56, 0.02], ""], [1333, "2022-06-09T15:59:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.19, 0.81, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-06-09T15:58:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.81, 0.09], ""], [40636, "2022-06-09T14:58:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2022-06-09T14:24:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44, 0.56, 0.0], ""], [87897, "2022-06-09T14:11:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.53, 0.43, 0.02], ""], [105209, "2022-06-09T12:27:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [95992, "2022-06-09T11:41:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.48, 0.47, 0.03], ""], [94737, "2022-06-09T11:26:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [104344, "2022-06-09T11:22:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.11, 0.64, 0.19], "Sorry just amending my forecast as oil prices are in fact still high.

I can't picture prices falling below 1000 by June 15 at this point, though, even with volatility, and I think there's a bit more risk of the last bin than I thought before. (I follow July '22 CBOT wheat because the source data are W.1 CBOT wheat, which is front month wheat, i.e., the closest futures contract for CBOT wheat that can be purchased, and I think this question will be resolved using July '22 CBOT wheat data. If I'm wrong, then it'll be resolved using Sep '22 CBOT wheat data, which is very similar anyway.)https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZWN22/overview"], [1333, "2022-05-12T09:01:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.3, 0.39, 0.3], ""], [105209, "2022-05-12T03:27:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [97892, "2022-05-11T23:49:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [94737, "2022-05-11T16:51:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [87691, "2022-05-11T06:09:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [103902, "2022-05-11T04:23:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.28, 0.65], ""], [94872, "2022-05-11T02:43:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.29, 0.46, 0.22], ""], [97892, "2022-05-11T01:32:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.51, 0.47, 0.01], ""], [87897, "2022-05-10T16:37:52Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.07, 0.36, 0.39, 0.17], ""], [103878, "2022-05-10T10:00:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.36, 0.43, 0.17], ""], [86554, "2022-05-10T06:54:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.3, 0.48, 0.2], ""], [105570, "2022-05-10T05:34:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.6, 0.28, 0.09], ""], [1333, "2022-05-10T01:07:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.22, 0.39, 0.38], ""], [105209, "2022-05-09T23:48:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.13, 0.57, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [97892, "2022-05-09T23:18:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.46, 0.4, 0.06], ""], [14027, "2022-05-09T18:29:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.31, 0.53, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2022-05-09T10:32:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.21, 0.39, 0.39], ""], [37893, "2022-05-09T07:03:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.37, 0.34, 0.18], ""], [94872, "2022-05-09T06:29:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.23, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [105622, "2022-05-09T04:16:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [95992, "2022-05-09T02:16:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.33, 0.38, 0.19], ""], [1333, "2022-05-09T00:18:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.22, 0.38, 0.39], ""], [97892, "2022-05-07T16:13:27Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.11, 0.44, 0.37, 0.07], ""], [1333, "2022-05-07T13:48:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.21, 0.38, 0.39], ""], [691, "2022-05-07T13:37:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.49, 0.11], ""], [96757, "2022-05-07T03:54:32Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.33, 0.37, 0.15], ""], [96757, "2022-05-07T03:52:26Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.13, 0.3, 0.35, 0.16], ""], [67312, "2022-05-07T03:42:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.3, 0.38, 0.24], ""], [105312, "2022-05-07T02:15:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.17], ""], [14027, "2022-05-07T01:41:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.37, 0.47, 0.15], ""], [104714, "2022-05-06T23:19:09Z", [0.01, 0.03, 0.29, 0.32, 0.29, 0.06], ""], [97185, "2022-05-06T20:03:31Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.47, 0.48, 0.01], ""], [103258, "2022-05-06T19:39:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.41, 0.46, 0.08], ""], [99943, "2022-05-06T16:54:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.43, 0.43, 0.09], ""], [99993, "2022-05-06T16:08:51Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.3, 0.41, 0.21], ""], [1333, "2022-05-06T16:03:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.11, 0.49, 0.39], ""], [100653, "2022-05-06T15:44:44Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.22, 0.23, 0.44], ""], [86554, "2022-05-06T14:26:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.37, 0.43, 0.18], ""], [97892, "2022-05-06T01:04:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.51, 0.39, 0.03], ""], [1333, "2022-05-05T21:59:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.08, 0.41, 0.5], ""], [99943, "2022-05-05T18:58:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.4, 0.4, 0.02], ""], [37893, "2022-05-05T06:40:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.37, 0.34, 0.18], ""], [94872, "2022-05-05T05:27:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.37, 0.4, 0.17], ""], [94872, "2022-05-05T05:26:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.38, 0.4, 0.15], ""], [691, "2022-05-04T16:32:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2022-05-04T14:25:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.09, 0.4, 0.5], ""], [1333, "2022-05-04T13:34:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.07, 0.4, 0.52], ""], [86554, "2022-05-04T07:26:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.37, 0.43, 0.15], ""], [97892, "2022-05-04T01:24:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.59, 0.41, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2022-05-03T21:29:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.41, 0.43, 0.13], ""], [99943, "2022-05-03T15:51:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.38, 0.02], "Looking again, if prices continue to drift down, bin 3 would be possible."], [99943, "2022-05-03T15:48:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.43, 0.02], "The price range is looking pretty stable.

The highest it has been since 2008. The root cause of this recent spike  appears to be conflict in Ukraine and Russia (Accounting for ~30% of global wheat exports) with the ongoing conflict shutting down commercial ports in both Ukraine and Russia along the Black Sea. This does not appear to be changing any time soon, the conflict is still developing in the early stages with the region along the Black sea being the most likely to continue being involved in conflict. To add to this droughts in parts of the US, Canada, and South America appear likely to put even further downward pressure on supply for wheat and maize.
