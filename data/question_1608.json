I'm a little worried that I'm over-revving on this, but my longterm weighted averages are heavily skewed toward my prior views, so a few days at the above allocations won't hurt too much if the above scenario doesn't come to pass. However, there is also a scenario where the above does not come to pass, but movie theaters don't think there will be enough traffic for it to be worth opening.
