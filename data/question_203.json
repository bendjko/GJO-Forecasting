The company initially worked to develop batteries and electric drivetrains, filing more than 100 patents and delivering battery packs for electric buses in China. That all changed in 2014, when two Chinese firms invested around $100 million for a nearly 50% stake in the firm. One was BAIC, a Chinese state-owned carmaker, the other LeEco (then called LeTV), a technology company making televisions, smartphones, and electric bikes. Atieva went on a hiring spree and pivoted to developing a complete, autonomous electric car to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Teslas.\u201d It should be noted here that LeEco has its own electric car concept, has raised $1 billion, and is seemingly backed in large part by the same billionaire backing Faraday Future. . . .  \u201cVehicle development progressed well through 2015, according to former executives, but there was growing friction among investors. Jia Yueting, the billionaire owner of LeEco, had quietly started his own electric vehicle startup, Faraday Future, in 2014, without informing the Atieva board. Then LeEco announced its own plans to develop a luxury, connected EV called the LeSEE. Meanwhile, BAIC was attempting to get access to Atieva\u2019s battery and drivetrain technology, and wanted to shift the company to focus on Chinese buyers. In November 2015, co-founder Bernard Tse was abruptly ousted as CEO. Then in early 2016, according to former executives, BAIC sold its stake in the company. According to several sources close to Atieva, the buyer of BAIC\u2019s shares was Jia Yueting.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This question doesn't specify that the vehicle must be a \"production vehicle\", therefore, I think any vehicle that is openly sold would qualify."], [38, "2016-10-14T22:01:09Z", [1.0], "How can you sell something without taking orders first?\nI'm wondering how GJO defines \"high-end\":  by price?

At this point, their website looks like they're recruiting staff rather than selling a car (IMHO).  NextEV hopes to start production this year - but they sound like a component manufacturer.  References are to a plant manufacturing motors and electronics modules - not sure where the electric vehicle with super car performance comes from but it would need to be built somewhere too.

I bet all three companies will ask for reservations which will cost people a grand or two but there won't be an actual sales order because they won't know how much one will cost until they hire the people to design and build these things.

I doubt that any of the companies could get orders without actual product, though, (even Tesla already had history when they did presales), even if only preliminary models, and if FF doesn't have a plant, that would be difficult if not impossible this year.
