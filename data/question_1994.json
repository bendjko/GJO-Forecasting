Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested rates may have to increase to combat inflation, but quickly walked that back hours later (https://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-says-interest-rates-may-have-to-rise-to-keep-economy-from-overheating-11620151101?mod=hp_lead_pos1). It seems that monetary and fiscal policy leaders are hesitant to acknowledge the threat of inflation. (Trying not to spook markets?)  Summary: \nRates tend to increase when inflation does, however, Jerome Powell and other policy leaders seem hesitant to raise rates claiming any inflation we experience in the short term will pass. I see very low odds of rates (hence 2% estimate). There is a real possibility given the amount of stimulus and pent up cash that the economy could begin running a little hot (35% chance rates increase). However, given Powell's hesitancy to raise rates and Yellen walking back her statement I see a strong possibility for no change (I take what they are saying at face value)... 63% chance same.

Only they haven't clearly disclosed what the bassline period is, include spring 2020 and current inflation in undershooting, start in august 2020 and inflation is on target. (1)  This creates some ambiguity whether rates will be increased or not. Fiscal stimulus is still going on and congress is discussing more in the form of  an infrastructure bill (2). Raising interests rates while the government is pumping money into the economy seems counter intuitive.  Fed policy has changes in the years before 2020 and became more focused on low income Americans who enjoy most benefits from loose monetary policy.  This change in course is likely to stay also looking at the negative impact COVID had on low income jobs.  Given above I think rates will stay the same but more Fed guidance on which inflation baseline they're following can still change this.  1:\nhttps://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/04/17/the-fed-should-explain-how-it-will-respond-to-rising-inflation\n2:\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/"], [1333, "2021-05-04T14:45:15Z", [0.08, 0.83, 0.09], ""], [81187, "2021-05-04T13:37:37Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [85535, "2021-05-04T03:18:05Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [86367, "2021-05-03T23:43:43Z", [0.0, 0.88, 0.12], ""], [2895, "2021-05-03T22:25:36Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05], "Fed funds rate has devolved importance to only slightly above symbolic in consequence, especially vs reserve management (including rates on excess reserves) , QE, and open market operations.
