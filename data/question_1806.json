Possible bins: \"On or before June 15,\" \"June 16 through July 15,\" \"July 16 through August 15,\" and \"After August 15.\" The average Rt for the 50 states + DC has fallen to 0.94.  In mid-November 2020 there was a fairly strong correlation (~-0.6) between cumulative per capita infections and the Rt for each state.  Higher cumulative infections correlated to lower reinfection rates.  The speculation was that it was mostly due to behavior, but also possibly to partial herd immunity due to infection.  The magnitude of the January surge settled any questions regarding the cause:  it was due to behavior.  And of course the highly transmissible variant emerged before the vaccine could protect the population.  In any case the correlation completely dissipated by mid-February. Over the past week another strong correlation (-0.6) has emerged, this time between the vaccination rate (1+ dose) and the reinfection rate, Rt, as reported by https://covidactnow.org/.  Vaccinations are clearly having an impact.  The problem, for purposes of this question, is that there isn't sufficient time for states with low vaccination rates to push reinfection rates down.  The five states with the highest vaccination rates are: NH (59.8%), MA (54.7%), CT (53.9%), VT (53.8%), and ME (53.5%).  There are nine states over 50%. The five states with the lowest vaccination rates are: MS (30.7%), AL (32.0%), LA (32.1%), ID (33.6%), and WY (33.6%).  There are seven states below 35%.  With the lagging states having only a little over half the vaccination rates as the highest states it looks like we will see very uneven progress during the month of May.  Some states will have rapidly falling new infection numbers, but some will still have high numbers of new infections.  Progress will be significant, but it will be patchy.

From CDC data [See https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations], 68.8% of the 65+ demographic has now been vaccinated.  Nearly 80% of first shots are now going to people 18 to 64, and the number of total shots given is also increasing.  So from this point on we will be vaccinating the people most likely to spread COVID, whereas previously we vaccinated those most likely to die of COVID. If we track the changes in the CDC data we can see what percentage of the 18-64 demographic is being vaccinated daily.  It's about 0.75%, and this could be expected to increase.  But for a conservative estimate I'll assume it remains constant.  As of today, March 21, just over 20% of the 18-64 age group has received at least one shot.  Linearly projecting this forward gives the following:     Date --------------- Pct 18-64 Vaccinated March 21    ---------------      20%\nMarch 31    ---------------      27.5%\nApril 30       ---------------        50%\nMay 31        ---------------        72.5% Forgive the formatting; tabs are not allowed. Vaccine hesitancy will at some point reduce the numbers, and the curve will flatten.  But even if we can only get to 50 or 60%, retransmission should be greatly reduced.  One additional point:  The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for people 16 and older, so this could add an important group (high school students) to the vaccinated population.

The average reinfection rate for the 50 states + DC has increased to 0.983.  Rt will have to fall well below 0.90 for new infections to decrease by the 2.3%/day required to reach 50k/wk by June 15.  It's still iffy.  But at some point fairly soon I expect to see the rate of new infections begin to fall as more people are removed from the path of the fast-spreading B.1.1.7 mutation. So I'm increasing the chances (again), from 11% to 23%.  If Rt does not drop significantly by early April I'll join the crowd (again).

We can safely assume that not all cases were confirmed so there should be around 10-25% immunity based on past infections [3].\nThere are currently 27 doses/100 inhabitants with 17.6 vaccinated/100 inhabitants and a rate of an additional 0.65/100 inhabitants per day [1]. And that rate has (at least approximately) risen by 0.01/day since the beginning of the year [1]. With 14 weeks (98 days) to go this should bring the US to at least: \n  27 + 0.65*98 = 90.7 vaccinations/100 and \n  17.6 + 0.33*98 = 49 vaccinated/100    [*]\nassuming statistical independence this gives something like 60% immunity [4], compared to the 25% of now this would reduce the available population by roughly a factor of 2, which would leave a factor of 4 before the question resolves positive.  Now this is a close-to-worst-case assumption. We did not take into account:\n- increasing vaccination rate (even if only linearly growing)\n- increased cumulative number of infections (even if this is dropping)\n- better weather conditions due to the beginning of the summer We can estimate the former two rather easily. Which ends up increasing the average number of daily vaccinations from 0.65 to 1.14 (and the number of vaccinated from 0.33 to 0.57) [5]. This then increases the number of vaccinations per 100 from 90.7 to 138.7 and the number of vaccinated people from 49 to 73.4. Now these are optimistic since I would assume that at 75% completion you start running into problems of a) getting the unwilling to be vaccinated and b) reduced rate since some areas will be done  (and thus drop out of the vaccination resources). But I would assume some positive correlation between \"people not willing to get vaccinated\" and \"people already infected\" so that I would assume something on the order of 80% immunity, which in turn corresponds to a reduction of available host population of a factor of 4 (wrt. to the situation now) leaving a factor of 2 that needs to come from the weather/other effects. Counterpoints:\n- immune escape due to mutations\n- loss of immunity over time\n- lack of vaccinations\n- increased testing due to freed up resources Of these I really only think the first is a significant unknown. We simply don't know yet how SARS-CoV2 mutates under pressure, but everything we have seen so far is still covered by the major vaccines (or at least claimed to) and only the South African and Brazilian variants seem to have escaped the natural immunity [6]. But even then they lead to significantly reduced symptoms so we might not (have to) care at all. There is no sign of a significant wane of immunity over time (reinfection rates are a few percent) and I don't think we screw up the vaccination production this late into the game. \nThe wildcard is the testing, in particular the willingness. I think we will have the situation enough under control to guarantee that the clinic systems will not be overwhelmed again at which point I would assume that the pressure to test will invert and everyone \"in charge\" will prefer not to test in order to reduce the numbers further.

I got the vaccination numbers and total case count numbers from https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\nI got the total population numbers by state from https://covidactnow.org Two big assumptions on this one: 1) If anyone has had COVID or received the first immunization shot, I'm considering them immune (probably not the best assumption, but the simplest, so I'm going with it for now) and 2) I'm assuming 3 unreported cases of COVID for each reported case (again may or may not be the best assumption, but gotta start somewhere) Side Note:  I've still seen some places suggesting that there are as many as 8 - 10 unreported cases per reported case.  However, if that were true, we'd already have hit herd immunity.  To that suggestion, 313000 new cases today say hello and goodbye.  With those assumptions in place, the nation as a whole has approximately 28.75% immunity, nowhere near herd immunity.  However, with the vaccination rollout and cases popping off like crazy right now, those numbers could climb quickly.   According to these numbers, North Dakota (53.65% immunity) and South Dakota (50.68% immunity) are the highest two states by far.  Interestingly enough, those two states are currently #47 (South Dakota with 49.6 new daily cases per 100k) and #48 (North Dakota with 31.3 new daily cases per 100k).  Is this simple reversion to mean, as these states were both popping off about a month ago, or could they actually be approaching herd immunity?  Either way, with both of them being two of the least populous states, even if both dropped to no new cases, it isn't going to do anything to the national numbers.   Either way, it looks as if herd immunity could be reached in at least various parts of the country well before this question ends.

Also new strains are possible. We know vaccine rollout has been slow so far, but Youyang Gu is modeling for that in his estimates. It's possible more vaccine availability by late spring/early summer could help here too, which he does not account for yet. Finally, he already models for current COVID infection estimates and how that will affect future cases. To summarize, from his baseline, there's one thing I think that may increase spread, one thing that might decrease it, and one thing that is already accounted for.

The march april may phase will target the rest of US and encounter doubters but if J&J single dose is available better delivery (single shot and normal refrigeration) . I have also thought about the US adopting the concept of just delivering the the first shot of the two shot COVID vaccine.  I do not believe the FDA would agree to extend the authorization to a protocol that has no data behind it. It seems like something they would wait for the president to authorize after he takes office. 50000 cases total in a 7 day period means everyday less than 7000 cases are diagnosed, that is a low number.

If we could do the same numbers with covid shots we'd be doing fine. So why can't we handle this exactly like flu shots? Pay pharmacies enough to make a decent profit on each shot and then they can pay the suppliers to supply the dosage. If extra-refrigeration equipment is required for transportation and storage, CVS, Walgreens and the transportation companies will happily buy and make room for the refrigeration equipment so long as they are still making a profit.  It seem instead of letting the market work, we have state governments trying to manage something which they have no competency to manage.  We didn't manufacture refrigeration equipment in parallel with manufacturing vaccines that require special refrigeration? How did someone not think of that? (I don't know if that's the case and hope it's not, but rest assured someone would have thought of it if you gave people a financial incentive to deliver the jabs.)  At least in Texas, currently, large hospitals have been given most of the vaccines and they are going through their patient lists and contacting them.

Give them to pharmacies, prioritize everyone who's in the correct tier group, but also let anyone else wait \"stand by\" to receive a shot should the line ever let up anywhere.

I've been tested 3 times: twice because I was going to visit others, another time because I had some symptoms. Friends tell me they have gotten tested because they had been in contact with someone else who tested positive.  If you have a more cavalier attitude toward Covid, it seems less likely you would be anxious to get vaccinated and less likely that you would get pre-emptively tested before an activity or because you were in the proximity of someone with Covid. However, unless you are a QAnoner, you might still get tested if you got a fever. So maybe the Covid cavalier are only 1/3rd as likely to get tested as the regular population and also much less likely to be vaccinated by June.  Then, assuming everyone who is in a hurry to be vaccinated gets a jab by early May, you would expect the confirmed infection rate among the non-vaccinated population to drop to 1/3 of what it would be if no such correlation existed.

If we assume three undetected cases per infection [1] the US has reached about 20-25% infections already. Even though I could not find reliable sounding estimates on the expected vaccination rate, I would expect that to be sorted out relatively quickly and at least another 20-25% being able to be vaccinated in the first half of the year. The currently basically unstopped spread would add another 46% (23 weeks left). This number is an overestimation as the effects of herd immunity will kick in prior to reaching that level. In particular, I would expect that places like NYC already see a slow down in spread due to saturation. But the real problem comes down to: Is it enough to reduce the spread by a factor of 30 (assuming that detection rates stay this low) or 120 (assuming the detection rate tends to 1). I assume yes but I may be a) slightly optimistic and b) underestimating the variation of the spread within the US and there could be pockets remaining that can sustain a 50+k infection rate per week for longer. [1] this is somewhat conservative but hard to judge and subject to massive variations probably at least down to the county level. Estimates for the US range from 6-24 in July.

Feels like there are a few things to consider - how quickly will the vaccine be rolled out, how rolled out does it need to be for herd immunity, and how does the roll out interact with other public health positions. On the roll out - a few sources: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-supply-us-100-million-additional-doses Chart halfway through this page: https://time.com/5921360/operation-warp-speed-vaccine-spending/ So - what we seem to know - doses for 100 million people due by 31st July (Pfizer), doses for 100 million people from Moderna (also approved already), not clear on timeline but I am assuming relatively similar timeline, 150 million people from AZ - not approved but seems pretty close to being approved and again presumably a similar timeline (possibly faster as it seems that the AZ vaccine is easier to manufacture?) and then J&J (I understand single dose so 100m) and a couple of others potentially kicking in before the end of Q1 next year. 328m people in the US - feels like to have that many vaccines out there in advance of 15 the June will require a few things, but not everything, to go right - probably needs AZ approved and those 3 providers to go a bit quicker than promised (although I suspect they have been careful not to overpromise) or Johnson and Johnson to come online early next year and roll out fast, or a couple of others to make it and roll out over the course of Q1. On the other hand - feels like being below 40 - 60% needs things to go wrong without anything else going right - still have c70% of the time to 31st July so Moderna and Pfizer alone should get there if everything goes to plan, and even if they have issues, one of the vaccines is less effective/does not work on one variant, problems with logistics of the roll out etc., just AZ should be able to pick up the slack, or one of the others further behind. 60 - 80% roll out - clearly somewhere in between - AZ coming through and all going to plan should get there, AZ coming through but a few issues could be compensated by J&J or another candidate coming through. Pfizer and Moderna over delivering could also get there. Putting some ranges here, let\u2019s say cumulatively:\n10 - 20% chance close to 100% vaccinated\n40 - 60% that 60 - 80% done\n80%+ that 40 - 60% done We do not seem to know what the threshold for Herd immunity is, but wiki thinks it is 60 - 80% covered (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity). So let\u2019s say 50% chance herd immunity occurs in the 60-80% threshold and 100% above that and zero chance below 60%. Finally - interaction with other public health measures. This seems quite tricky - Western Europe and US seem to have a pattern where they have r values in the 1.1 - 1.5 range, until cases get unacceptably high, then go through severe restrictions until they get it back to a more acceptable rate. Vaccine in the 40 - 60% range would seem to suggest that restrictions in place currently would take the r rate down to below 1 so should be possible even in the lower vaccination scenarios. However it may be that the benefit is \u201ctaken\u201d as more freedom and the US certainly found a run rate well above 50k as \u201cacceptable\u201d in September/October. In addition, we could well have a scenario where the vulnerable people are covered, deaths are low, but we have a high case load as people get back to normal without worrying about spread. On the flip side, Germany had case loads proportionally this low in Sep/Oct, there is a new us administration coming in that seems to want to fight covid hard (albeit, federal system and seperation of powers may limit the ability to do so), it may well be that clever vaccination means that the limits needed to bring down case loads are very \u201creasonable\u201d (offices closed where wfh works and no \u201cbig\u201d events like sports), plus the chance of a positive \u201cperfect storm\u201d where a large effort given current high caseloads, new admin, and vaccine coming through combine towards the end of Q1 to drastically reduce cases. I am putting a big range on the prob here of a non herd immunity drop in cases to this level; 15 - 60%. Taking the lower ends, you get:\n25% herd immunity (10% close to 100% vaccinated, 30% 60 - 80% vaccinated and half of that giving herd immunity.\nPlus  8% other positive outcomes) (55% good vaccine outcomes but no herd immunity and 15% a \u201cgood\u201d outcome.\nFor 33% total Higher ends you get:\n40% herd immunity\n36% other positive outcomes\n76% overall.

I'm betting that these folks will want the shot(s).   2) Winter will end, and people will spend more time outside. 3) To get campus life back to normal I would expect vaccination campaigns at colleges and universities to reach most students by April or May.  High school students should also be offered the vaccine. 4) By spring there may be a vaccine available that does not require two doses. 5) Nearly 6% of the US population has already tested positive for COVID.  Somewhere between 10% and 30% have probably developed some immunity.  Among those already infected are the people with the most social contacts who are most likely to have been super spreaders.

But if I'm wrong my forecast will be a disaster. 2)  After tens of millions of people get vaccinated, new infections could drop significantly.  If this causes complacency, and/or many low-risk people forgo a vaccination, the downward trend could slow.  To reach 50k in one week the rate of new infections must go down without a major interruption. 3) Initial vaccinations won't help much.  Sicker and older people will be saved, and should be first in line.  But the super spreaders are not in this demographic. 4) When there is sufficient vaccine to reach everybody will some people refuse the shots?

Unfortunately I do not believe this is even a remote possibility. The U.S. has not seen case numbers this low since the very beginning of the pandemic. To not go over 50,000 cases over a 7 day period, there would be an average of only 7,142.857 cases per day. According to the WHO, or any site tracking COVID, there hasn't been a 7 day average that low since the week of 9 March (or earlier), and the lowest case rate the U.S. has seen since was still at around 20,000 per day. With the dramatic increase we are about to see, I am not sure we can even get back down to 20,000 a day by then without another shutdown, and that seems unlikely considering the backlash from the last shutdown. I do no believe there will be enough vaccines available to make a dent by then either. I read an article recently that compares the vaccine to a fire hose to stop the spread of the virus. A highly effective Vaccine is a very strong fire hose. However, with the extremely high case rate we are seeing, we are taking a strong fire hose to fight the country's worst forest fire ever by comparison. If we had lower case rates, meaning it was just a small fire to put out, it would be a lot easier to see cases go down by then. Before the vaccine can be effective, we would need enough doses to vaccinate the majority of the population at the same time, or we would need a lower case rate and a good rate of vaccinations in areas where the cases are most prevalent. If the time frame were longer, say 15 December, I would have more faith in the vaccine helping to get case numbers that far down. However, our lowest case rate over a 7 day period since 9 March occurred during the week of 25 May, with an average case rate of 20,205 cases per day. The U.S. was nowhere near the case rate it is at now when the downward curve began, since the highest weekly rate was 219,073 in April before going down. We are seeing that many cases per day right now. The average case rate per week since 2 November in the U.S. is 1,047,842 new cases, and this includes the week of 2 November, which had 684,493 new cases according to the WHO. Without that week, the U.S. averaged 1,138,679 new cases per week during the last four weeks, and last week was 1,251,632 new cases in 7 days. It takes weeks to get the case numbers down after a surge that is significantly smaller than what we are seeing now, so who knows how long the current surge will effect us. The worst two months are yet to come, and I do not see it improving so drastically after spring comes that we see case numbers drop to about a third of what they were at our lowest case rate since the beginning of the pandemic.

The U.S. has not seen case numbers this low since the very beginning of the pandemic. To not go over 50,000 cases over a 7 day period, there would be an average of only 7,142.857 cases per day. According to the WHO, or any site tracking COVID, there hasn't been a 7 day average that low since the week of 9 March (or earlier), and the lowest case rate the U.S. has seen since was still at around 20,000 per day. With the dramatic increase we are about to see, I am not sure we can even get back down to 20,000 a day by then without another shutdown, and that seems unlikely considering the backlash from the last shutdown. I do no believe there will be enough vaccines available to make a dent by then either. I read an article recently that compares the vaccine to a fire hose to stop the spread of the virus. A highly effective Vaccine is a very strong fire hose. However, with the extremely high case rate we are seeing, we are taking a strong fire hose to fight the country's worst forest fire ever by comparison. If we had lower case rates, meaning it was just a small fire to put out, it would be a lot easier to see cases go down by then. Before the vaccine can be effective, we would need enough doses to vaccinate the majority of the population at the same time, or we would need a lower case rate and a good rate of vaccinations in areas where the cases are most prevalent. If the time frame were longer, say 15 December, I would have more faith in the vaccine helping to get case numbers that far down. However, our lowest case rate over a 7 day period since 9 March occurred during the week of 25 May, with an average case rate of 20,205 cases per day. The U.S. was nowhere near the case rate it is at now when the downward curve began, since the highest weekly rate was 219,073 in April before going down. We are seeing that many cases per day right now. The average case rate per week since 2 November in the U.S. is 1,047,842 new cases, and this includes the week of 2 November, which had 684,493 new cases according to the WHO. Without that week, the U.S. averaged 1,138,679 new cases per week during the last four weeks, and last week was 1,251,632 new cases in 7 days. It takes weeks to get the case numbers down after a surge that is significantly smaller than what we are seeing now, so who knows how long the current surge will effect us. The worst two months are yet to come, and I do not see it improving so drastically after spring comes that we see case numbers drop to about a third of what they were at our lowest case rate since the beginning of the pandemic.

This could either happen through herd immunity (through immunization or people already having had COVID-19) and through fast detection and isolation of those who are contagious. Using data from Stockholm, Sweden it seems that about 10% of those infected are detected, which would give that there are already 140 million infected in the US. On the other hand - with an estimated death rate of .6% the total number of infected would be 46 million. I think 46 million is more certain so let's estimate the number to a weighted average 1/3 - 2/3, giving 77 million in the beginning of December. This doubling to 154 million by the beginning of June is not unreasonable. Regarding vaccines - I haven't seen a lot of numbers for 2021, but this article https://www.businessinsider.com/when-can-i-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-2020-11?r=US&IR=T, mentions 30 million vaccines/ month in the beginning of the year (unclear if this is doses which would imply that the number treatments is half). Let's assume 15 million per month every month including May, which is 75 million people having been vaccinated by June 1. This would mean that 154+75 = 229 million could be immune. Of course some people who have already had the disease will receive the vaccine lowering this number say to 154+37.5=191.5. According to Herd immunity is believed to be reached when 60-80% of the population is immune (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/the-death-toll-would-be-enormous-fauci-says-of-herd-immunity-to-coronavirus-in-the-us.html). 191.5 million is 58% of the US population so almost within the herd immunity range. However, Fauci has said that he thinks it is possible that an \"overwhelming majority\" of the US population could be vaccinated by the end of June 2021, https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/528247-fauci-says-us-could-have-heard-immunity-by-end-of-summer-2021. In addition to this faster and more widespread testing would make tracing and isolating new cases easier. \nThe main risk in this is associated with the vaccination program - failure in distribution, failure in uptake in general population and failure in the safety or efficiency of the vaccine.

The current combination of vaccines will need to work out a way to ensure that people receive their second does to bring the effectiveness up to its maximum. So when rolling them out to the general population, the easiest way will be a federal government database. Yep, that's right, the only way to guarantee Americans can hit the target of \"early next year\" (1) is a federal database. Why? because people will not get to choose what they will be getting, so in order to ensure that a citizen can get their first dose in NY and the correct second does in Iowa is a register.  2. The number of vaccine hesitant and resistant individuals is very high. only 63% of health care workers polled by the CDC recently would get a vaccine, that's 37% who are hesitant at the very least. (2) 3. We don't know if transmission is prevented, which is terrifying. If it is not, even in places where there has been high adoption of anti-covid practices, people will relax once the first jabs start rolling out. There will be people that understand, and unfortunately the scenario where localized outbreaks are still happening after the vaccine is rolled out to gen pop is all to likely.  4. The outgoing admin has opted to major the transition difficult, I believe there is no Christmas stimulus, little coordination and nominal assistance from the Federal government. With the number of cases the US is looking to hit by Jan 20th, it would take months of full blown lockdown to bring the pandemic under control in 4 months. For example, the UK underwent a 1 month lockdown over October, and since coming out of their lockdown recently their daily new cases has halved from ~20k to ~10k. This kind of reduction only seems possible with a lockdown, which I think people are less interested in than a national register.  5. The time to distribute and the order of application of the vaccine is not the fastest way to reduce cases (but makes a lot of sense). Health care workers first, absolutely, but if you want to stop the pandemic the quickest, the next group are essential workers, not the elderly, and not the sick. (I agree with the current roll out plan, I'm not advocating for keeping the immuno-compromised and elderly at risk).

That is 47% of population, which is still below effective herd immunity.  So herd immunity will not be stopping the case count. It will be intersting to see the cdc december update of vaccination plan now that pfizer is going to production and distribution.  We may be able to get a chart kf vaccination rates and production schedule.  Also there are other vaccines like moderna that will be announcing phase 3 eesults.  These will improve the supply side of the project. So rather being too negative, i am being positive that the supply a vaccine from multiple manufacturers will allow the 100 million vaccinations.

The big contingency comes down to logistics (this needs to be kept at -69C/-92F) and that the 90% effectiveness rate is also for a preliminary investigation into the results, and even if people are being vaccinated by early Jan (8 weeks away), this is a limited selection of the population that has been living under the Trump admin's response to the virus for 8 weeks - I believe Pence (head of Covid19 task force) is on vacation and Trump has been hanging out playing golf while the daily number of new cases is almost equal to India, Italy, Russia, Poland, UK and France combined.

If he has a hostile Senate, expect social division to widen and a Republican President in 2024) and at this stage we do not know if this vaccine impacts transmissibility, it may simply ensure 90% of us definitely live and the other 10% can hope for the best.

The big factors making that possible would be immunity due to spread of the virus and immunity due to a vaccine, which I would think would be fairly prevalent by then. Another could be measures taken by a president Biden, such as mask mandates or a more aggressive test and trace program. Factors making it unlikely are low seroprevalence (just briefly googling around it still looks like estimates put the country as a whole as less than 10% having antibodies) and low vaccine usage (some surveys indicate only 50% or so of the population might get it) and just the data we have for spread of the virus in the US to date.
