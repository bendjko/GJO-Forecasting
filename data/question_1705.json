Giving more seats to the USDP would directly mean a continuation of the tedious idea of rulership of the pre-2011 military junta, which Myanmar's former prime minister Thein Sein has served, who has also been an important member to the USDP and its party leader between October 2012 and May 2013; those with influence in the party will still be people closely tied to Th. Sein, although he appears to have receded to being a simple member.\nHowever, the USDP has raked devastating election results in the 2015 general election, losing 90 per cent of their seats in \"House of Nationalities\" (upper house; 11 versus 112 seats in 2012) and 87 per cent of their 2012 seats in the House of Representatives (29 versus 222 in 2012).\nSo the question really is about the survival of the military-linked principle of rulership in Myanmar, and a possible normalization of the election turnout (the USDP would then still be opposition), or - as a possible outcome catalyzed by either the purported discontent with the USDP and the very negative views of the party in the most recent poll analysis - a renunciation of Thein Sein's heritage and old structures to achieve a full scale democracy (as far as the complicated ethnic structure and the very splintered parliament allows this: as a result from the 08 Nov 2015 there were 10 different parties plus the military in the House of Representatives beyond the ruling NLD and the USDP (opposition appears weak and fragmented)), and a dwindling of the USDP in these 2020 elections. Right now, I overweight a scenario in which the USDP is becoming even weaker. / the EU tries to support free and safe elections by sending electoral experts to monitor the polls.
