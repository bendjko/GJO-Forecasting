A sea confrontation would be perceived as an escalation even more serious than the \"skirmishes\" on the border which can be attributed to soldiers losing temper, or similar reasons (though not 100% well-funded). There will be less open doors to avoid conflict if there's a lethal confrontation between military forces at sea. Thus, I assess only an accidental lethal confrontation could occur. I did not find reasonable figures giving probabilities of accident in the territorial waters and in the regions neighboring China and India (where it is the more likely to occur, I neglect other regions). On the top of it, we must assess the probability of escalation to be lethal (unless the accident is serious enough to make casualties).

The fact that the question presents the possibility of these \"forces\" being militia and law enforcement raises the probability that a lethal confrontation could occur, both because it is a larger class of actors than exclusively military forces but also because China has used their LE forces heavily in the the South China Seas. Here's a great visual reference on the use of LE in maritime disputes in the SCS since 2010 (note that this does not show disputes relative to military forces) to demonstrate when, how, where and resolution of these disputes: https://csis-ilab.github.io/cpower-viz/csis-china-sea/ Note that India is not listed in any of the maritime disputes in the SCS, which tend to revolve around territorial/sea claims. Nevertheless, China shows it routinely uses ramming, harassment, arrest, official protest, shooting, water cannon, and has detained foreign individuals for alleged activities that violate Chinese sovereignty--all activities that could quickly escalate in a situation where China perceived India was in unauthorized sea territory. I am not confident that losing an individual or two during a detainment or arrest would make it into the press, either.  China is active in the Indian Ocean at a rate of approx 7-8 warships at any given time, so there is also an opportunity for confrontation there as well, albeit limited. It is interesting to consider how China might escalate in defending its encroachments into India's EEZ waters. I think this is a more interesting question and actually an important indicator of the extent China intends to make claims well outside its immediate territory but within the region. I will be on the lookout for any changes in Chinese posture when challenged by Indian naval forces or LE to leave India's EEZ waters, both as an indicator of longer-term Chinese regional intentions and to change this forecast. If China starts to challenge India's direction to leave their EEZ waters, I will increase my forecast probability here.  India has been very vocal about the SCS being part of international waters and free to navigate for all this year, expressing the intent to conduct freedom-of-navigation ops in the SCS, as of mid-year 2020. It is unclear if these FON ops have commenced. Overall, it seems that despite India's vocalness on this issue, there is presently a pretty low opportunity for conflict in the SCS for their forces. Given that India's joint summit with ASEAN this month focused on the importance of continued exercise of FON in the \"vital sea lane\" in the SCS: http://www.ecoti.in/Qdvtpb96 and 30% of their total trade transits the SCS (https://chinapower.csis.org/much-trade-transits-south-china-sea/), I expect this to remain a big issue for them through 2021. If India were to commence FON operations in the SCS, to conduct a FON exercise in the SCS, or to escort any of its trade carriers, I'd increase my forecast.  My inside view on this is that China could flex some coercive muscle in the early 2021 timeframe when the US is focused on the peaceful transition of power domestically, both to reassert dominance vis-a-vis India, to 'punish' them for the June 2020 border skirmish and also for dropping out of the RCEP. Wouldn't it be nice for China to get India to accede to the regional power hierarchy sooner rather than later?  In sum,\n1. low base rate, as established by @benjuliano1(extrapolating roughly from that base rate logic, gives me 13.7% probability from today up to March 1, 2021)\n2. relatively high tension period, with deadly land conflict in June 2020\n3. increased probability of rising Indian forces activity in SCS, creating more opportunity for forces to come into contact\n4. fleeting opportunity for the US to be obsessively focused on domestic power transition\nToday, I estimate the probably at 15%."], [96893, "2020-11-23T21:05:13Z", [0.1], "Comment deleted on Nov 23, 2020 09:05PM UTC"], [1034, "2020-11-23T18:08:16Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-11-23T15:20:26Z", [0.01], ""], [57854, "2020-11-22T18:33:48Z", [0.05], "The land border remains tense.

See https://reut.rs/39ikTBM. This may further ratchet up tensions that could lead to a lethal accident at sea. Updated 20201117 Forecast probability unchanged today. More rationale.  Regarding the question in point, three elements stand out; a) a lethal conflict, b) 'between the forces of...' and c) at sea. For element a) the assumption is that at least one death occurs as outlined.  However, we know from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) clash in eastern Ladakh between Indian and PLA in May - June 2020, China never disclosed details of injured or wounded, whereas India gave details of numbers of deaths, injuries etc. Thus, it's possible that we may never know the real situation if there is a lethal confrontation and the fatalities occur on the Chinese side. Regarding b), I will assume this is purely naval and / or military uniformed forces and does not include militia such as militarily trained fishing vessels. As for c) 'the sea' could in principle be anywhere in international waters or more likely, the coastal waters of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Pakistan.  As below, China's current focus appears to be more the South China Seas (SCS). However, also as referenced below. Chinese naval vessels are increasingly encroaching into India's EEZ. The recent maritime exercises hosted by India along with Japan, Australia and USA (see https://bit.ly/2H9tFX8), currently referred to as 'The Quad', have not been well received by China. See https://bit.ly/35FmAqF The recent signing of the The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with the ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand is generally considered to be a diplomatic success for China albeit it has been roughly 15 years in the making and the developed economies realise this simply extends China's economic influence. India was initially part of the negotiations. However, India withdraw last year. Ostensibly because of the threat to tariff free trade in agricultural products and the impact that would have on Indian farmers. Some commentators hold that Modi was more concerned about China's influence. Clearly relations between India and China have deteriorated in the last 12 months. Thus, tensions and China's deepening relationship with Pakistan and the Belt and Road project provide potential for a confrontation at sea. As at 20201109: Currently, my perception is that China's focus is the South China Seas (SCS) as this is a more strategic geopolitical element of the current CCP leaderships hegemony focus. Hence, as India is not directly involved in SCS issues and threats at the moment, I only allocate a 5% probability to the outcome. However, there has been an increase in Chinese naval vessels in the Indian Ocean in the past 12 months - See https://bit.ly/36jzaer & https://bit.ly/32qXkT4 & V.

Extrapolating that out we would expect the next one to occur around April 2022. That doesn\u2019t mean that the battle would be lethal. Roughly 40 to 60 percent of naval confrontations in the past two decades have been lethal. [1]. Our logical so far tells us that a naval standoff is not likely before the stated day of 1 March 2021. With that in mind, let\u2019s add some detail from the Sino-Indian situation addressed in the question. I won\u2019t go into detail about the Sino-India border conflict but we know that in its 80-year history both sides have shown a strong preference for engagement on land rather than at sea. There are historical reasons for this which make it a weaker precedent than in other cases. Both China and India have industrialized rapidly over the past three decades. China has invested heavily in its naval capabilities. In its report on the subject to Congress released early this month, the Department of Defense noted \u201cChina has already achieved parity with\u2014or even exceeded\u2014the United States in several military modernization areas\u201d. [2] We should note this however in the context of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s wider strategy and mandate. \u201cChina\u2019s leaders use tactics short of armed conflict to pursue China\u2019s objectives. China calibrates its coercive activities to fall below the threshold of provoking armed conflict with the United States, its allies and partners, or others in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d say the top brass. [3]  On the other hand, China will not miss an opportunity to project its power and views sea assets as critical to that mission given the strategic importance that both countries place on their proximity to major trade thoroughfares in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean respectively. The so-called \u2018String of Pearls\u2019 is evidence that China is preparing for a massive sea-based mobilization against India. Of course, no such action is inevitable but it is credible to posit that the Chinese see wisdom in preparing for a transition from land-based confrontation. Up to this point all five major incidents have occurred in the border regions. [5] Here\u2019s how I see these pieces fitting together.  1.\tWe have a low base rate. 153 days until 1 March divided by 674 days average time between generic naval confrontations yields a 23.7 percent chance of some kind of generic naval event.\n2.\tWe are at the highest tension point between the two powers in 50 years. A conflict that has been historically land-based but shows signs of spilling over to high seas although when that will happen, we can\u2019t be sure. [6]\n3.\tJust because there is a confrontation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will be lethal. Reducing it by half seems deep given the rising tension so a 25 percent might be a better figure. Final judgement, if there is a confrontation it is more likely to be land-based. Naval clashes are an increasing, albeit remote possibility. 18 percent. Comments welcome.

Considering other perspectives in calculating.  Escalation at sea entails higher visibility and has great consequence than fighting in the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  The entire world uses the Indian Ocean as a trade route and conflict there would have impacts on neutral players, unlike the LAC (between China and India). Given the high stakes of conflict between two nuclear powers, China and India will continue dialogue and diplomacy in attempts to avoid future conflict; especially at sea.   The BRICS partnership is also another forum for China and India to address grievances and demonstrate their willingness to work things out short of armed conflict. It is a fact that both China and India are both increasing the size of their navies; especially coast guard and other law enforcement type assets to protect and monitor their territorial claims.  Chinese expansion with projects such as the BRI, involve increasing use of trade routes and naval assets.  Increased maritime operations and exercises on both sides, will bring Chinese and Indian assets into greater interaction and closer proximity as time goes on.  Interestingly, after the Galwan Valley incident, India dispatched a warship to the South China Sea.  Another assumption (as it stands currently), China nor India (unless supported from Allies) could go in to each other's backyard and win a naval campaign.  This may limit starting something you can't finish, but it could also be seen as risk reduction if contemplating more aggressive action in their backyard.  Also, based on the geographic location of the LAC, I don't foresee a fatality in the airspace as it relates to this question. Therefore, chance of lethal confrontation is highly unlikely, but their is always a chance of human error at lower levels, and the LAC situation is not helping.   good article to add to the others: https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/could-the-india-china-border-conflict-lead-to-a-naval-war"], [691, "2020-09-26T19:40:52Z", [0.01], ""], [59836, "2020-09-26T18:26:34Z", [0.01], ""], [88002, "2020-09-26T18:21:46Z", [0.01], ""], [93350, "2020-09-26T17:51:00Z", [0.0], "China\u2019s intention is to protect its trade routes, energy lines etc. via the Strait of Malacca  that connect the Indian ocean to the , South China Sea and Pacific ocean.
