This is the information given on Thursday 31 August 2017 by President Alassane Ouattara, after his meeting with his French counterpart.  \"Abidjan is a city of 5 million inhabitants. Environmental and transport issues need to be addressed. And we have great hope for the realization of this project so that things will come into operation before 2020, \"said the Ivorian Head of State.  Before him, the French President recognized the importance of such a project for all Ivorians. \"It is a project that is dear to both of us. For France, this project reached a record in terms of financing, which is fully justified by its importance. I am delighted as a result of the finalization of the contract, \"said Emmanuel Macron. \"It is a project that represents an unprecedented French offer combining all the technologies of our companies that will allow an urban development of the city of Abidjan\".

There are many reasons for riots and protests which are not forecasted as these activities generally flare for unexpected reasons on many levels. Although there are areas of the world where protests are ongoing (1), and have become threads in the fabric of society, there are those which are possible but not necessarily expected due to one event within a construct of tension (2), or areas that have a library of complaints against others (3),  and use events to demonstrate or riot. A person could have been run over by someone from another religion or tribe which could lead to demonstrations, or a leader of a group who denounces others, or someone viewed as being taken in by police. \nThese demonstration may have ulterior motives which have nothing to do with an event, such as toppling a government or gaining religious, tribal, labor, monetary, or political leverage through popular dissent. These are some of the issues in Cote d' Ivory which could cause a demonstration. Youth unemployment. Although unemployment for youth has decreased from 14% in 2014 to 13.8% in 2016 for those in the job market (4), the drop has not been keeping up with funds that have been invested in the country by nations and NGO's for economic expansion. Their economy is based on agriculture which is not guaranteed. They export oil and its products, which is volatile in the market. Less then half the males are literate and less than 1/3 are literate, (5) with 60% of the population under 25 (ibid).\nThe North-South Division. The nation is divided between the Christian south and the Moslem north, along with economic inequality between them and the question of who has citizenship in the country, as many in the north lack citizenship papers as had the current president from the north, Alassane Ouattara.\nCoups. There were several coups in Ivory Coast, they are not usual, but not unusual in the country. The New Forces in the army have made a scism between soldiers and officers as well as wage inequality between the rank and file in the armed services. \nTerrorism. The south near the capital had a terrorist attack this year by members of an Islamist militant group. \nAny of these tensions or sub-conflicts or ulterior motives betweens groups could cause a demonstration or riot, and the reason given is not always the reasons behind the activity. \nThis is not exhaustive but is indicative of the political, cultural, and economic schism in the area. \nThe events are not likely in August, but may require further monitoring.

I'm double-posting here (as well in a comment thread below) because I want to get wider feedback from anyone here.  This is why my vote is low when the average is so much higher.   There are protests reported in Ivory Coast that are NOT on the ACLED database that I would expect if they are aiming to record every single protest (and not every protest that becomes violent, that is unplanned and shows anger/frustration that could lead to violence, etc) then these should be included.  If they aren't, then it probably has something to do with the fact that the researching hosting the database are human and only have so much time, so they focus on major protests that make major news sources (protest is kind of an art and cultural right in Francophone cultures, after all), the idea being that only the really significant ones will be picked up outside of Ivory Coast.  Of course, since this one was picked up, it's possible it will be listed in ACLED's database for August.  But there are so many that aren't and seem at least if not much more serious (though the serious ones usually coincide with months where other more serious protests/riots occur). Do you think ACLED records only some?  If so, which ones?  I think the prediction of this question really hinges on what the researchers recording see/access (perhaps based on which sources they choose), and whether they are pre-sorting for protests that seem more connected to political instability/violence or are likely to lead to it (though several of the protests they recorded don't seem connected to much in context) Here are ones that I didn't see in the ACLED database - first for 2017 and then for 2015-2016 (hope the links aren't broken; feel free to verify my research): On 16 June 2017 opposition \u201cmilitants\u201d storm Cocody / Seat aof govt over appointments to govt positions \nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-pdci-protestation-contre-nouvelles-nominations-accusation-contre-bedie-davoir-finance-rebellion-guikahue-sexplique-110296.html Trade unions in Bouak\u00e9 strike/protest for 3 days starting on 14 June 2017.\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-bouake-jours-greve-collectif-syndicats-mairie-corps-bloques-morgue-110217.html A strike by teachers at the Universit\u00e9 de Bouak\u00e9 on 7 June 2017 to protest treatment by students (which was apparently successful since they [self]reported that campuses were empty).\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-universite-bouake-enseignants-decretent-jours-greve-pour-protester-contre-lagression-collegue-110141.html Strike announced by the National Teachers Union over salary (though I found no article follow up that it actually took place).\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-enseignants-personnels-prive-laic-annoncent-greve-illimitee-pour-juin-prochain-109721.html\nPossibly because the national minister of education announced a salary increase for new teachers?\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-solde-tardive-premier-salaire-enseignants-sortis-cafop-solution-serait-cours-selon-kandia-camara-109942.html Another strike, this time by taxi drivers that lasted 3 days, 31 May 2017 to 2 June 2017.\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-pedro-chauffeurs-taxis-greve-pour-protester-contre-mauvais-etat-voies-109808.html Tech & admin personnel went on strike at a university protested rights (salary, overtime, etc) on 8 May 2017. \nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-greve-luniversite-nangui-abrogoua-pour-denoncer-mepris-abus-109115.html Student protest on 3 May 2017 in Yamoussoukro over the cost of enrollment and BTE exams (new biometric registration process?)\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-greve-initiee-cegept-paralyse-cours-dans-grandes-ecoles-yamoussoukro-108982.html Another student strike in Tiebissou on 2 May 2017 that is not connected to the 2 May clash between students and Police in Abidjan.\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-duperie-linfpa-etudiants-tiebissou-entrent-greve-apres-lannulation-dune-filiere-108920.html A political protest (riot?) in Akour\u00e9 on 28 April 2017 \nhttp://www.connectionivoirienne.net/126069/cote-divoire-le-fpi-maintient-sa-manifestation-a-akoure-la-police-forcee-de-quitter-le-village Protests in Cocody (Abidjan) on 10 April 2017 by taxi drivers at the town hall near the UEMOA presidents\u2019 meeting didn\u2019t make it on the list\nhttp://koaci.com/cote-divoire-protestations-mairie-cocody-loin-sommet-presidents-luemoa-108249.html Student protests in Odienn\u00e9 on 10 April 2017 over a reduction in the Easter holiday from 15 days to 1 week.

"], [37488, "2017-08-15T14:15:01Z", [0.2], "ACLED data shows that August is consistently the lowest month for protests, though there has been some volatility there.  The issues at the heart of that are being addressed at least in short term - back pay to several groups, particularly those in the military/mutiny, efforts to introduce some reforms to limit cost of living increases and protect farmers and other workers (since one of the common tension points seems to be economic success in many areas while poverty/poor wages/poor back pay for public servants and workers in other areas = frustration & resentment).  Based on comments in interviews & local news websites, there seems to be a lot of skepticism about how long that will last and how much good these placating measures will do, but no expectation of violence erupting.  There has also been ongoing/recent activity concerning the 2020 election calling on supporters to back candidates based on loyalties and connections to previous parties where there are very deep divides.   Strikes are not uncommon; it's not clear to me whether ACLED's definition of protests as \"spontaneous demonstrations\" includes these kinds of planned strikes over pay or conditions (e.g. the hospital strike over pay which was handled in a day), and it rather seems that is doesn't since news in 2016 included more strikes in Ivory Coast than ACLED recorded as \"protest/riot\".  Although most riots/protests in August in Ivory Coast happen in the latter half of the month and September is predictably one of the highest months of protest, this seems like it is more likely to be a relatively calm year and see more activity in Sept Oct or even Dec.  If I understand the govt. schedule, the legislative branches end their sessions in July and don't start up again until late September with only minor activity in August for the national celebration, and nothing in the news suggest that there are critical needs that haven't been addressed, unpopular laws or policies that were enacted, etc.  And there is enough evidence to suggest that the military protests have been taken care of, at least temporarily, and the violence that has recently erupted around it has no longer been tagged at \"protest/riot. Highest chance of protest/riot seems to come from issues surrounding cocoa production (e.g., military mutiny over bonuses not paid by govt because spring cocoa sales complicated by low demand & laws from 2016 that increased prices leading to buyers backing out of contracts and problems throughout spring of 2017 after an already slow oct-dec harvest in 2016, etc.).  It seems as if the govt is trying to smooth things out and everyone is waiting to see how the summer flooding/rains will affect the harvest, which is expected to be large again this year.  Although contracts are up and the govt tariffs seem to have been reduced from the change from fall 2016/early spring 2017, things may be hard this year as supply is still expected to be high.  However, last fall and this spring the govt was seen to be at fault and is now trying to manage the situation better, and the higher expectations for September post-harvest sales will probably keep tensions down until at least early/mid September\nhttps://www.adamtooze.com/2017/04/16/notes-global-condition-easter-2017-cocoa-crisis/\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/business-39081453\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-04/ivory-coast-said-to-sell-1-million-tons-of-next-main-cocoa-crop\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-02/floods-stall-ivory-coast-cocoa-harvest-as-farmers-fret-over-rot\n"], [36976, "2017-08-15T05:03:09Z", [0.5], "ACLED data shows average of multiple riots per month in 2017"], [30364, "2017-08-15T04:12:42Z", [0.75], ""], [23234, "2017-08-15T03:45:00Z", [0.5], ""], [1528, "2017-08-15T03:40:34Z", [0.71], "decreasing as time passes"], [38193, "2017-08-15T01:37:00Z", [0.2], ""], [37573, "2017-08-14T23:17:58Z", [0.1], ""], [22689, "2017-08-14T22:06:11Z", [0.45], ""], [38012, "2017-08-14T21:19:58Z", [1.0], "There was a riot in early August"], [15548, "2017-08-14T19:11:43Z", [0.75], ""], [37224, "2017-08-14T18:44:13Z", [0.1], "No current news coming from Cote d'Ivoire....halfway through the month.
