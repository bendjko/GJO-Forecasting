That may increase the urgency as the Federal Reserve withdraws economic support.\n. . . \nThe combination of a healing job market and the threat that price increases will jump out of control has prompted central bankers to speed up their plans to withdraw policy help from the economy. Fed officials are already slowing the big bond purchases they had been using to support the economy. In addition to that, they could raise rates three times in 2022, based on their estimates, and economists think those increases could begin as soon as March. \n. . . \nAnd officials have signaled that once rate increases start, they could promptly begin to shrink their balance sheet \u2014 where they hold the bonds they have purchased to stoke growth throughout the pandemic downturn.
