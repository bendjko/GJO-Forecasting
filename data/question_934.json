Note: InsideEV's numbers are only for the U.S. Deliveries in Canada started in May.  One spotted shipment in Toronto numbered at 1,000 in late May [1]. Another report mentions \"hundreds of deliveries per day\" at the end of May [2]. This suggests that deliveries there are an order of magnitude higher than what I assumed before.  To  summarize the main uncertainties are:\n- Will Tesla withhold US deliveries to avoid exceeding the 200k threshold? (My guess: 80% chance)\n- Is InsideEv correct about how close (5k) Tesla is to hitting that threshold? (My guess: 85% chance)\n- How high will Canadian deliveries be for May and June?

I used a decision tree and assigned probabilities to each uncertainty, calculated the final probabilities and then summed those outcomes that correspond to >29k and <29k.

Assuming Model S and X sales of about 3k per month, it doesn't leave much room for Model 3. Even if we assume restricted Model S and X sales (wouldn't be the first time Tesla is putting Model 3 first) we still don't have much room. InsideEV also has deliveries as of end of May for Model 3 at 20k. So, whether we end up in the <29k bin depends on two things:  - whether Tesla will optimize around the tax credit, which I think is not certain but likely.\n- the accuracy of InsideEV's numbers. This pertains to their April and May numbers only as the rest has been confirmed and adjusted to match Tesla's numbers. It's difficult to systematically assess their past accuracy (for example they estimated Jan and Feb 2018 and then just filled in March based on whatever remained to match Tesla's numbers it seems) They did report that they have previously adjusted Model S quarterly numbers by ~5-10%. If I assume April and May numbers are actually 10% higher and 10k deliveries in June (consistent with recent production + a lag) then we barely get to 29k.

Bloombergs Tesla Tracker https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/ is showing 32,501 as of 0105, May 30th.   I know from experience with Audi that it takes 5 and 8 days to receive a car from the East Coast ON AN OPEN CARRIER once they leave the port.  Open carriers are the trucks you see with 8-10 cars stacked on the trailer, and because of which they have more stops to make, driver hours need to reset, etc., etc..  Enclosed carriers (Reliable Transport, United Transport) are the ones that look like moving vans but the trailers lack the multitude of doors on the side of the van, these only carry 2-4 because they do not have elevated tracks.  Fewer cars per transport, higher shipping costs, faster shipping, but more time to burn through the inventory.    Economically \"open carriers\" are dramatically more affordable and according to chatter many owners are receiving their cars this way.  They're also receiving their cars with other brands on the trailer, some of which are European brands...  This means that they are squeezing cars on the next available truck on the open market freight load boards like truckstop.com or DAT.com, which reverts back to the same issue you'd encounter with enclosed carriers - fewer cars going out per truck and a longer inventory burn rate.   So after all that, I got really curious I looked at (2018) satellite photos of the Fremont plant and counted a total of 688 vehicles waiting for shipping, with space for ~2000 more on the north end of the complex.  Their loading area (800 feet North by Northwest of the rail terminus) shows two very interesting things....  1: that only four trucks are being loaded and 2:  that one of them (in the middle of the three on the south end) is a \"hot shot\" which is basically a pickup truck with a trailer.  These are normally used for routes less than 800 miles and can carry 1-3 cars.  This shows that they are using non-dedicated trucking services; ie, they are desperate to get cars out.  It takes roughly 2 hours to load an auto carrier since each car is normally driven on by the truck driver, who also has to manipulate the hydraulics, chain down each car, secure the keys with the bill of lading, then go get the next car.  They have 6 marked loading spots with space for 12 (as we see one alone by itself north of the other three).  So at best, they can ship 384 per 8 hour shift...  But that's not how logistics works.  LOL.  From real world experience, assume there are no more than 3 trucks there at any given time, that it takes 3 hours to load, and that about 15 trucks per shift averaging 7 cars per truck.  These numbers are on par with their 30,000 deliveries in Q1.  https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/  3*15*7*90=28350.   We know that the X and S are also produced at the same facility so let's just assume that as much as half of the production and shipping is Model 3's, or 15000, or 5000 per month.   So....  In conclusion....   32,501 cars produced to date, with 5000 shipping per month with a maximum 10 day delivery period, or an average of 5 days (5/6th of a month) per car on each truck.

We got just in the last 24 hours at the Gigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day \u2013 sorry, per week, and actually reached a peak hour with extrapolated outward would be a rate of about 5,000 cars per week.\" Going off Bloomberg's VERY helpful Model 3 Production Tracker (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/), we have around 27k right now, with just over six weeks left for the question. However, as @healther mentioned, it can take a while for them to be delivered. While there is no steadfast number, many people on the Tesla motor club forum say that theirs are delivered within 2-4 weeks of being ordered. Now, subtracting from those 6 weeks 2-4, 27k + 4.2k x 2-4  = 35k-44k. I put a 20% chance of More than 43,000 but less than 50,000 if Musk raises production substantially (as in closer to 5k, as he has talked about) and a 5% chance of 50,000 or more if he somehow magically boosts production way above that 4.2 mark (hey, it could happen. Especially with Elon Musk. You never know.). However, just in case the leak is false, I hade to put some safety margin in there with a 20% chance of More than 29,000 but less than 36,000.

With another 6 weeks to go we would end up at 48k, but there is a shutdown of 6-7 days scheduled and the question asks for deliveries not produced units. Counteracting these two reductions is the ramp up of the production rate itself. \nIf we assume about a week for the delivery (they claim to be faster, but that is hard to verify) we have 25k delivered as of today, with 5 weeks (13k with current rate) left. This means we Tesla would end up with 38k, slightly above the 36k. There are 5k missing to the next bracket end (1-2 weeks of production, for current to target end of Q2 production rate). Ways to achieve 43k+: \n- ramp up production faster \n- reduce downtime\n- reduce delivery time\nThe first is possible, but would need on the order of 1k/week additional vehicles with corresponds to an increase of 40%. While not unheard of, this seems optimistic. The second is unlikely as Tesla doesn't usually underestimate how long things take, so it might be 5 days instead of 6, but that ends up being maybe .5k vehicles. The last one is the big uncertainty. Ways to end up <36k:\n- extend downtime of factory\n- slow deliveries \nSo far Tesla's problems originated in being too optimistic in how well their upgrades work, but they haven't screwed up something in an actually damaging way.

To a large extent this depends on whether Tesla decides to optimize around the federal tax credit. See some other important considerations below.  Key points:  1) Tesla has an incentive to not hit a 200k sales threshold by end of Q2 so that it's customers can still use the federal tax credit throughout Q3. \"The $7500 FIT credit will be phased out starting at the end of the quarter in which Tesla reaches 200,000 US sales.\"  \"As of the end of Q2 [I assume author means Q1 here], US sales of Tesla Models S, X and 3 stood at 175,000 units. Assuming sales of 9,000 model S and X for Q2 leaves room for 16,000 Model 3 to be sold in the USA in Q2.\" This suggests that Tesla may employ strategies to delay deliveries in the US. This could mean delivering more cars in Canada. So one big implication from this is that the answer to this question may depend on how many deliveries are made to Canada specifically. It could also mean lengthening the gap between production and delivery, accumulating cars at the factory that Tesla then delivers to customers beginning of Q2. The model presented in the article does suggest a widening between production and deliveries in April. The author estimates \"up to 5,000 cars held back for delivery in the first week of July to stay under the 200,000 FIT cap\" There is a further question about the ability of Tesla's delivery/service infrastructure to keep up with higher production rates. Could that be another bottleneck? There is a comment below the article that talks about this. An overarching comment on this: Tesla is being largely evaluated on weekly production, not deliveries. So all of the recent news about new hires, 24/7 operation, optimizing the line, is probably focused on raising the production number to appease investors. As for deliveries, Tesla has latitude on how it decides to time them. 2) The author interprets, as I did, Musk's letter to mean there will be another shutdown in May. 3) Bringing on all the new hires will take time: \"I am not expecting a major increase in production until the end of the quarter. Tesla will need 2,000 to 2,500 workers for a full third shift working a seven-day week. It will take at least six weeks to hire and train all those workers, so the third shift is unlikely to be added until the end of May at the earliest, most likely after the May shutdown.\" An additional problem is that Tesla might not have the tools needed to equip these workers. Ordering those will also take time.  The author implies that the production is a function mostly of the number of workers. I am not sure I agree with that. The shutdown in April will help Tesla optimize the line so output per worker should also be higher. 4) The author says 6,000 per week target \"is intended to be only a *one day* \u201cburst-build\u201d rate for each department, it does not set a target of 6,000 per week for the whole operation. This suggests it's unlikely to see weekly numbers anywhere close to that.  5) The author estimates 20k deliveries in the US and Canada in Q2. This translates to 29,952 deliveries in total by July 1. This made me question whether Model 3's are being delivered anywhere outside the US and Canada. It seems the answer is 'no' from this article (https://electrek.co/2018/03/21/tesla-model-3-canada-price/). It will be important to watch whether Tesla opens up markets elsewhere.

Data sources: This website below links to a google spread sheet where customers have entered their delivery times. In total 780 customers (a decent sample size). The average time between when the customer received their VIN and delivery is *12.7 days*. (VIN registration is not the same as production though - as per Bloomberg: \"Automakers register VINs in large batches that anticipate coming production, which means that numbers will be assigned before a new car starts its journey down the assembly line.\" https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). So this number is an overestimate of the lag.  Additionally, the average is a little misleading for our purposes because the data is skewed to the right with a low number of customers experiencing very long delays. Both the median and the mode are 10 days. These are not working days but total days including weekends. So a bit less than 2 weeks on average. There is more analysis I wish I could do on this data but time constraints force me to leave it at that. Here is the link: https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/time-vinfinished-production-delivery-date-or-more-info Similarly, Tesla's Q1 announcement shows deliveries lag production by 1,586, which at their end-Q1 rate is about a week.  Future assumption:  The question still stands about the delivery lag for Q2. Especially - will the current efforts to ramp up at the Fremont factory do anything to lower this delivery lag? I actually doubt it. Musk's focus is on the production number. That's the metric he committed to so I assume that's what Wall Street is mostly looking at (though of course they cannot let deliveries sag too much). So I assume it will stay the same and it will be a little more than a week. Implications: This is an important assumption because any ramp ups toward the last week or two of Q2 (which I expect since Musk's 6k target and the official 5k target for end Q2 is a \"burst-built\" target as I mentioned earlier) will not be captured in the delivery data.  Based on this I find the >50k bin virtually impossible.

Please share any feedback! Here is the overarching point that I base my thinking on: extrapolating from past data (and more generally from our prior about Tesla that they always miss their targets) has become less useful for the purposes of this question after Musk's concerted push to alleviate Wall Street's concerns. The factory update this week, the move to 24/7 operation and the new hires that Musk wants to bring on will, I assume, significantly improve the factory's capacity. So I did a bottom-up estimation of total deliveries based on Musk's targets and comments. This is meant as an optimistic case that can help set the upper boundary. I also provide a few alternative models. Deliveries to date: There is some uncertainty, with Bloomberg data being updated retroactively, so I took this approach: the last confirmed number by Bloomberg was 12,452 deliveries by end of Q1 (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). For the weekly deliveries since then I am using numbers reported by Musk himself in his company email from this week (https://electrek.co/2018/04/17/tesla-model-3-production-goal-6000-units-per-week/), which suggests 2,070 for the week of April 2 and 2,250 for the week of April 9. This means that as of the beginning of this week there were 16,772 deliveries. Week of April 16: 0 (assuming  plant stays closed) Next two weeks: assume plant comes back at the pre-closure rate of 2,250 and goes up in the following week to 3,000. This is trying to capture a ramp up to a number mentioned by Musk who wrote that the current closure should allow the factory to reach 3-4k weekly rate for May. First three weeks of May: 3,500 per week as the midpoint of Musk's estimate Last week of May: 0 (assuming plant closure alluded to by Musk's email which says \"Another set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June.\"  First three weeks of June: 3500. This is quite uncertain. It depends on how the plant ramps up production over time. An important consideration here is that the 6k target mentioned by Musk \"by end of June\" is a \"burst-build\" target. Here is the key quote: \"By having a Model 3 subsystem burst-build requirement of 6k by the end of June, we will lay the groundwork for achieving a steady 6k/week across the whole Model 3 system a few months later.\" This implies that Musk doesn't believe this number is something they will be able to maintain so I assume that Tesla will not get close to that number on any consistent basis in Q2. Last week of June: 6000. (assuming they hit the target once to be able to report it in the quarterly report, and alleviate the concerns on Wall Street). This is an optimistic assumption. Musk said that the reason for the 6k target is to offer a margin of error and increase the likelihood they meet the 5k official target. Total by 1 July: 49k. Alternative assumptions (all assume a second closure the last week of May):  Alternative 1) if we instead assume the May-June rate is 3k as the lower bound of Musk's estimate and we assume they hit 5k end June instead of 6k, we get 45k. Alternative 2) what we may consider as a more pessimistic scenario is the factory coming back online at the pre-closure rate of 2250 and stays there until end of Q2. Result: 37k. Alternative 3) A very pessimistic case: Goldman Sachs assumed (before the closure, so this is now outdated but here is the reference from my earlier comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/721823) a rate of 1400. Result: 29k.  On the whole, I lean toward 43-50 and 36-43 because Tesla has a lot riding on this and is taking concerted action to at least get close to its 5k target, and my assumption is that it will be at least to some extent successful."], [15471, "2018-04-18T19:50:04Z", [0.1, 0.37, 0.5, 0.03, 0.0], "Confirmed numbers:\n- produced until 1st April: 12.5k\n- production rate beginning of April: 2k/week There are 13 weeks between 1st April and 1st July, assuming the 2k/week as a sustained rate this would leave us with 12.5k + 26k = 38.5k model 3 at the 1st of July. Facts that reduce the estimate:\n- production has been halted for a week, leaving only 12 weeks (assuming everything goes as planned)\n- 2k/week was probably achieved over only a short period of time\n- numbers given here are production numbers, but question asks for deliveries Facts that increase the estimate:\n- production actually ramps up (2.5k 2017Q4, 10k 2018Q1, same increase would mean 40k 2018Q2)\n- Elon seems to have gotten that automatisation for automatisation sake does not necessarily mean higher output 40k/quarter corresponds to a sustained 3.1k/week, which is not too far away from the target 5k/week, so they probably won't be able to reach 40k in Q2. So if nothing bad happens they can produce 30k model 3 in Q2, which brings the total close to the 43k bracket. But due to the in-flight time and everything must work out requirements I'm giving it 3%.\nSo assuming they can start back at 2k/week after coming online again and they will linearly reach the 3k/week at the end of Q2, they would produce 25-30k. I actually think this is achievable, as it is well below the design capacity of the plant and they do seem to have  their logistic set up for that target. This would give a total of 40-45k cars produced but with a delivery time of maybe 7 days we end up at around 36k.
