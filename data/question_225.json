The Democratic nominee paid a net $27,000 for 96 spots in a one-week period, while her Republican rival was charged the same amount for 83 spots. . . . a review of dozens of FCC filings revealed a pattern of the Trump campaign paying initially higher rates in battleground states than the Clinton campaign because of its tendency to book closer to air dates.\n. . . \n\"Given the fluidity of TV ad pricing, the Trump campaign sometimes will receive rebates from the stations. Other times, the Clinton campaign, which reserved $80 million in fall airtime in mid-August, will choose to pay more later to ensure their ads air in competitive markets. Larger stations tend to send rebates before the ads air, but smaller stations\u2014such as WBBH\u2014often settle their books after the fact, sometimes as late as after Election Day.\n. . . \n\"The Trump campaign said late last month it planned to spend $100 million on TV ads in the final weeks of the election. But it so far has booked about half that, with less than four weeks until Election Day. \" . . . [Clinton's] super PAC . . .  has close to $40 million in airtime booked in the final weeks before the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s super PACs have booked a fraction of that. \"Since Mr. Trump\u2019s TV ads have lagged so far behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, some booking experts said, she has greater flexibility in choosing which ads she wants to pay a higher rate to have clear, and which she can allow to be bumped to less desirable times. \"Mr. Trump and his allied super PACs spent $78 million on TV ads through September, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. Mrs. Clinton and her allied groups spent $325 million.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.thetrace.org/2016/10/nra-breaks-campaign-spending-record/ \"The National Rifle Association has spent more money trying to elect Donald Trump president and maintain Republican control of Congress than it has on any other election in history.  As of Tuesday, the NRA had poured $36.3 million into the 2016 election, breaking its own record of $31.7 million from just two years before, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Almost all of that money is devoted to independent expenditures, a bucket term for fliers, postcards, and television advertisements supporting or opposing candidates in federal elections, but not given directly to a campaign.\n. . . \n\"The increased allocations come mostly on the presidential race. Through October 11, the NRA had spent $12 million attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and $9.6 million backing Trump. That\u2019s far more than the $13.6 million the group spent on the entire 2012 presidential race.\n. . . \n\"In down-ballot races, the group has spent $4.5 million on the North Carolina Senate race, about 90 percent of that attacking Democrat Deborah Ross, who is in a tight contest with incumbent Republican Richard Burr. The group has spent more than $2 million on Ohio\u2019s Senate race, and between $1.5 million and $2 million on contested races in Nevada, Florida, Missouri, and Indiana. . . . In Wisconsin, it has spent less than $300,000 to back Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, who pollsters expect to lose to former Senator Russ Feingold. The NRA has spent nothing to support Kelly Ayotte, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, who has faced millions of dollars in negative ads hitting her for opposing the so-called Manchin-Toomey universal background check bill in 2013, along with other gun safety votes. The NRA has also stayed out of the Pennsylvania Senate race, where Republican Pat Toomey, coauthor of that background check bill, is receiving help from gun safety groups in his tough reelection fight. Similarly, the NRA has steered clear of Illinois, where Republican Senator Mark Kirk, who has often voted with Democrats on guns, appears headed for defeat against Representative Tammy Duckworth, who also backs stronger gun laws.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://elections.ap.org/content/ad-spending Trump reported to have spent $30m as of 10/8, which means he's spent $6.4m in the last week.  With 11 days to go that could mean $10m more.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  So, Trump's costs are up because he's making last minute ad buys, but he's still not spending very much.

It should be a no brainer given past campaigns expenses, right? But Trump has hinted he will self-fund his campaign. Maybe this question takes root on that. But most sources say he couldn't afford it even if he wanted. Or, if he could afford it, would he even want to? It's not as if he were Bloomberg (worth $40B). There were reports last week that Trump was given a list of 30 top GOP donors to call and only called 3 before quitting (NY Post). Then he appeared along Reince Preibus in both New York City and Texas in successful fundraising events.  So this question might be about:  1) Trump's willingness to go along with the status quo or his actual ability to raise campaign funds (a known dealbreaker for any candidate at any level). \n2) Concerns that the RNC isn't doing enough to help Trump financially. The NYT said this week that the RNC recently formed TWO joint fundrasing committees and that they have been instructing their largest donors on \"how they can minimize or zero out the amount of their cash going to Trump.\"  Some pro-Trump Super PACs, according to the NYT, have told wealthy Republicans that if they want to help Trump, giving to the RNC isn't enough.   Can Trump and the RNC get it together to raise enough money or is it already looking challenging? Note that a chunk of campaign money comes from what the candidate himself raises, then the party, then how much Super Pacs invest. Good illustration here: http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance ) Interestingly, and as reported also by the NY Times this week, when Trump toyed around with an independent run in 2000, he said: \"It's very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.\"  He could end up turning a profit if he repaid himself for the campaign loans!    Same NYT article said that:  \"...the extent to which Mr. Trump was utilizing his own businesses for his run was unprecedented and that because of his unique financial circumstances, he was wading into territory that went beyond the FEC's guidance.\" Here is Trump's full FEC filing http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/514/201606209018595514/201606209018595514.pdf  But all that seems to me as more of a general strategy for the primary campaign which he ran so successfully. \nI would think that Trump will just fall in line with the RNC and the party's traditional fundraising efforts and campaigning. You can already see signs of that this week. The day after Lewandowski gets fired, Trump gives a speech in a completely different tone, \"savaging\" Hillary. It has RNC strategies stamps all over.  Trump himself, in addressing the firing of Lewandowski said that the campaign is now moving on a different direction. Lewandowski was the \"genius\" behind \"let Trump be Trump\" which got the candidate where he is now. As the nominee, Trump's strategy (in which he raised so little and spent so little in comparison) is not going to work as well as it did in the primary. The campaign is now taking a different direction and he will need as much money as he can raise. Releasing Lewandowski is a clear a signal of a switch in strategy and the GOP taking over as there ever will be.  This is from the 2012 race and can give us an idea of where money comes from: http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/campaign-finance"], [532, "2016-06-24T19:28:41Z", [0.03, 0.01, 0.35, 0.47, 0.14], ""], [706, "2016-06-24T17:56:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.89, 0.11, 0.0], "As an Independent!"], [22264, "2016-06-24T16:17:08Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [691, "2016-06-24T15:59:23Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.26, 0.62, 0.1], ""], [241, "2016-06-24T11:26:53Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.2], ""], [4729, "2016-06-24T03:46:32Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-06-24T00:02:13Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [241, "2016-06-23T23:48:02Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.15, 0.5, 0.3], ""], [5001, "2016-06-23T22:44:22Z", [0.05, 0.02, 0.35, 0.35, 0.23], ""], [23006, "2016-06-23T21:39:30Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.26, 0.2, 0.03], ""], [26132, "2016-06-23T21:33:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [15371, "2016-06-23T19:31:57Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.53, 0.02, 0.0], "Republican estab and donors don't want him elected.
