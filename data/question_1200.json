India second...\u2028A strong top-order pair, the formidable MS Dhoni factor in the middle-order and a daunting seam-bowling attack are what brings pride to the Indian cricket team. However, their inability to yet specify the No.4 batsman along with their middle-order conundrum in the recent past keep the Indians at the second spot.

England\u2019s standing as the outright favorites on the futures list is backed by the fact that June 2017 marks the nation\u2019s last ODI series defeat.\nFlat pitches, which provide lower levels of bounce and lateral motion, are where England thrive best, with those types of surfaces affording them greater license to focus on their main game plan, which is to outscore the opposition. India (+300)\nDespite losing the crown in 2015, India has gone from strength to strength. In the build-up to this World Cup in England, they have beaten every major rival in at least one series. Although 2019 has brought mixed results for the Indian team, they boast one of the best captains around with\u00a0Virat\u00a0Kohli\u00a0on course to break several international records.\nIndia stands as\u00a0second\u00a0favorites\u00a0to England in the long list, but not by a considerable distance.
