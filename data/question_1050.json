The price seems to have already been lowered to account for the post-IPO decline in Lyft.   You would expect a lower IPO price to be followed by a larger bounce on the first day of trading.  The drivers went on a short-term 2- to 24-hour  strike (depending on driver) this week for a living wage--some are not even making minimum wage.   Thus, drivers could unionize, new laws could make them employees, etc.  I am sure investors are sure there is a good chance Uber's labor costs will increase.  Uber's gross revenue has gone from $3.5 billion to $9.2 billion in two years.  Currently it has EBITDA of -$1.8 billion and net income of $997 million.   The yield curve went inverted this week.  A lot of people watch this indicator these days, including potential investors.  The DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all declined this week due to Trump's Chinese tariff threat.  This adds some volatility.  If the stock-buying public decides the threat is over-stated, the IPO price could get a Friday bump in a rising market.  If the stock-buying public decides otherwise, the IPO price could decline.  Often, there is a initial spike in the price followed a fall back to earth.  Thus, the time of  day that the stock is put in circulation could also make a difference.   The real issue is right now how much volatility is in the stock.   It will be offered at $82.5 billion.  I tried to find first day trading ranges for a number of dot.com IPOs but ran out of time.   82.5 is 17.5 less than 100 and 12.5 greater than 70.  Thus, a 21 % increase would be needed to push it to the next higher bracket but only a %15 decrease is needed to drop it into the next lower bracket.  The value of the stock was lowered to bottom part of the IPO offer range.  Hence, the lowered price already accounts for some of the downside risk but also indicates a loss of confidence by the underwriter.  On balance, I think there is little chance of a greater than 100 valuation at the end of the day.

Summary: from today's announced Uber offer price, the stock would have to rise ~18% to breach $100 bill. valuation. That seems less than 50% likely from historical base rate data but a number of Inside View factors suggest that's an underestimate. ~~~\nBase rate:\n~~~ IPOs are notoriously hard to analyze because of lack of data. So I look at how past IPOs performed on the first day of trading. This paper estimated first day returns (between closing price and offer price) from a sample of 1,887 US IPOs [1] (caveat - sample contains many stocks from the internet bubble). Median first-day return was 13%, mean 35% (distribution skewed to the right) with SD of 65%.  Raises the question: what is Uber's offer price going to be? From today: \"Uber plans to offer its shares to investors for $44 to $50 each, putting its total valuation between $80 billion and $90 billion\" [4].  If we assume an $85 bill. valuation implied by the offer price, the share price would have to rise 18% on the first trading day to breach $100 bill. valuation. The data above suggests that happens in less than half the cases. I have to wrap this up now but will estimate the percentage in the next post. Other data confirms top-level finding above: \n-This paper [1] features data from 311 IPOs between 1996 and 1997. It estimates first-day return. The median is 5.9% (25th percentile is 0 and 75th percentile is 17.5). Suggesting a lower likelihood of >18% returns (25%)\n-This paper [6] with ~200 IPOs estimated a median first-day return of 4% and an SD of 5.6% ~~~\nInside view:\n~~~ Three factors point to a higher possible first day performance.\n-Uber Is trying to avoid what happened to Lyft and is therefore likely pricing its offer price conservatively suggesting a bigger potential rise than expected by the historical data.\n-Uber Is making sure the lock-up provisions in its IPO will keep employees and other early holders from dumping [5]\n-Paypal is buying in to Uber with $0.5 bill, which could encourage others to have more confidence in the stock [6, 3] Other:\n-unknown unknowns: factors I haven't yet considered. To watch:\n-Uber's road show will give some indication of how much positive or negative sentiment there is around the IPO.\n-Any news on Uber's offer price.

According to all the news (and Uber hasn't denied it), they filed their S-1 form with the SEC in the week of 3-7 Dec 2018. I tried to find other reasons to file an S-1 other than going public, but I wasn't able to find any. I wasn't able to find any examples of companies that filed an S-1 but did not subsequently IPO --- maybe I didn't Google the right things. It would be interesting to hear from someone who knows more here. Then I looked through past intervals between S-1 filings and IPOs, for tech companies specifically --- both recent IPOs, and big IPOs. Thus I found that, of 10 companies: * 6 had 30 or fewer days between S-1 and IPO\n   Snap in 2017; SolarWinds, Anaplan, Dropbox, Eventbrite, DocuSign in 2018;\n* Tencent Music took 70 days in 2018;\n* Facebook took 107 days in 2012;\n* Google took 112 days in 2004;\n* Alibaba took 136 days in 2014. There have been ~25 non-govt-shutdown days since the S-1, and there are ~230 days between now and 1 Oct 2019, plus the . So it seems all but certain that Uber will IPO before then, say 6% chance it doesn't --- 5% chance for not IPOing at all (because of, to me, \"unknown unknowns\"), and 1% for it getting very delayed. The question now is, what will be the market cap. Apparently Uber was last (implicitly) valued at ~$75B by Toyota in Aug 2018, when it invested $500M in it [1]. So it seems unlikely that the IPO price will be less than that --- otherwise, wouldn't Toyota just wait for it? Let's call <$70B a 10% chance, and $40B a 0% --- I think they'd sooner give up on IPOing than fetch such a small amount. The other number that is floating around these days is $120B, which you can find mentioned in many news sources. However, people more familiar with the matter seem to think that's high [2]. Some other people seem to think $90B is more plausible due to \"stock market slump\" [3], but that article is from early Jan 2019, and the S&P500 is ~12% higher now than it was then, so if we do a simple linear extrapolation we get $100B. All in all it seems to make the >$130B bucket unlikely. But Uber is a household name; could enough retail investors buy to cause a significant rise in the price? According to a few minutes of Googling, retail investors own anywhere between 5% and 20% of all stocks. Since the stock market is valued at ~$30T-$40T, that means retail investors have conservatively $1.5T invested. So if 10% of them put 10% of what they have on Uber, that's over $15B, which seems like enough to move the price. But, will retail investors massively act on IPO day? Intuitively it seems like most wouldn't even know the exact date. All in all I want to call >$130B a 10% chance. That leaves 74% to split between the $70B-$100B and $100B-$130B ranges; I don't know enough to tell them apart, especially since it seems like around ~$100B is a plausible value. So I'll just give them both equal odds, 37%.

Some thoughts below. \"Khosrowshahi appears to be on track to keep his word about taking Uber public within 18 to 36 months of joining the company in August 2017.\"[1] Taking Mr. K at his word, this window is open from now until August 2020. Using an 18-month time frame and assuming an even probability distribution, that is about 100% / 18 months = ~5.5% per month with the probability accumulating cumulatively for each month they don't list. This means that by the closing date of the question the probability of Uber listing is ~ 44%. However, I think the chance of this happening sooner rather than later skews the base calculation. \"Washington hijinks are unlikely to derail the ride-hailing giants\u2019 march toward IPO. That\u2019s partly because [Uber and Lyft] need a steady stream of investor cash to keep operating. If they didn\u2019t list, they would probably need to tap the private markets again. Another key reason for Uber is that, when it raised money from SoftBank last year, the company agreed to free up some shareholders to sell on the private markets if it didn\u2019t go public in 2019. That\u2019s a situation the startup probably wants to avoid. And finally, the jockeying between Uber and Lyft only ups the competitive pressure for each to list before the other sucks up all the oxygen and investor money.[2] Right now, my probabilities are 67% for a listing / 33% against by the closing date of this question. I can't really justify any adjustments at the moment.

A well-run roadshow could see a large run-up in the share price on the day of the IPO.  It could see a lift of 20%, 30% or more at market close, on top of pricing at the high end of the range.  A poorly run IPO could see a fall in the price.   Manhattan Venture Partners, an IPO research firm, assigns a fair market value of $52 billion to Uber, partly based on its 17.5% equity stake in Chinese ride sharing-service Didi Chuxing.  https://mvp.vc/researched-company/uber-pre-ipo-research-report/ Toyota's investment in Uber valued the company at $72 billion, and an earlier round valued it at $62 billion.  So anything above $80 billion would leave those investors not unhappy.  The bankers reportedly envision a $120 billion valuation.   As I mentioned, a well-run roadshow could see the IPO price there and run up to $150 billion or $160 billion or higher.  Some consideration should be given to that possibility.   On the other hand.... It's two days before Christmas 2018.  The market has declined 18 percent from its high and is poised on the precipice of a bear market.  No one knows whether a recession has arrived much sooner than anyone expected.  The bankers would be fully justified in going out with a valuation today of 20% less, or $96 billion.  By the time the IPO occurs, the market could be even lower, and a poorly run IPO could lead to a Manhattan Venture Partners-type valuation of $52 billion, with the end-of-day wildcard taking it below $40 billion.

The question asks what the market cap will be at end of trading. I therefore took into account both opening price and first-day trading activity. Since this is the most anticipated IPO of 2019, it's going to have a lot of investor interest and likely will open above the IPO price and will trade on huge volumes the first day. Best Nasdaq IPO 1-day performers in 2018 averaged close to 100% above IPO price. I suspect  the underwriters will want to be a little conservative so that some investors ca take first day profits on the hype. In addition, we should see lots of volume early on as investors try to get in, driving up the 1st day price. While a 100% increase over IPO prices seems unlikely, some of the best tech performers of 2018 saw 33% 1-day returns and they were no where near the hype Uber is getting. If the underwriters price the stock at $100 billion, it doesn't seem unreasonable for 1st-day close to be at 50% above that ($150 billion). I'm not talking about sustainable prices, I'm just talking about 1st day hype and valuation at the close. Given the current uncertainties in the overall market and signs of softening, investors might see it as a particularly appetizing IPO (irrational but not unexpected) and drive price up. This seems the most likely scenario. Given the broad valuation range, I'll stick with $100 billion for now and assume a 50% pop as most likely (60%), with 35% at $100-$130, assuming a more tepid response. There is a possibility that investors won't like Uber's performance to date and, if the market sags substantially, they could decide to wait, but given the hype I see this is only a slightly non-trivial probability (5%)."], [31756, "2018-12-15T12:13:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3], ""], [26551, "2018-12-15T11:01:51Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [31505, "2018-12-15T07:14:48Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3], ""], [15119, "2018-12-15T06:15:32Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.55, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-15T04:22:48Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.35, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [12335, "2018-12-15T03:17:05Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [49359, "2018-12-15T00:14:55Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.6, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [691, "2018-12-14T21:23:00Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.48, 0.43, 0.01, 0.02], ""], [61602, "2018-12-14T21:14:59Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.24, 0.21, 0.02, 0.03], ""], [63092, "2018-12-14T19:37:08Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [63092, "2018-12-14T19:33:02Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Current Valuation is $74b but market headwind may move valuation as get closer to IPO"], [62980, "2018-12-14T14:20:28Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-14T12:16:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.35, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [36147, "2018-12-14T09:47:53Z", [0.03, 0.1, 0.28, 0.09, 0.11, 0.39], ""], [46575, "2018-12-14T07:50:38Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1], "Based on the 120bn estimate and the discounts applied to the other big ipos mentioned "], [63543, "2018-12-14T07:45:32Z", [0.15, 0.6, 0.2, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [42417, "2018-12-14T03:56:08Z", [0.05, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [14912, "2018-12-14T02:59:04Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1], ""], [63587, "2018-12-14T01:14:22Z", [0.01, 0.05, 0.24, 0.45, 0.2, 0.05], "Paperwork went out this week.

Hubert Horan has posted an excellent analysis of the firm here: http://horanaviation.com/Uber.html The bottom line is that Uber continues to highly subsidize rides for users, using investor funds. There are few economies of scale to leverage by expanding the user base (which is a large part of the reason why the taxi industry has not consolidated) and there are next to no network effects to take advantage of as is the case with social media platforms. The only way their valuation makes sense is if you believe they will become THE dominant player in the autonomous driving space, which will be challenging given the number of competitors currently rushing to market and the fact that the product itself appears years away. In addition, becoming an autonomous car platform would significantly increase Uber's capital expenditure, further increasing its already prodigious cash burn.  That being said, public markets can be irrational in the short to medium term, so it is entirely possible that Uber's IPO will succeed. Uber will likely not proceed with an IPO if valuations fall short of expectations - I doubt they will go forward unless they achieve a valuation higher than their last funding round of $72bn.  There are external factors to consider as well - if the current downturn were to accelerate, it is unlikely that Uber would IPO into a weak equity market.

However,$2.7 billion in revenue was not enough for Uber to turn a profit, posting a $400 million loss.\nhttps://medium.com/makingofamillionaire/uber-seeks-120-billion-valuation-e3515df5efff Facebook was valued at $104 billion during its IPO IN 2012\nUber\u2019s primary competitor, Lyft is valued at $15 billion\nFord is currently valued at $37 billion\nTesla is currently valued at $58 billion Uber is currently valued at 76 billion.\nhttps://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/uber-files-papers-for-wall-street-debut/news-story/a44c72a21705a858bd9e77e6c9b2a4a3?nk=be81337a1b50f1b23e8ed6d3552e3345-1544339804\n"], [27155, "2018-12-09T04:02:59Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05, 0.25], ""], [63470, "2018-12-08T23:07:34Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.45, 0.32, 0.05, 0.15], ""], [37368, "2018-12-08T23:05:26Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.33, 0.32, 0.1, 0.16], "Based on @cmeinel link to Bloomberg.
