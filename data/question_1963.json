These clinical trials can take several months to complete before a New Drug Application (NDA) is filed with the FDA. The process for qualifying candidates for phase III trials has been quite slow as the criteria are strict. Qualification for the administration of the experimental drug is primarily dependent on vaccination status, time elapsed after receiving full vaccination, and risk factor for patients (with high risk individuals being preferred for trials). Before being approved, the FDA must also review and approve the NDA which can take up to 60 days for the paperwork and filing to be complete. Early testing has proven molnupiravir to be effective at combatting moderate cases of Covid-19, meaning the likelihood of it eventually being approved is relatively high; however the October 1st deadline for FDA approval is simply unattainable.  https://www.drugwatch.com/fda/approval-process/\nhttps://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/molnupiravir-market/\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04405739"], [98789, "2021-09-29T19:46:39Z", [0.0], ""], [102399, "2021-09-29T17:33:57Z", [0.0], "The news make it look as if molnupiravir is still months away from being approved."], [102403, "2021-09-29T15:00:27Z", [0.0], ""], [95683, "2021-09-29T02:17:53Z", [0.0], ""], [96392, "2021-09-29T01:51:15Z", [0.0], ""], [49838, "2021-09-28T23:19:17Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-28T21:26:01Z", [0.0], ""], [80590, "2021-09-28T13:17:25Z", [0.0], ""], [67312, "2021-09-28T13:10:14Z", [0.0], ""], [95683, "2021-09-28T02:22:19Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-27T20:27:16Z", [0.0], ""], [102121, "2021-09-27T19:04:42Z", [0.0], "It seems very unlikely that the US FDA will approve molnupiravir for use to treat COVID-19 before 1 October 2021 given that (i) molnupiravir comes with the possibility of side effects that could mean the drug is only approved for emergency use for specific subgroups of the population (https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/analysis/molnupiravir-market/) but (ii) phase III trials are expected to end only in November with further analysis of the results taking place later, esp. with respect to population subgroups (https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/molnupiravir-trial-enrolment/)."], [31275, "2021-09-27T15:21:04Z", [0.0], ""], [58508, "2021-09-27T14:37:38Z", [0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-09-27T07:55:04Z", [0.16], ""], [95683, "2021-09-27T02:22:23Z", [0.0], ""], [95683, "2021-09-26T20:34:22Z", [0.0], ""], [79461, "2021-09-25T17:00:18Z", [0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-09-25T14:48:06Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2021-09-25T05:23:12Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2021-09-25T01:53:33Z", [0.0], ""], [80662, "2021-09-25T00:05:11Z", [0.0], "Trials must be really slow to get going.

Remdesivir, a different anti-viral that was already approved, started Phase III in March 2020 and completed trials in June 2020 [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT0429273]. However, it wasn't approved by the FDA until October 2020 (still very fast compared to non-emergency approvals). Remdesivir had already undergone trials in 2009 for Hepatitis C (and didn't work) but was later approved for Ebola [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir] and Marburg virus. They also determined that it was effective against coronaviruses [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338263/] in 2017. If Remdesivir was representative, one might expect Molnupiravir to complete Phase III trials within 4 months. After Phase III, Remdesivir took another 5 months to be approved with emergency use for COVID-19. Assuming Molnupiravir does get approved, a similar timeline would have Phase III trials completing around September 2021, and for the purposes of this question, would leave only one month for the final FDA approval. Remdesivir had already undergone several trials since 2009. Molnupiravir was also used as a preventative for SARS-CoV and MERS in the early 2000s, so its historical data there may also be helpful. So my main uncertainty is whether Molnupiravir (1) is found to be effective and of value in outpatient therapy. I would place the probability at 85%. And (2) whether it can be approved within a month of Phase III results. For comparison, the Pfizer/Biontech Phase III trials concluded on November 18, 2020, and the emergency use authorization by the FDA was issued in December 11, 2020. Moderna was approved in a slightly shorter amount of time. This is the most optimistic timeline I could find, in contrast - fast approval times in all other circumstances range from 150 days to 300 days [https://www.pharmexec.com/view/how-fast-are-fda-fast-lanes]. Maybe due to a lack of imagination, it doesn't seem realistic to me that Molnupiravir would be approved any faster than our two exceptionally miraculous COVID-19 vaccines. It's pretty significant, too, that Moderna and Pfizer were approved at the beginning of winter, just 4-5 weeks months prior to peak COVID-19 daily cases. Meaning there was extreme pressure to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use ahead of a predictably horrific and deadly winter season. Daily cases at that time had reached 251,000 and were averaging 220,000+ (and later reached 300,000 on January 8th). Today we are well below the July 2020 and January 2021 peaks at 30,000+ daily new cases instead of 220,000+ when the vaccines were approved. It's a horrible disease, but thanks to the vaccines, the summer season approaching, and the 8-fold decrease in new cases there is no longer the same urgency as there was at the end of December 2020. For that reason, I would estimate that unless Molnupiravir has miraculous efficacy, it would not be approved sooner than December 2021, and if consistent with Remdesivir's timeline, not before February 2022. Using timeline constraints, the earliest feasible approval (under extreme circumstances) looks like late September and an estimated \"late approval\" (if approved) could be as late as April 2022. That results in, optimistically, 15 days of the affirmative scenario (approval before October 1st), and 182 days of the alternative. 15 / (15 + 182) = 7% chance (conditioned on approval) of approval before October 1st, 2021. 7% * 85% = 6%. I think 6% is still way too optimistic and will aggressively reduce my estimate as time progresses. Side note: trials are underway in India as well. The urgency of emergency approval might diminish in the United States due to reduced new cases, but a successful Molnupiravir would obviously save a significant number of lives around the world."], [88452, "2021-05-20T12:17:40Z", [0.75], "https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/qa-with-university-of-alberta-professor-whose-lab-uncovered-how-an-oral-drug-attacks-the-covid-19-virus"], [1333, "2021-05-20T10:43:23Z", [0.04], ""], [34959, "2021-05-20T04:21:18Z", [0.08], ""], [55987, "2021-05-18T16:43:59Z", [0.04], ""], [100828, "2021-05-18T08:55:02Z", [0.55], ""], [58028, "2021-05-17T12:38:39Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2021-05-16T12:26:33Z", [0.1], ""], [97140, "2021-05-16T10:38:10Z", [0.05], ""], [94872, "2021-05-16T05:48:10Z", [0.21], ""], [21278, "2021-05-15T19:46:08Z", [0.1], ""], [95503, "2021-05-14T10:12:15Z", [0.17], ""], [34815, "2021-05-14T05:00:27Z", [0.0], ""], [11335, "2021-05-13T13:56:12Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-05-12T22:38:04Z", [0.06], ""], [691, "2021-05-12T17:05:43Z", [0.12], ""], [100990, "2021-05-12T12:38:14Z", [0.69], ""], [88452, "2021-05-12T11:27:51Z", [0.75], "https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_2328\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_642\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-plan-to-beat-coronavirus-variants-more-and-better-vaccines/ [re: HERA/EU Fab project]"], [29054, "2021-05-11T23:41:10Z", [1.0], "It is on track for July latest on August.

These patients generally had a longer duration of symptoms prior to study entry.\" But testing in outpatients is proceeding to Phase 3. While it's becoming clear that this drug alone does not have a substantial impact on the clinical course of Covid in hospitalized patients, I am still very optimistic that this drug will likely be approved because I believe it is likely to have a substantial impact on disease progression in outpatients to whom it is administered early. \"Based on recommendations from an external data monitoring committee, the inclusion criteria for the phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT study will be updated to include patients with symptom duration of 5 days or less and at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease. Merck will begin enrolling patients in the phase 3 portion (Part 2) of the MOVe-OUT study by late April/early May of 2021 and expects to have study data available in September/October of 2021.\" My main question would be when it is approved. If early Phase 3 data show that it prevents progression to severe disease in patients with at least one risk factor, I think the drug would likely be given EUA before Oct. 1. If the data are equivocal or otherwise less exciting, then the process might drag out more easily past Oct. 1. Some here are concerned about toxicity. But other drugs of this class with similar toxicity profiles have been FDA approved for decades for the long-term treatment of chronic diseases. For example, ribavirin has been used for more than 2 decades in the treatment of HCV; see, e.g., https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/177792-treatment#d11 . In contrast, molnupiravir would be prescribed for a very short duration, perhaps a few weeks, in the treatment of Covid. I don't see toxicity as a barrier to getting FDA approval, especially if it is shown to prevent some level of morbidity or mortality from Covid.

Molnupiravir, an antiviral medication that is currently in clinical trials, may soon be added to the currently available tools to treat COVID-19.\nMolnupiravir is an antiviral that is different from the currently used remdesivir because unlike remdesivir, which is given via IV, molnupiravir can be taken orally. This means it will be much easier for doctors to prescribe to patients who are not hospitalized with COVID-19, and could be used in a similar fashion as the antiviral, Tamiflu.\n[...]\nThe first human clinical trial of the drug2 \u2013 a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial \u2013 was completed, testing the safety and effectiveness of this antiviral at multiple doses. The trial included 64 participants between the ages of 19 and 60.\nThe study reported that the antiviral was well tolerated and that there were no serious adverse events in people taking the medication. They also reported that the medication was able to be detected in the plasma of participants.\nThe drug is now in phase II and phase III clinical trials to test whether it is effective in patients who are hospitalized or not hospitalized with COVID-19. The trials will determine the effectiveness of molnupiravir in reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in participants \u2013 this will give an indication of whether it might be effective in reducing the spread of the virus from person to person.
