Rule of three doesn't work here since small sample size and one-off event.  It seems to be hard to argue for a base rate higher than 20% given this evidence. Concrete evidence regarding this year:\n- In March, Chinese markets seem to have reacted to announcements surrounding such a law. Stock prices of major Chinese property developers sank by more than 10%. [1] Apparently, this has happened before though. [3] \"[S]hares have largely recovered since.\" [6]\n- Apparently, even after drafting such a law (which they claim to want to do this year), passing such a law takes significant amounts of time: \"the process of drafting a law must go through several readings in the Chinese legislature, before it goes for public feedback.\" [2] No concrete draft has yet surfaced.\n- I also found this \"The best guess is that legislation will be in place by 2023 when the current legislature ends its term, before the enactment of the levy follows, according to a report by Citic Securities.\" [2] Similar sentiment expressed here [4]. Assuming uniform probability over that time, we get between 10% to 15% for the time before October 1. I'd assume it's skewed toward the end though.\n- This guy with a vested interest says it won't happen now. [5] I have a hard time seeing that this will happen with more than 12% probability.

Recently, Minsheng Securities released a report saying that the central government\u2019s expression of \u201cfull authorization\u201d and \u201cstreet policy\u201d for real estate tax means that the central government\u2019s legislation on real estate tax is more to solve the legal problem of this tax, and on the specific expropriation rules. The local government will be given sufficient authority to select specific levy time, applicable tax rate, and object of collection. The report believes that in the future, the scope of real estate tax collection will be promoted from the first-line and hot-spot second-tier cities to gradually expand the pilot, and the third- and fourth-tier cities will set a higher exempted area, with less or no receipt, the same city. A pattern of gradual expansion from the main urban area to the suburbs.\" My reading of this is that the property tax law is not about implementation. It is about setting the legal framework for starting the process of implementing a real estate tax. They'll roll it out in a few major cities first where speculation is particularly a problem, try to tighten down the technical problem of determining housing prices, and they will iron out the details and gradually roll this out everywhere. i think the current economic environment is largely irrelevant, since this will clearly be a multi-year process. I'm still inclined to think that they'll pass some kind of legal framework for levying real estate taxes this year, but I'm going to come down a bit, say 70%.

While the housing sector is one of China\u2019s main pillars of growth, the market frenzy led to talk of using property tax to curb speculation in 2016.  The immediate implementation of the tax was not possible because creating and implementing a modern property tax system from the scratch is not straightforward [https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/edward-cheung-on-chinas-modern-property-tax-system/].  Furthermore, the infrastructure needed, such as a national database of land-ownership, was not there.   By 2017, the database has been created.  By midyear 2018, there were many news reports suggesting the imminent implementation of a property tax in China.  However, this is eclipsed by the sudden start of the trade war between China and the U.S.  Due to the trade war and the associated uncertainties, the housing market has cooled down.  It is accompanied by a slowdown of the economy.
