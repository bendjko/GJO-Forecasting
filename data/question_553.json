After all, his statement after the incident was tepid at best (https://edforvirginia.com/2017/08/12/gillespie-statement-events-charlottesville/), and failed to condemn white supremacy movements or reiterate his support for maintaining Confederate monuments (in short, failing to take a stand one way or the other). Looking at the 2013 election results (http://www.politico.com/2013-election/results/governor/virginia/), I think it's likely Northam will win Northern VA (DC suburbs), Southeastern VA (Norfolk area), and Richmond, which are the largest population centers in the state. For Gillespie to have a chance, he needs those areas to be close, winning at least one of the NOVA or Norfolk area counties, while significantly running up the margins in the more rural counties. I think it will likely be Northam, and likely by less than 5%, given previous results.

In fact, in 2016 the Republican presidential candidate received a fewer % of votes than any other Republican presidential candidate in over 50 years. This indicates a general shift towards Democrat in the state.  However, comparing presidential election results to governor election results at similar times reveals that there is a lack of correlation between the party that Virginia votes for in presidential elections and the party affiliation of their choice of Governor. Thus, other factors besides party affiliation appear more important to the electorate of Virginia in voting for their Governor. One factor that often impacts a candidate's success is whether they are local to the area. Although more Governors of Virginia have been from somewhere in Virginia, the most recent Governors have not been. So, whilst Ralph Northam's connections to Virginia are unlikely to harm his chances, it is also unlikely that it will win him the election.  Nonetheless, I believe that Ralph Northam is more likely to be elected Governor of Virginia for the following reasons: 1. He has already held positions in Virginia: the people of Virginia have already voted for him multiple times (most recently in 2014), so he clearly has backing in the area. This also means that him and his campaign team have experience and knowledge of campaigning in Virginia - no doubt useful. He has achieved over 55% of the vote in the past, but evidence that the USA has become more partisan makes this less likely.\n2. The recent events in Charlottesville will undoubtedly affect the election. The way each candidate responds will alienate at least some voters. By condemning white supremacy, Ralph Northam will only alienate those voters who would never vote Democrat anyway. On the other hand, Ed Gillespie can either choose to condemn white supremacy (which will alienate a section of the core Republican vote), or choose to not condemn white supremacy (which will alienate potential swing voters of a moderate political persuasion). \n3. The general trend towards Democrat in the area combined with very low approval ratings of Donald Trump makes being affiliated with the Republicans electorally inhibiting.\n4. Ralph Northam is the type of Democrat likely to appeal to typically Republican voters. He was in the army and is quite fiscally conservative.
