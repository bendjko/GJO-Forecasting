Does this feature of the motion support or oppose this goal: \"It also urges the Rouhani administration to safeguard Iran\u2019s classified military and security information and prohibit any type of IAEA access to the country\u2019s military sites under the pretext of implementing the nuclear deal.\"  Now how can inspectors search for a secret nuclear weapons program if they are banned from \"any type of IAEA access to the country's military sites...\"? I'm guessing the resolution of this question will be heavily driven by the political biases of the scorers. There was considerable conflict in this game over the Parchin inspection on the grounds that Iranian officials did the inspection under the direction of IAEA rather than independently. So this suggests a bias among the scorers toward deciding that either the nuclear deal will be adhered to without any inspections of military facilities, or else that this clause doesn't mean anything.

Source: Dateline 9-28-15 Al-Monitor sat down with former Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi to get a sense of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s very good that parliament is becoming involved in the serious issues that our country faces, and there is no problem with this. But exactly how parliament plans to do this, and whether it wants to discuss details or generalities, are things that we have to wait to see,\u201d said Asefi. He qualified his comments and said, \u201cIn the end, though, I don\u2019t think parliament will involve itself in the ratification or rejection of the JCPOA, since doing so will have serious consequences.\u201d Indeed, what has stirred debate more than the potential outcome of the commission\u2019s \u201creview\u201d is the presence of former nuclear negotiators in its sessions. Saeed Jalili, a conservative who ran in the 2013 presidential election, was never required to answer questions in parliament when he led negotiations in 2007-13. Yet, these days, he and his team see it as their duty to provide answers. In a hard-hitting attack on the nuclear deal before the commission, Jalili outlined what he called 100 \u201cviolations\u201d of Iran\u2019s \u201crights.\u201d Despite the harsh language, this sort of opposition is not widely seen as a credible threat to the deal. According to Mehdi Motaharinia, a political analyst on international issues, \u201cThe presence of Jalili and the former negotiating team is only aimed at showing public opinion that they had also worked hard to make the nuclear file a success, and through their current presence [in the commission], they hope to distance themselves from their own failures.\u201d Behrouz Nemati, the former spokesman for parliament\u2019s presiding board, also echoes this sentiment. He told Al-Monitor, \u201cJalili\u2019s presence at the commission is like bringing the dead back to life, which is not possible. Jalili should instead answer as to why he destroyed all the opportunities that came up during the six years that he was in charge of the nuclear file, and why he did not bring the [2013] Almaty [Kazakhstan] talks to conclusion.\u201d But the story doesn\u2019t end here. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the establishment of this commission is the Rouhani administration's and the negotiating team\u2019s opposition to it. Asefi told Al-Monitor, \u201cWhat the negotiating team has said is that parliament should not ratify the JCPOA. But they never said that there should not be a commission to review the nuclear deal. They also said that parliament should not become involved in the ratification or rejection of the deal.\u201d Asefi added, \u201cThe reason that the president, the foreign minister and nuclear negotiating team say parliament should not ratify the deal is because no parliament in the P5+1 [Russia, China, Britain, France, United States and Germany] group of countries has done this. Therefore, there is no need for us to ratify the deal. Second, if we do take such a measure in parliament, it will then become law, and with it, bring obligations for the government and tie our hands. Therefore, it is better if this is not done.\u201d Read more: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/09/iran-jcpoa-review-commission.html#ixzz3nB9IKPZB\n"], [241, "2015-09-30T00:25:25Z", [0.75], ""], [1184, "2015-09-29T21:47:18Z", [0.59], ""], [368, "2015-09-29T19:30:48Z", [1.0], ""], [884, "2015-09-29T18:35:19Z", [1.0], ""], [3300, "2015-09-29T18:00:36Z", [0.99], ""], [73, "2015-09-29T17:42:19Z", [1.0], "update on time / news etc."], [854, "2015-09-29T17:39:32Z", [0.9], "The special JCPOA commission will apparently report to the parliament today, and concurrent with their report they are preparing a double-urgency bill for parliament concerning the implementation of the JCPOA [1].

I believe the vote is largely symbolic, intended to involve Iranian domestic politics in the negotiation in a way that mirrors the influence of US domestic politics through Congress. Nonetheless, I expect the vote to resolve in favor of the JCPOA. However, I have some question about the content of the double-urgency bill and whether its passage will constitute a \"yes\" for the purposes of this question. On September 21, Chairman of the Parliament\u2019s National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi said that Parliament would neither pass nor reject the JCPOA, but rather establish red-lines around its implementation [2].

Would such a vote on \"red-lines\" constitute \"approval\"? Overall, I am going to guess that it would, since the question doesn't use a more specific term like \"ratification\".

Overall, Iran already appears to be the most stable, educated, civilized and tolerant nation in the region.

Jews openly wear yarmulkes, even prayer shawls, in public. There even is a Jewish member of the Parliament. Given all of this, the end of sanctions can only make the nation more modern and less revolutionary.

As the current deal meets that condition, parliamentarians will be under some pressure to see it through. (2) All candidates for parliament must be approved by Iran's Guardian Council, which is selected by the Supreme Leader and the head of the judiciary. As a result, there is a strong incentive for current parliamentarians who wish to run in future elections to stay in alignment with the Ayatollah's general policy preferences; if they don't, they risk being disqualified. While Khamenei has yet to endorse the final deal (creating some uncertainty), I find it difficult to believe that he would let the process get this far and then torpedo it. As this Reuters article (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/15/us-iran-nuclear-setad-insight-idUSKCN0RF0E920150915) also points out, many of Khamenei's close supporters stand to benefit from the deal, increasing his incentive to see it pass.  (3) While there are a large number of hardliner members of parliament, I don't seem to be able to find a credible source nailing down an exact number (Iranian political affiliations seems to be quite fluid). However, very few news articles are suggesting that there are enough hardliners opposed to torpedo the deal (will update if I can find better info on this)."], [1016, "2015-09-15T18:38:13Z", [0.99], "Iran got the deal of a lifetime."], [975, "2015-09-15T16:48:00Z", [0.67], ""], [973, "2015-09-15T16:41:32Z", [0.92], ""], [369, "2015-09-15T15:50:29Z", [0.93], "with the potential opening of  numerous economic doors,  the perception of a diplomatic victory,  and  the probability of waiting for all others to move first, it seems almost a given "], [136, "2015-09-15T15:38:49Z", [0.6], ""], [493, "2015-09-15T13:10:58Z", [0.9], "Agree with Jatreit.

One cranky old hat stirring up anti-Western sentiment doesn't suddenly mean passage will fail. Just as the Congressional vote was (almost) assured from the start but allowed hard-liners to bare their teeth, so too are the latest comments coming from Iran. For reference, in the past week alone President Rouhani offered \"L'shana tova\" to Israel and SL Khameini denounced Israel and called us The Great Satan again. (Personally, it's my favorite nickname for the U.S.) I'm placing a lot of eggs in this basket between all the similar questions, but I reiterate my stance: Iran can, will and MUST pass this accord. Khameini has already rubber-stamped the deal or else it wouldn't exist in the first place, and now he simply has to reassure his allies with the usual rhetoric. As far as I see it, the ONLY question remaining is the timeline for approval. Iran's parliament was directed to wait at least 80 days from the JCPOA's inking, which comes due on October 9th. At least one (questionable) source has the vote coming as soon as this month. Based on these, I find the probability of passage before Nov 1st to be very high. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-vote.html\nhttp://en.trend.az/iran/politics/2431225.html"], [505, "2015-09-15T09:06:45Z", [0.95], "Both sides must make JCPA publically official"], [68, "2015-09-15T08:28:00Z", [0.9], "There will be a noisy debate but it will be approved.

Curiously too, the day after Congress passed the agreement, Iran announced a visit to China to discuss said agreement (also economic alliances).    Iran's parliament is made up of conservatives. It's leader, Larijani hedged recently when asked in a variety of recent stateside interviews (see Amanpour/CNN and Inskeep/NPR) whether JCPOA will \"pass\".  His view is that that Iran will not sign anything until sanctions are lifted. The U.S. has said sanctions can be lifted in as soon as six months (Jan).  Note too that as the JCPOA is right now the Rouhani sees it as a loose voluntary agreement without his signature. If it goes through Parliament it will become legally \"binding\" for Iran but not so for the other countries who signed it. Now members are scrutinizing the agreement that Rouhani left them out of when it was built. Khomeini isn't stepping in to get them to align right now (eventually he likely will whereas they likely will sign off on the agreement - but for now he's punishing Rouhani for his power hungry actions). Rouhani is trying hard to be relevant to maintain power well into the future. This weekend (during the time of the year which is a pause for reflection and repentance in the ME), Rouhani tweeted \"L'Shanah Tovah\" to Israel while blasting the Saudi's over crane incompetence.   Also note that many posts/predictions on the Rezaian question see his release soon. Parliament Chief Larijani's brother is the leader of Iran's judiciary wing. While the institutions the bros Larijani represent are separate, the two are said to be close kin. A Parliament wait on the JCPOA means a Judiciary wait on Rezaian. Oh, and first and most importantly, Khomeini needs to give his blessing on Rezaian before anything can happen.
