I understand Go to no longer be a candidate, yet he has not formally withdrawn his candidacy. Still, the odds seem ipso facto lower for him than for any of the formal frontrunners. Of the top four, each holds a position from which history seems to indicate it's at least possible for them to become president. Here's a few other considerations - Polling seems to provide at least some information in Philippine presidential elections if you look at the last couple elections. - Of 15 presidential transitions in Philippine history, only 1 president has handed over to a candidate of the same party. So that suggests a starting base rate for Pacquiao of about 6%, who is technically a member of PDP-Laban\u2014in fact, its president starting in 2020. But his presidency was disputed and it changed hands. Pacquiao's support is now around 15%, so I'll kick him up a bit to about 10% to start with. He is also one of the most famous boxers in the world, which I have to imagine is worth something- perhaps he's worth 15% after all. - President Duterte seems to be pretty popular overall, with estimates of his approval rating ranging from around 60% to around 90%. - If you look at the last few presidents, it looks like Arroyo had been the previous VP, as had Estrada. The sitting VP did not run in the 2010 election, but Jejomar Binay, the sitting VP, did, and lost. So of the past three presidential transitions in which a VP was a candidate in the election, two passed to that VP. That looks pretty good for Leni Robredo, the sitting VP, but 66% seems pretty damn confident, especially with her polling sitting around 15%. I'd kick her down to 40% to start with. - What about Isko Moreno? He is currently polling at around 23%, seemingly closing in on Marcos at about 25%. He is also the president of Aksyon Demokratiko, a relatively new political party that doesn't seem to have performed that well in previous national elections. He is popular as mayor. The Manila metro contains about a quarter of the population of the Philippines, but the city itself only has 1%. I don't see much of a reason to allocate more probability to him than his current share of the poll, so let's give him about 20%. - So. Bongbong Marcos. Friend of the president- per WIkipedia: \"President Rodrigo Duterte has stated several times that he would resign if Marcos would be his successor instead of Vice President Leni Robredo.\" On the face of it, this would suggest that Duterte's high approval and this implicit endorsement of Marcos should go together. And indeed, Marcos has been leading the polls, topping out at more than 50% in one recent poll. But it's early, and in another poll he's dipped down to about 25%. He is a senator and the son of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He has been in electoral politics in the Philippines for about 30 years. There's one big thing to know about him and Leni Robredo: they went head-to-head for the vice presidency in 2016 and he lost\u2014barely. So I'd give him about even odds to Robredo. That means we don't add up, with Robredo 40%, Marcos 40%, Moreno 20%, and Pacquiao 15%. My options are to scale everything down or to ask myself how wrong I'm likely to be in relative terms about any one or more of these candidates. It's also plausible that Go or another candidate could win; I'd like to give 1% to each possibility. I don't have a lot of other information right now, so I'll stake it here and normalize- Robredo 34, Marcos 34, Moreno 17, Pacquiao 13 -  - "], [103496, "2021-12-04T18:51:21Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [103495, "2021-12-04T18:05:41Z", [0.07, 0.25, 0.57, 0.11, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-12-04T16:03:41Z", [0.0, 0.68, 0.15, 0.1, 0.01, 0.06], ""], [103490, "2021-12-04T13:56:50Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.4, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-12-04T09:00:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.05, 0.12], ""], [92079, "2021-12-04T03:35:47Z", [0.11, 0.66, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-12-04T01:47:48Z", [0.22, 0.3, 0.1, 0.23, 0.1, 0.05], "Quick forecast before work.

I'm expecting the Duterte kid to change her mind and stand for Prez instead of VP.  In that case, she wins.  I think this is technically illegal, a consideration which has never weighed heavily with either the Duterte or the Marcos clan.  If she stays in the VP slot with BongBong, it will be tough to beat them.   Philippine politics has always been tough to predict, though, so I'm probably wrong.   The continued political viability of the Marcos gang continues to bemuse.  I lived in the Philippines sixty years ago when BongBong's daddy was an up-and-comer, and even then lots of people were already tired of the family.  Still, the US harbours a lot of rabid fans of a truly dreadful former Prez, so clearly it happens.   BongBong is an easy name to make fun of if you've never heard some other Filipino nicknames.  And I am in no position to snicker, having once voted in cold blood for a guy called Bubba for Governor of Louisiana.  He was the good-government candidate that year (at that time they were allowed one per election, and he always lost; this may have been in the Constitution).
