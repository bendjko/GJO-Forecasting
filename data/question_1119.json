We remind investors that the company has a tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, BMS-986165, in its pipeline, which is being evaluated in several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. The regulatory agency was concerned about a possible overlap between Otezla and BMS-986165 in the pipeline. The news was not welcomed by the investors as Otezla raked in more than $1.6 billion of sales in 2018 and was one of the key growth drivers for Celgene.  Sales of the drug are expected to come in around $1.9 billion in 2019 and retaining the same would have enabled Bristol-Myers to develop a strong inflammation portfolio along with its rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia. Hence, Bristol-Myers decided to sell Otezla.

Challenges will come from BMS's shareholders, on the basis on value, BS situation post deal and most importantly, opportunities for a third party takeover. 75% of BMS's shareholders are institutional investors [2], so will look for maximising the value. The Economist mentions Pfizer and Amgen. An analyst in Mizuho suggests that BMS as a potential takeover from J&J, Pfizer and Amgen, but also mentions a survey showing an 87% expectation for BMS to close the deal [3], but even Amgen seems to be the analyst preferred option, investors oppose to it. Amgen debt is high (271 debt/equity per [5]), but this is not the case for Pfizer and J&J. There could be more movements in pharma industry, as also The Economist explains [4], but probably Pfizer and J&J don't need the sales platforms and might face regulators challenges. Other smaller players should be considered, for a combined #4 or #5 in capitalisation. We have so many pros and cons that I consider this as guessing. Looking at the stocks, Celgene closed at $90.69 and BMS at $51.67, so, including the $ 50.00 cash, Celgen was 12% lower than the deal value. I would assign linear valuation to probability, so 88% YES. I give 10% to the Pfizer and J&J guess and 4% to any other player, to 74%.
