best actor.  Both are extremely talented, and both of the movies they were in were very successful.  I think that Ryan Gosling has a small chance, but not as much as Washington and Affleck.  I think that Washington has a slight advantage over Affleck for two reasons.  First and foremost, Washington won the SAG award for best actor, and the SAG award winners tend to continue on and win the Oscar.  Also, the Oscars want to recover from last year with #OscarsSoWhite, and they tend to try and prove a point through overcompensation.  Awarding Washington his second Oscar alongside Viola Davis would be a great way to prove that the Oscars are not racist.  And again, his performance was universally praised, so I award Washington the victory.

The new information I saw was that Denzel Washington won the Screen Actors Guild. A quick google search tells me that 18 of the last 22 actors who won the Screen Actors Guild won best actor. Casey Affleck won the critics choice and had largely been the favorite to win the Screen Actors Guild. I used Bayesian thinking to update my forecast after seeing Denzel won the screen actors guild. Denzel has 28.2% on GJP. I used this as an imperfect prior (The SAG award was given out two days ago, so many forecasters will already have adjusted their predictions since then). Taking into account that 18/22 actors who won the SAG won the Oscar, Bayes Theorem pushes Denzel Washington's win probability up to 64%. This was reported as an upset, meaning that the SAG may not be as good of a predictor of the Oscar winners in past years. Taking that into account, plus the fact that my prior may have been on the higher side, I adjusted my prediction for Denzel winning down to 58%. 44.6 of forecasters on GJP say Casey Affleck will win, and he has been racking up awards. I saw a report saying the race is down to Affleck and Washington, which I agree with. It appears to be a two person race. Gosling is charismatic, but is in a musical which typically will not produce best actor. I did not want to deviate from the wisdom of the crowd too much on Casey Affleck, so I settled on 41%. 538 has Gosling as least likely to win, despite receiving a 26% chance from GJP. I deviated from the crowd on this one, and I hope my reluctance to split the percentages in three ways does not come back to hurt me.
