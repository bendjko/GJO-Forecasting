With the median number of months per year in which riots occurred being 8 between 2009 and 2016, in only one year since 2009, there were riots in less than half of all months (the current count is 4 according to ACLED data). Overall, 70% seems be a reasonably conservative base rate. If riots took place in October 2017, this would be the fourth consecutive month this years in which protests were recorded. According to the data, it is relatively unusual that riots take place in four or more months in a row. Overall, this was only the case five times in the past two decades.

Elections increased the rate of riots and protests in 2014 so when looking for the mean I wanted to exclude riots and protests directly tied to the election cycle because Mozambique held elections in 2014.  My question was how often do riots and protests occur that aren't about politics?  How often do they occur when they are about politics?  And what is the base rate of riots and protests per month? Riots/protests that aren't about politics occur at a base rate of about 1 per month.  In 2015 and 2016 there were (4) and (2) respectively that were political in nature.  There was (1) in 2017 so far. At this point Mozambique is below the mean baseline for riots and protests so there is a higher chance of one occurring.  But there were five straight months where nothing happens like January to April of this year.  Therefore, I think there is a 75% chance of a riot occurring in the next three months and a lower chance of a riot occurring in the next month. \n"], [39813, "2017-09-29T10:45:45Z", [0.86], ""], [35747, "2017-09-28T23:01:42Z", [0.88], ""], [33846, "2017-09-28T19:05:06Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2017-09-28T17:11:19Z", [0.52], ""], [39781, "2017-09-28T10:52:24Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2017-09-27T20:45:29Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T20:42:57Z", [0.25], ""], [8336, "2017-09-27T19:34:00Z", [0.7], ""], [40356, "2017-09-27T15:02:43Z", [0.67], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T03:36:56Z", [0.52], ""], [691, "2017-09-26T19:39:32Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2017-09-26T17:27:21Z", [0.89], ""], [598, "2017-09-26T14:07:34Z", [0.9], ""], [11057, "2017-09-26T13:00:43Z", [0.72], ""], [40307, "2017-09-25T21:04:22Z", [0.6], ""], [39950, "2017-09-25T20:28:43Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-25T16:52:25Z", [0.89], ""], [1333, "2017-09-25T15:59:40Z", [0.25], ""], [37368, "2017-09-25T14:29:21Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2017-09-25T12:36:02Z", [0.34], ""], [691, "2017-09-24T20:20:41Z", [0.34], ""], [39997, "2017-09-24T20:05:49Z", [0.0], ""], [22264, "2017-09-24T19:38:50Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-09-24T17:46:47Z", [0.89], ""], [368, "2017-09-24T17:45:38Z", [0.0], ""], [38778, "2017-09-24T16:22:46Z", [0.75], "I'm bumping this up a bit after a some additional research on events in Mozambique.

Mozambique: Maputo Assembly Approves New Bus Fares\nhttp://allafrica.com/stories/201709210890.html Bus fares in Maputo will be increasing in an attempt to incentivize more bus drivers to operate. This fare increase will take effect once newly consigned buses arrive in the city. The last increase, in 2012, prompted protests in the city.  There are at least two possible caveats to this, however: 1) The protests may occur in the next few days and fizzle before October and 2) Because the increase will only take effect once new buses arrive, the real sting of the fare increase will be delayed, and I have no idea when the new buses are supposed to arrive.

So: 1 event in May; 4 events (2 of which were related) in July; 1 event in August (which was related to one of the July incidents); 1 incident in September.  = 7 events in 9 months =  0.77 events a month. Apart from the May event none of these are directly connected with unambigiously political-party questions; there are also no impending elections that might serve to aggregate social tensions. The brief description of the events suggests that most or all of these riots were not premediated, but occured in response to specific (and seemingly in one case accidental) events. Looking back at recent years: (the four year period from Sept 2013 to Aug 2017) There were 15 riot events between Sept and Dec 2013 = an average of 3.75 events per month. However, numerous incidents In November (and particularly late November) were directly related to (local?) elections \u2013 a type of event that will have no parallel during the period under consideration for this question. Therefore I think it reasonable to regard riot events that are directly associated with a domestic election as void for purposes of calculating averages for the purposes of this question, as they are liable to a time of untypically heightened tensions. When these events are excluded, there were still six riot events between Sept and Dec, giving an average of 1.5 per month, There were a large number of riot events in 2014, but they were mostly concentrated in a period of not much more than four weeks in September/October, coinciding with parliamentary elections.  If the whole of September and October 2014 are excluded from consideration (as being untypical), in the remainder of the year, there were 10 riot events during the course of the year.  (10 events in 10 months \u2013 1 event a month.  (There were 31 events in Sept-Oct, of which 26 were directly related to the election, but the heightened tension maybe means excluding the period, rather than discrete events, may be more helpful.) Jan 2015 is also an atypical month, as three of the four riot events in that month were also directly related to political developments \u2013 the swearing-in of the new recently-elected parliament.  When those three events are excluded, there were a total of 18 riot events recorded during the year.  = 1.5 events per month.  2016: 15 events = 1.25 events a month In short, 2017 so far is exceptional among the last four calendar years in returning an average of under one event a month. However, another approach (and one that takes account that it is not uncommon for multiple riot events to occur in response to a common trigger incident, even outside election season):\nIn how many months since 2014 have no events been recorded?\nSept-Dec 2013: Dec\n2014: April, June, August, November (4 out of 12:  events recorded in 8 out of 12 months: 0.67)\n2015: February, May, July, August (4 out of 12:  events recorded in 8 out of 12 months: 0.67)\n2016:  April ONLY (1 out of 12: events recorded in 11 out of 12 months: 0.92)\n2017 to date: Jan, Feb, March, April, June (5 out of 8 months so far: events recorded in 3 of 8 m months: 0.375)\nAggregating this:  no riot events were recorded in 15 months out of the last 48 months.  Riot events were recorded in 33 of those 48 months  (0.69 of them) Taking 0.69 as the base rate for riot events, and adjusting down a little to take account both of the overall lower rate of events in 2017 compared with recent years, and the absence of any anticipated scheduled obvious probable triggers ."], [233, "2017-09-17T20:46:49Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-17T20:31:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-17T19:58:58Z", [0.38], ""], [29980, "2017-09-17T15:29:33Z", [0.95], ""], [35398, "2017-09-17T13:45:32Z", [1.0], ""], [16851, "2017-09-16T22:30:16Z", [0.9], ""], [368, "2017-09-16T22:04:39Z", [0.0], ""], [11057, "2017-09-16T20:10:39Z", [0.59], ""], [368, "2017-09-16T19:23:18Z", [1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-09-16T18:27:15Z", [0.8], ""], [28414, "2017-09-16T18:23:01Z", [0.6], ""], [38419, "2017-09-16T18:01:45Z", [0.45], "There have been protests in four of the past nine months.

For those caused by the police not to occur, it would require a major concerted police training program with emphasis on both crowd control and the appropriate use of force. Even if immediately implemented and with strong departmental and political backing plus strong civil and NGO watch groups, this would require months to accomplish. The labor wage issue could easily go on for months as well based on the gap that exists between management and workers. For these reasons, both protests and riots could easily break out in October.
