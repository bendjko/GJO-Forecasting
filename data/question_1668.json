It is using the rhetoric of \"the recovery Olympics\", in par with the Antwerp 1920 (post WW1), and Beijing 2008 (post financial crisis)\n3. Its biggest regional rivals, China, are set to host the Winter Olympics 2022 - and so Japan would be reluctant to lose the \"sign of revival\" limelight to Beijing - a sentiment which would be endorsed by IOC major stakeholders s.a. USA, Canada, and major European countries like Germany. Despite the great historic tensions between the two Asian giants, Japan has lately taken a more diplomatic approach with China and the Olympics will be a great platform for Japan to show its equality/superiority indirectly.\n4.

This is obviously to make sure the impact of COVID is limited. @TheGuardian\nThe torch relay has started on March 25th, which is a clear signal that they wish that the Olympics are going ahead. However, this might still not be the case for the Paralympics. @TheGuardian\nThe book \"Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics\u201d by @RobertBaade and @VictorMatheson (2016) states considerable costs for infrastructure, ceremonial and security. The benefits like tourism will not come to fruition. So the book will not address the lack of income. What we will already know is that the benefits will be near to non-existent. But the reputational damage to cancel the Olympic Games at such a late stage will be always remembered in the history books. Even though it might make sense to cancel the games from a financial perspective, Tokyo would not like to be labelled as the games that never happened.\nThe main obstacle is the assurance that athletes will not be infected. This might prove a challenge, as many athletes participating in the Indoor European Athlectics Championships in Poland during March 2021 were tested positive for COVID during the event. Knowing that you cannot avoid athletes mingling (especially during a Summer Olympic Games event where 42 condoms per athlete were purchased in 2016). @TheGuardian\nWhen the Olympics go ahead then it allowing the Paralympics to go ahead seems logical.

Even if the enthusiasm for having the games is low within the Japanese population, the government will see this as a challenge to prove that they don't break the same promise twice. The 15.000 athletes (or significantly far less this time) + their huge entourage will be \"stored away\" from the local population, so I see no big risk of contagion here. \nThe trust in vaccination might be lower in Japan than in some other countries (65% are willing to get the shot), but publicly communicated behaviour has a normative force, and as soon as vaccinations run and being vaccinated is combined with certain facilitations, the rate of sceptics will decrease.

An outright cancellation has thus clearly required extraordinary circumstances in the past. However, the Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary circumstance. A key difference between the world wars of the past century and the current pandemic, though, is that relief, if not an outright end, is in sight. Multiple effective vaccines are in production and distribution worldwide, with updates that protect from known immune-escape variants on the way. While this coming fall and winter (2020-2021) could be dominated by circulation of immune-escape variants, it seems likely to me that the combined effects of cumulative exposure and vaccination will bring worldwide immunity to far higher levels and virus circulation to far lower levels by next summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, it would seem most likely to me that the most probable worst-case scenario would be postponement of the Olympics and/or Paralympics to next summer.  With the games scheduled to take place only four months away (as of today, 3/22/21), the window for the games to be postponed or canceled is narrowing. Business commitments will be increasingly difficult to cancel as we move closer to the events. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee has consistently publicly expressed its commitment to holding the Olympic games, and two days ago, the committee issued a statement saying that international spectators would not be allowed at the Olympic games. The Tokyo Olympic organizing committee is also trying to balance the goals of making the Olympics happen and bringing a tourism boost to the Japanese economy (http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14288811). Moreover, public sentiment in Japan and at least several other nations is also clearly against holding the Olympic games this summer (http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14291400). The Tokyo Olympics organizing committee is clearly doing everything in its power to make the Olympic games happen, but it's certainly possible that they will end up bowing to public and potential political pressure not to hold the games this summer. But I can't imagine they will give up on holding the Olympics altogether. That would be a tremendous loss economically and in terms of losing face. I would suspect that the Olympics and Paralympics games will be postponed or canceled in tandem. I see no reason why one would take place without the other. There are large economic efficiencies to holding both together, as well. So the question in my mind is not whether they will be canceled this year but whether they will be postponed until next summer. I'd give that possibility approximately a 50/50 chance.

On the one hand, this rate should fall due to factors such as the advanced stage of planning, Japan's great desire to save face and their not relying on revenue generated from travellers, making it possible to let the games go ahead without foreign spectators (as currently planned).  However, there are some scenarios in which the games would nevertheless get postponed again, such as an outbreak of a vaccine-resistant strain either in Japan or in many countries around the world stopping athletes from participating. Another alternative is that Japan levies heavy travels restrictions on afflicted countries, which causes a substantial proportion of athletes to be unable to participate and thus warrant another postponement. However, I find these unlikely as it is common to have travel exemptions for athletes and some countries (like Russia, the UK and the US) are likely to have their athletes vaccinated by then.

Cancellation risk may come from disagreements among the athletes/IOC/Japanese government about postponement vs. cancellation, and/or a push for delay or postponement by sponsors if the torch relay confirms worries about the games being bad content, and/or an erosion in public support amidst a COVID surge.  A critical piece to consider is that the games start on July 23, and the question is asking about cancellation before May 1. It\u2019s not \u201cwill the games be cancelled\u201d period, its will they be preemptively cancelled in the coming weeks. Will they be cancelled at all I would put closer to maybe 8%. I think the first key questions to answer are what public sentiment in Japan will be like around the games in the coming weeks, if/how the government will respond, and if/how the IOC will respond. Japanese citizens have been largely opposed to the games happening on schedule. The most recent poll I\u2019ve seen was at 61% calling for postponing or cancelling, though that\u2019s down from 80%+ back in January when COVID was worse. Japan has had issues with vaccines in the past and public confidence has been shaky and the rollout slow, so the population will not be as thoroughly vaccinated as other wealthy countries in the run-up to the games. Further, Japan will most likely see an increase in cases over the next few weeks mirroring the rest of the world, as their current cases have plateaued.  That increase will likely lead to decreased support for the games going ahead as planned, raising the chance of cancellation. However, Tokyo has already put in new lockdown measures, and the country does have a good track record for containing the virus. I wouldn\u2019t expect opposition (or caseloads) to return to January levels either considering the seasonality. It is possible for opposition to go up more quickly though, since we\u2019re getting closer to the scheduled start of the games and the idea of the games starting and tourists or Japanese people coming to spectate will feel more real. The games will be happening in the summer though, so the Japanese government/IOC may be more willing to bet on cases being lower and support higher by the time the games come. How would the IOC and Japanese government respond to increased or consistent opposition? The IOC has been adamant about hosting the games and has a huge interest in the games continuing even if without fans. 73% of their historic revenue is from TV rights (maybe less so if the games are less hyped this year though), so a cancellation is far worse than even a worst-case no-fans Olympics. The IOC will almost certainly want to go ahead, so the most likely source of a response would be from the Japanese government.  PM Suga would most likely not want to cancel the games early. Regarding COVID, he did have a program promoting domestic travel which was cancelled, and his popularity took a hit as it was blamed for Japan\u2019s recent spike in COVID cases, so he may be more conservative around COVID in the future. However, as an advisor to Abe he was very focused on economic development and seems to have kept that focus as PM, despite recent backtracking on the GoTo program, and spectators at the Olympics are usually expected to be a huge economic boon. He has also been publicly in support of the games and pledged to continue preparations in his New Year\u2019s address, and that was when public opposition was even higher, so a preemptive cancelling of a promise made in those conditions would be a pretty big move. This type of scenario would've been very foreseeable as well in January when he reaffirmed that the games will go ahead, nobody was expecting COVID to be cured by June. The current state of affairs is probably what would be expected, something very significant and unexpected would probably be needed to result in a cancellation. Another consideration is the timing of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in February, 7 months after the start of the Tokyo Olympics. Suga has pitched the games as a symbol of humanity overcoming the coronavirus, a theme in which China has been seeking to pitch itself as a global leader. Suga doesn\u2019t seem to be the nationalist that Abe was, but nationalism remains a theme in the LDP, not to mention the importance of Japan\u2019s alliance with the US. To cancel the games, only to have China host the first post-COVID Olympics a few months later, would be a very bad look. On the other hand, having to cancel the games amid an outbreak may look even worse. Thus far the attitudes of Japan and the IOC have been to have contingency plans regarding spectators depending on how serious a threat COVID is, and to push countries to prioritize vaccinations for athletes (while tiptoeing around the ethics of doing so).  The Japanese public doesn\u2019t support cancelling outright either. In the most recent poll only 28% of Japanese respondents said they wanted the games to be cancelled. Postponing has been the more popular option. An outright cancellation would be a pretty huge loss for pretty much every party involved as well, especially compared to postponing. The IOC\u2019s precious broadcast rights can at least be partially saved by postponing rather than cancelling. The Japanese government would be embarrassed and sad to see the economic activity never happen at all instead of just happen later. Most of the discussions (that are being reported) currently happening are around how to accommodate spectators, with no spectators at all as a worst case, so a jump to cancellation would probably be pretty sudden internally as well.  Where could a cancellation come from? Cancellation may come from disagreement among the parties involved. The IOC and Japan could disagree over timing (or something else) and Japan could force a cancellation rather than compromise, and scapegoat the IOC in the process. It may become clear that the preparations for the games for getting athletes there or keeping them safe are just woefully inadequate, though before May would probably be a bit early to say. The athletes could force a cancellation by refusing to accept a postponement.  Japanese sponsors may pull out over the risk of being associated with an unpopular games. Back in January Reuters ran an article about sponsors rolling back or delaying advertising as Japanese cases hit a peak, public confidence dipped, and concerns about a delay weren\u2019t exactly addressed. The torch relay is coming up in late March, and it\u2019s unclear whether spectators will be allowed amidst Tokyo\u2019s lockdown. Torch runners running down empty streets may be the depressing sight necessary to push sponsors to force a change. The games seem to have been treated as a national project by the sponsors though, which makes a full pullout unlikely and would allow for some flexibility with the costs of another postponement, but they may also reach the conclusion that a depressing games is worse than no games.  As for recent news, Japan has decided not to allow overseas spectators, which should definitely help quell the concerns of Japanese citizens about virus spread. Suga had a call with Bill Gates emphasizing the importance of vaccinations for the games, meaning its more likely that athletes will have some access to vaccines. I'll need to reassess during and after the torch relay and see how things look."], [1333, "2021-03-16T18:13:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [1639, "2021-03-16T17:13:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], "Fans will reportedly not be allowed to travel to Japan for the Tokyo Olympics or Paralympics this summer, according to multiple reports.

There are three factors that are being looked at: vaccination trends (this is increasing worldwide but the Japanese rollout is slow and the population hesitant), variant trends (these were increasing but there is more certainty that the vaccines will have some effect in suppressing their spread), and travel (governments are taking a cautious approach, especially as different countries have different vaccination rates). The betting market slightly favors that cancellation will occur (by August, not necessarily May 1) but the trend has been decreasing as optimism grows with the vaccines and fewer cases. The three factors (vaccines, variant, travel) still have uncertainty since vaccine rollout is relatively new and countries are being cautious with travel restrictions.  A wait and see approach is necessary since the data is too green with regard to these factors.  As such the IOC and Japan are likely to wait as long as possible before reaching a verdict.  May 1 is too close and a decision to cancel is therefore unlikely by then.  If a decision is made it is more likely to be another postponement than an altogether cancellation since there is so much invested already.  That Paralympics are scheduled for one month later so a verdict regarding that event is even less likely though it is probable that a decision for both events will be made at once since they rely on each other for synergies.

I'd start by taking the risk of cancellation up to 25% after a skim of info.\n- Case rates in Japan have fallen substantially since the Jan21 peak, but vaccination looks to be rolling out slowly. This lowers the chance of cancelling by, say, 10%.\n- Worldwide rates will continue for the period to be very variable - some athletes will come from high incidence locations.\n- Keeping people safe is an important political goal and is something of a mitigator of the power of the undoubted political and financial \"sunk investment\" in encouraging holding the games no matter what.\n- given this, and the report that the Japanese people may be negative about the Olympics (press: 80% against, Jan 21), the politics is less clear than I initially imagined. Taking these 2 last factors, I add 5% back.\nOn the side of saying 'no', as others have noted, mitigations to Covid are now well developed - testing and quarantining, masking and distancing, restrictions on crowds, etc.\n- the G7 have reportedly stated their support for the games continuing, as have IOC officials.\n- Other sporting events (tennis, football) have also now restarted or continued, including internationally, suggesting it's unlikely nations or sporting bodies will want to withdraw. Take off 10%.\nHowever, it is not surprising that no one is talking up the chance of cancellation - all those speaking have an inherent interest in being optimistic. That does not mean that the Japanese government won't be forced to make the ultimate difficult call eventually. Add back 5 for the gap.\nIt is worth noting that it is possible, if unlikely, that other causes of cancellation could arise\n- a major earthquake in the Tokyo area;\n- significant volcanic activity & ash clouds causing air travel to be severely disrupted\nFor both these, the chance is deemed extremely low due to short time span in mind, but not completely negligible.

Perhaps the olympic committee will buy the required doses needed to make sure all athletes are vaccinated before attending? We have seen in many sports leagues come back to a semblance of normalcy, but with heavy covid protocols in place. Sports leagues like the NBA require athletes to miss games if testing positive for covid. This is the one aspect that gives me pause. As soon as one athlete gets tested positive, and can't compete, the round robin format of many sports in the olympics would essentially disqualify them. This would ruin the legitimacy of much of the competition for athletes and viewers. Finally, if the olympics is cancelled, they'll do the same with the paralympics.

But for a country that managed keep infections low it will be very nerve wracking to think of all the thousands of athletes and coaches from all over who will travel, some that will be careful and others that may not.  It\u2019s also not yet clear how many athletes will really be able or want to travel.   I mean can you imagine the opening ceremony where all the athletes parade around?  That tells us just how many people all have to \na) isolated for a time on entry to Japan \nb) managed to be kept relatively separate from each other during the games \nc) the volunteers still need to be willing in sufficient numbers to support the actual management of the games and \nd) the additional testing regimes that need to be put in place.

Plus have we forgotten that Japan has a huge older population that would be extremely vulnerable to the virus.  If the more infectious strains circulating now got out in Japan it could be devastating. Once the risk to the older population feels real then pride and economics will be truely tested against life.  One way to think of how Japan views this is to consider that a state of emergency has been declared in a country with double the population of the UK, yet infection rates are 10% of the UK.   It is an unenviable position to be in and the Japanese government have some really tricky maths to do!  If COVID can be classed as an Act of God in legal terms then all those sponsorship contracts could probably be got out of, making the decision easier.  The flame is due to start its tour on 25 March.  I think a decision could be taken by then, especially if prefectures do try to withdraw from the flame tour.

Six months before the Games are to commence, half of Japan's population is under emergency lockdown, hospitals are overwhelmed with COVID patients, and the so-called \"indispensable\" chief of the Tokyo Organizing Committee has just resigned in disgrace yesterday.[2]  Vaccinations have yet to start in Japan and are not due to begin until March.  The public remains strongly opposed to holding the games.[3] With the new global consciousness about equity, especially among elite cosmopolitan global institutions like the IOC, it seems to me that they would be disinclined to hold the Olympics and not the Paralympics, as some have been forecasting here. Against my view, public opinion is much more volatile than I imagined.  The latest poll of those Japanese opposed to the Games going forward is 60%, down from 80% in January.[3]  Still, only 38% of public favor holding the games.  Also against my view, the Olympics exist primarily as a programming content vehicle for advertisements by powerful multinational corporations.   The suasion those companies hold with the IOC and Japanese officials should not be underestimated.

Our ability to manufacture boosters will  be constrained for many months, pushing our ability to achieve 85% herd immunity well into 2022.  Even if we can vaccinate developed countries,it is hard to imagine providing a level of protection to allow athletes and visitors from the developing world.[2]   To hold a successful, safe games, we would need widespread global distribution of vaccines and declining infection rates.  Vaccine nationalism and the explosion of infections where the variants predominate undercut a science-based approach.  Even if it is logistically possible, Japanese public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed.[3]  For something seen by most people as a \"nice to have\" event, it is hard to see how the Japanese government will allow a massive global super spreader event when 80 percent of the public opposes it, up almost 20 points from a month ago.

He continues and states he would back a cancellation if it came to that. 2. It has been 15 days since Perth hosted the return of sports and the crowd numbers are; 22k on 16th, 25k on 19th, 25k on 26th and 20k on 27th.

We have a low case count and have only let through competing athletes and support staff, they were required to undergo 2 weeks quarantine and testing before being allowed into the community, there is still no non-essential travel, there has been a reasonable community response and with very few exceptions people have cooperated with government orders.
