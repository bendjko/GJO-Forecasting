China has engaged 138 countries and 30 international organisations in the BRI.[114] Infrastructure projects include ports, railways, highways, power stations, aviation and telecommunications.[115] The flagship projects include the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Boten\u2013Vientiane railway in Laos and Khorgas land port.\nIndia believes the \"China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor\" (CPEC) project ignores New Delhi's essential concerns on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative BRI participants span the globe, although significant regional variation exists: overall participation levels are highest in Central Asia and Africa, lower in Europe and Latin America, and non-existent in North America.\nHowever, BRI participants are not all created equal.\nA MoU - memorandum of understanding- is the highest level of agreement for parties to the BRI.\nIn contrast, cooperation agreements have more general terms and may simply express a shared intent to collaborate in the context of the BRI.

They have the highest percentage of collective defense agreements with the United States and are the most democratic, most politically stable, and most economically developed. - Of the countries that have signed a cooperation agreement with China to participate in the BRI, fully half are in sub-Saharan Africa. These states have the fewest collective defense agreements with the United States and are the least democratic, least politically stable, and least economically developed. - Countries that have inked MoUs to join the BRI are the largest group. Covid19 and the financial pressure it has put on various countries, as well as associated supply chain issues puts the BRI in lower priority level both for China as well as for other countries that may be inclined to sign a MoU.
