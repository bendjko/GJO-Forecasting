NH is a voting population of small-business owners and retirees. Inside: Hillary Clinton increased her stable base in NH from a 30% (2008) to around 40% (2015). Inside: It's hard to know what Sanders' constituent base in NH is. He increased poll numbers without a break since last spring, up to a ridiculously high 2/3 and a honeymoon-like 80% approval rating (Clinton: 70%). Pre-mortem: I'm heading for a score of 1.2 if Sanders wins (or 0.15 if not). I did a \"no-change, no-skill\" forecast and consistently neglected the possibilty for \"Berning\" change in the trajectory.  This is, sort of, peculiar, because the most active forecasters here confidently see see \"change happening\" with Bernie Sanders.

Bill Clinton was trying to garner support in those same NH areas where Sanders is trying to get his votes, this year. Call them \"the poor.\" Bill Clinton lost his bid in NH, as all the other democrats (read again, all) who tried to get \"the poor\" to vote. Hillary Clinton is well entrenched with the \"not poor\", like all the winners of the democratic NH primaries. This establishment is concentrated in one area of the state and their vote determined NH democratic primary winners for 30 years. Unless there was a change in population segmentations in NH, the \"not poor\" will do what they used to do before. I skimmed a consumer study reports to find out what the concentration of elderly rich is (true voters), and NH comes out very far up in the list. I asked @cdob63 whether there was a change in NH economics and he denies it. http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/102894 He actually writes, the 'not poor' are \"people who leaked out of Massachusetts to escape taxes came from the eastern part of that state, which is right where New Hampshire is. New Hampshire also has no sales or income tax\" (while you unwind your retirement stock portfolio). Yes, sure. The past is not predictive of the future.

Socialism (viewed from an American perspective among the electorate) has always been a negative in any electoral race.  States such as New Hampshire and Vermont, and possibly in Seattle, Washington has gain considerable traction among left of center democratic voters.  However, I doubt that this traction among democratic and independent voters can overcome the influence of 'ethnic voters'.  The recent trending in deportation proceedings and removal of illegal/undocumented 'aliens' within the country could potentially spell disaster for democrats.  The question of how much it influences the ethnic vote (particularly among hispanic voters) along with recent immigrants who identify religiously as Muslim shift the outcome in New Hampshire in either direction.  However, Clinton in my view holds the advantages of a strong political infrastructure; this however does not necessarily translate into a win.  Sanders does hold advantage as a known within the region among the electorate that simply want a different institutional manifestation of its politics.

If you followed the Master Class (click \"Training\"), such unease is a good sign that you missed something. However, feeling no unease doesn't tell you that you're automatically right. I predicted 37 and 42, this week. Now 77. I looked at disconfirming evidence, to make 37% look very unreasonable. I found:  A) Sanders try to target (female) young voters. Young voters seems to like Sanders a bit more, says Suffolk Uni survey, but so does the rest of the country, too. Everybody likes Bernie. Caveat for him: Half, or more, of those young voters don't vote, says www.civicyouth.org about the 2012 elections. National participation under 30 was 51% in 2012 (Will this rise in 2016?) Only hope: NH allows for registration on election day (big drop if NH would not). Bernie also is much more liked among men (same survey). Would young men like him even more? Sure! However, young men are reliable in forgetting to vote. They drink beer, or play video games. Finally, young votes account for 15% to 18% of all votes and New Hampshire is where \"platinum oldies\" retire (marketing term for rich old couples). B) Sanders is after the same socio-economic classes and precincts that Obama, Dean and Bradly wanted. History tells: They all lost to Clinton, Kerry, and Gore. C) Sanders is after the same SE classes that he won over in Vermont, but Vermont's median income was $10,000 lower than that of New Hampshire (in 2010). Hence, the message of \"social equality\" doesn't ring a bell in the rich world. Why should someone care about the ever growing Gini coefficient, if you belong to the happy few that benefit from it? They rather vote in the Republican primaries, or Madame Secretary. D) Sanders has very good popularity ratings among journalists and in polls. So did Obama in 2008. The Big O lost NH, though. And: Pollsters try to get a representative sample, but voters are not representatives of the population. E) Sanders is said to have an awesome grassroot enthusiams and lots of small (credit card) donors and a fantastic online action ... so did Obama and Howard Dean, before. It's said that the Clinton campaign caught up on this. F) Virtually all NH officials (D) back Clinton (except of course, the few progressives from Boston who live in NH). It would be quite embarrassing for them to let Clinton fail. I think they are reliable, very eager and capable to activate their cloud on election day, compared to the unions and the \"single parent moms with their babies\" who like Bernie so much. G) If you look at the campaign staff of Sanders and Clinton, you notice, of course, a huge rock star parade in the Clinton organization. That's not really surprising, nor telling you something about the quality of the staff. Past successes don't say anything. But! They're probably more shrewed. Story goes that a Clinton advisor was with Gore in NH and they arranged a traffic jam on election day, so that enough of the Bradley voters driving home from Boston would not get to vote. Z) Final straw that make my first predictions really look stupid: It seems that the campaign staff of Sanders is largely organized around folks from the Vermont network. They know how to massage the Vermont voter, but Vermont is not New Hampshire. I don't think they can talk the talk to get upper-middle class Manchester people to vote for Sanders. Oh, so much self-sabotage on my own predictions. Now, Hillary, I'm with you in NH.

Reasoning for my forecast: 1) On the one hand, the first portion of the CNN report simply suggests 50% Sanders and 40% Clinton among \"likely Democratic primary voters\" in New Hampshire. 2) On the other hand, breaking things into its parts result in something different, first. MATH: The [support of a candidate among registered Democrats] PLUS [candidate support among (33% Undeclared of which 38% show interest in Democratic primary)], based on the same CNN report, would result in a calculatory lead of 51% for Clinton over 47% for Sanders, because the Clinton base is reported to be stronger. 3) On the third hand, why not discount enthusiams for voting for the candidates (voter fatigue), too? 67% of Clinton supporters said they were \"very likely to vote\" in a Suffolk Uni survey from October, while 75% said the same when supporting Sanders. Hence, .51x.67=34.6% and .75x.47=35.2% (or a voter turnout of roughly 70%) with Sanders winning slightly with 50.8%. It seems to depend on the last day in a Get-the-Vote-Out blitz.
