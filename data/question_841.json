Also personal experience,  with the amount of noise out there, it's extremely difficult to get a specific name to stick in memories of the 'consumer. \"was that GGopen?\" It does help that I can look up the CNN segment and view it online. 2) The GJOpen segment, 1minute 50 seconds, airs only four times over an eight-day period so  10% is probably very over-estimated. OTOH just joining a website is not as much of a commitment as parting with money for goods. Q-factor range: Fareed - I'd assume his is positive (versus negative impact on sales), \nbut lower than average as his show is small subset of a large pool (all shows, all channels all days of the week.) Compare, for a baseline range,  to Oprah, an oulier with the  highest of all q-factors. Rate of return on Investment for a 7-minute segment on Oprah's favourite things during Christmas is several thousand percent return in terms of sales increase. 3) There was a direct call to action but it was about halfway through the segment so there is a risk people had tuned out by then and likely New Year's Eve there would be a lot of homey distractions, with family, party-prep, day-off pursuits, sleeping in (10 am), having lunch (1 pm), etc)   Also data supports around a 10 to 15 second attention span for ads so if the call to action appeared very early on I\u2019d bump things up but not here.  Finally, its a big ask to get someone to remember the segment (and get the website name right),  go onto website, read the details and sign up. Jan 8th might have a better spike in numbers but I\u2019m going with a around a 6% increase and max 10%.  Also remembering that there was a bump in numbers of around (2K? Not sure how many newbies that added)  this year based on GJopen being the topic on a German podcast. When all else fails ball park and estimate: a 3:41 segment generated around 5K new members and 1700 who generated one forecast (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/652299) at a time when crowd forecasting was growing in awareness and popularity vs a 1:50 segment that was less detailed (less graphics and less WIIFM, so around half for a segment half as long --  2500 to 850. \nI estimate lower than the 2500-850 range as crowd- forecasting is fairly mature now so anyone who has an interest probably also has an awareness and so wouldn't be new to joining this website. This ad would have more luck if directed to school/colleges/universities but it's the holidays so likely not watching CNN as much this week.

From that, 5000 sign-ups and 1700 initial forecasts over 1 week. On this occasion, audience is likely to be about 60% higher.  Also, there seems to be an explicit invitation to join up, and promotion of the 5 specific questions being asked in the Global Judgement Challenge.  Numbers are likely to be higher, and conversion of sign-ups into forecast--makers is likely to be higher than the 33% in 2015. On that basis, maybe 6000 (an additional 20% over 2015, so actually a _lower_ percentage of the segment's audience) sign-ups, leading to maybe 2400 forecasts (assuming 40% conversion of sign-ups to forecasts).  Add this to the 400-odd forecasters already here (and increasing by about 50 per day in the last few days), and we get to about 3200 (2400 + 400 + [8*50]). I think this is being a bit conservative, if anything.  I think there is room for increased natural recruitment as the 2017 Challenges wind up, and people come across.  Also, I think there is good potential for a snowball effect: as the serious forecasters see how many \"wild-and-crazy\" forecasts are made by neophytes, the Global Judgement Challenge will become relatively easier to make a forecast that \"beats the crowd\", and thus more a more attractive source of Accuracy and \"Brier vs Median\" points. So, in reality, median result is about 3200, but more likely to be on the upside of that than the downside.  However, being a coward, I will nudge that downwards in deference to the Consensus Trend forecast of a median result somewhere in the 1000-1500 range.  That leaves a median result for my forecast in the 2500-3000 range, and a reasonably Gaussian spread around that point. DEFINITIONAL ISSUES?\nSure.  I am assuming the cut-off is at midnight precisely between the 7th and the 8th.  I can see potential to artificially inflate the figures if the answer is coming in just short of a threshold between one answer category and another. So ...\n999- = 2%\n1000-2000 = 18%\n2001-2999 = 35%\n3000-4000 = 30%\n4001+ = 15% IMPLICATIONS?\nOnly a 20% chance (1:4 odds) that the outcome will be worse than the 2015 segment?  (That being 1700 new sign-ups + 400 current forecasters.)  Yeees, I think I can accept that. Only a 2% chance that (1:49 odds) that the GPS segment will result in less than _half_ of the new forecasts that the 2015 segment resulted in?  (That is, under 850 new + 400 current forecasts.)  Yes, I can live with that. Giving a 45% chance that the Global Judgement Challenge will become 3rd most-joined challenge (behind the Classic Geopolitical Challenge, and the Arab Strategy Forum, each of which contained questions open since September 2015)?  OK, I feel a little more uncomfortable about that.  On the other hand, weren't the much larger numbers in 2015, rather than the c.1000 active forecasters now, a testament to the original promotion in 2015? Ah well, it's all just a game, isn't it?
