I noted that economic indicators seemed solid and inflation remained weak despite a strong labor market. I saw increasing inflation as the biggest risk which was reflected in the upside potential I carried through May. That was a key part of my first mistake - I failed to adequately weight a lot of the research I was reading on lower inflation expectations in a highly globalized and technology-dependent economy. I'm not saying \"I should have known\", but rather that I failed to incorporate this at all and just assumed inflation had to pick up.  Throughout the Spring though it became clear that devolving trade negotiations and weaker global growth were pushing the Fed towards holding flat. This pushed me to my second (and in my opinion - fatal - mistake). I discounted two factors early on which ultimately pushed the Fed to cut rates - global growth and insurance. I didn't think the insurance rationale meshed with the Fed's data-driven approach, but didn't consider the fact that in a low-interest rate environment, 25bps ain't what it used to be and the Fed would need to act fast. I also ignored the sentiment that the Fed would consider more than just the US outlook when setting rates due to global inter-connectedness because I didn't agree that that was their mandate. Ultimately, the take-aways here were:\n1. Question the market implied probabilities, but listen to their rationales\n2. Think more broadly and put yourself in policy-makers' shoes when considering outcomes\n3. Don't wait for new information to materially alter your base case, slowly feed it in at the fringes.

I had always assumed the fed's job was primarily about preserving the value of our fiat currency via helping mitigate inflation (or preserve it at a 2% rate more or or less).  My initial prediction for lowering rates was based on that assumption and with a target goal of 2% and inflation <1.5% it seemed like it was in the feds best interest to lower rates to bump up inflation.   I decided to look at what the fed sees it's job as (see above) and only saw no reference to inflation (other than \"stable prices\").  With unemployment low and an historically high equities market, I'm not sure they'll feel motivated to cut rates.  With rates still low from a historic perspective, cutting them now will leave them less room to negotiate what they see as a looming global slowdown in the future.  That said, the market has priced in a cut, maybe somewhat less so than previously, so not cutting would likely lead to a market drop which could be seen as the catalyst for the economic downturn the fed sees as a real possibility.

An interesting article (below) discusses how the probabilities are derived: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swiss-watch-finance-where-fed-221110286.html What I couldn't find was much quantitative data on how accurate the aggregated forecasts are, so I did a little (unscientific) research of my own. The CME allows you to download data on predictions for past rate hikes. Unfortunately, I could only find historical data for the last 3 months (Mar - Jun). The results, however, are intriguing. The average Brier Score (over a 1 year period) is about 0.34. What is more interesting is that if you just look at Brier Scores over a 1 month period (time until question ends), the average for the last 3 meetings is almost perfect at about 0.01.  This analysis is obviously quite limited by its' sample size, but I could not find additional data. One other factor that could reduce confidence is that expectations were pretty clear for the March and April meetings and there was strong consensus around how the Fed would act. However, the last meeting (June) had a lot more uncertainty around it and the Brier Score reflected that (0.05 in the 30 days prior to the June meeting instead of >0.01 for the other 2 months). Based on this information, Bayes Theorem tells me I should go from 24% to 85% on the probability of a rate cut, but I'm not so sure. That being said, I'm still having trouble understanding the rate cut argument outside of the market feedback loop (i.e. the markets will get what they expect in order to sustain the expansion) described in this article.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4273215-2-loops At the end of the day, it just doesn't jive with the Fed's stated position of being data-dependent and honoring their dual mandate of employment and inflation to \"sustain the expansion\". Trade talks are back on (though the consensus view of their success is skeptical, but I think that matters more later in the year), inflation picked up in June, job growth is steady (though the devil may be in the details of wage growth and unemployment), and growth remains solid. While concerns are certainly materializing I don't see a real case outside of the market talked themselves into it. All of this is a long way of saying I'm going to stick with my current forecast because I think the market is ignoring some key fundamentals and over-reacting to a volatile, late-cycle environment that is coinciding with the Trade Dispute.

While these factors are not enough to make me think an increase is imminent (growth and inflation are still in line with expectations and risks remain), it certainly strengthens the \"hold\" argument A deeper dive into Fed comments suggest they will act \"as needed\". What outcomes would justify a need? In my opinion:\n1. Trade talks devolve and tariffs rise. Consensus prediction from major bank analysts is that there will be a pause on future increases coming out of this weekend \n2. PCE falls to 1.5 - 1.7% for June, Unemployment to rise by 0.2% or more, falling business confidence Another, less quantitative factor that keeps me above a 1 in 4 chance of a decrease is this desire by the Fed to lead markets and not just respond to economic data. At the end of the day, the inter-connected global economy and market feedback loops are just as risky to Fed policy independence as the Presidents' tweets. For instance, markets rise on expectations of a cut, the Fed holds flat, markets fall due to a repricing of the discount rate, falling markets decrease sentiment, confidence, investment, spending, and ultimately inflation, and growth which raises the recessionary risks the Fed is trying to fight.  That being said, I think a productive G20 (75% likely), stabilizing data and no new GDP figures (most of it is already out, 50% probability for good June numbers), and continued earnings strength reaffirm the case for a \"wait-and-see\" through Q3.\n"], [128, "2019-06-28T12:44:42Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [57110, "2019-06-28T12:34:06Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [691, "2019-06-28T12:01:30Z", [0.0, 0.86, 0.14], ""], [25158, "2019-06-28T09:16:43Z", [0.01, 0.6, 0.39], ""], [578, "2019-06-27T22:10:17Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [74861, "2019-06-27T18:37:22Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "Based on Powell and other FOMC members' speeches, it seems pretty likely that they are going to cut rates on their July meeting date, which would reduce the upper limit by 25 bps."], [691, "2019-06-27T12:11:52Z", [0.0, 0.86, 0.14], ""], [75462, "2019-06-27T10:01:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [21884, "2019-06-27T07:39:27Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [21884, "2019-06-27T06:09:56Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1], ""], [67232, "2019-06-27T05:04:55Z", [0.02, 0.68, 0.3], "The economy is weakening, but we are only a few weeks a way from the deadline."], [62808, "2019-06-26T23:28:12Z", [0.0, 0.71, 0.29], ""], [26551, "2019-06-26T19:56:56Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [691, "2019-06-26T19:42:41Z", [0.0, 0.86, 0.14], ""], [61938, "2019-06-26T17:48:17Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [75093, "2019-06-26T17:07:57Z", [0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [67995, "2019-06-26T17:04:07Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [75190, "2019-06-26T02:13:12Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [128, "2019-06-25T21:59:38Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [128, "2019-06-25T21:55:48Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55], ""], [57797, "2019-06-25T21:42:19Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "Powell in comments today said the Fed would follow a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach.

The target range for the federal funds rate is almost certain to stay the same until 01 August, with an outside chance it might be lowered. As far as I can tell, the Fed might change the federal funds rate under two circumstances: (1) to fulfill its charter of minimizing unemployment and stabilizing prices, or (2) in response to outside (i.e., political, market) pressure. Unemployment is the lowest it's been in 50 years or so.  It's hard to imagine the Fed needs to do anything about that.  In other words, it doesn't need to lower the rate to help fire up the economy for the purpose of lowering unemployment. At the same time, inflation is running persistently lower than the Fed's target rate of 2%.  So the Fed does not need to raise rates to cool off the economy. But the Fed is in a bind, because this sort of very low unemployment and very low inflation aren't supposed to co-exist in the Fed's models (sort of similar, but in reverse, of the stagflation of the late-70s and early-80s). With unemployment this low and inflation this low, the Fed will not raise rates soon for the standard reasons.  But they are quasi-obsessed with the persistent low inflation, and there are voices calling for lowering the federal funds rate to help put some spark in the economy in order to raise inflation. On policy grounds, I think this is unlikely. First, the rate is already very low by historic standards.  This is one of the tools the Fed uses during a recession, and if they lower it, they will be hamstringing themselves should a recession come (and there are strong indicators of one in the next year or so).   Second, there is also serious discussion of reviewing the Fed's framework for inflation, to see if maybe it's time to rethink how they view inflation.  If that happens, I don't see them lowering it until that review has been completed. Third, the recent FOMC minutes indicate that, for the most part, the Fed plans to be patient and see how inflation plays out.  And since the last FOMC meeting, most of the FOMC's voting members have gone on record as saying they are happy with things for now, and there's no need to change the rate. So in terms of the Fed doing anything based solely on its charter, I think the rate will stay the same through 01 August. Then there's outside pressure. The President wants rates lowered, and he's made no secret of it. But whereas at one point I thought that might have undue influence on the Fed, the recent implosions of Trump nominees Stephen Moore and Herman  Cain make me think that the Senate does, after all, have some backbone and will stand up to Trump from time to time regarding certain issues.  Central banking appears to be one of those issues, and I am inclined to think that the Fed now knows that the Senate has its back, and thus it can proceed to make decisions based on policy without too much regard for political pressure. There is also the so-called \"Fed Put.\"  As I understand it, this is the idea that the Fed actually takes the status of the stock market into account when making these decisions.  The market's been having some bad days lately due to the trade war thing, and it's conceivable that should things really go downhill, the Fed might lower rates to help give it some juice. That's possible, but I think it's unlikely.  The market's problems are basically Trump-induced, and to respond to that would be in many ways responding to Trump's calls for lowering the rate.  Again, possible, but unlikely. So all in all, I think that on 01 August we'll wake up with the same target range as we see today.  \n"], [12856, "2019-05-24T00:26:01Z", [0.01, 0.95, 0.04], ""], [691, "2019-05-23T10:58:39Z", [0.03, 0.94, 0.03], ""], [67317, "2019-05-23T08:14:06Z", [0.0, 0.97, 0.03], "The Fed minutes."], [74067, "2019-05-22T20:43:05Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [57797, "2019-05-22T20:19:03Z", [0.0, 0.91, 0.09], "Fed minutes show an intention to keep rates the same \u201cwell into the future\u201d - CNBC.

The two measures of inflation -- CPI and PPI -- are very low.  Furthermore, as far as I can tell both the Fed and many economists are confused about why this is so with such a tight labor market.  But that is indeed the case.  One or  both of those would have to move upward significantly for the Fed to raise the upper limit on the target range.  That is certainly a possibility, but until we start seeing signs of it, I will discount the probability. On the other hand, I find it equally unlikely the Fed will lower rates between now and then.  Based on many economic indicators, the U.S. economy is doing OK.  A drop in GDP this quarter or next might well be attributed to one-offs like the trade war and the government shut down.  Until we see signs that the U.S. economy is significantly slacking and heading into recession territory due to structural weaknesses, I think it's unlikely that the Fed will lower rates. And what is the Fed saying? Two weeks ago two key Fed officials opined that they don't see a rate hike before this summer. On 12 Feb Jerome Powell said he saw the U.S. economy as being in pretty good shape. Finally, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said two things this past week in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. First, she said there is a good chance the U.S. central bank won\u2019t raise interest rates in 2019. \u201cIf the economy evolves as I just said I expect it to\u20142% growth, 1.9% inflation, no sense that [price pressures are] going up, no sense that we have any acceleration\u2014then I think the case for a rate increase isn\u2019t there this year.\"  More interesting, she suggested that the central bank could decide to use its balance sheet as a routine part of how it guides the economy, not just as a last-ditch measure to deploy in emergencies. This strikes me as perhaps being a trial balloon to gauge reaction.  If the Fed can use its balance sheet to make tweaks, it can leave interest rates alone.  I have seen in more than one opinion piece that the Fed really doesn't want to lower rates again to deal with a slowdown, because that would leave it with less leverage should a recession come along.   Bottom line, in the absence of some compelling reason to change course, I think the current range is what we'll most likely wake up to on 01 Aug."], [691, "2019-02-18T13:31:28Z", [0.21, 0.74, 0.05], ""], [38564, "2019-02-18T04:31:59Z", [0.8, 0.16, 0.04], "Interest rate normalization will have to continue."], [67483, "2019-02-18T02:28:27Z", [0.35, 0.59, 0.06], ""], [63674, "2019-02-17T23:42:35Z", [0.08, 0.88, 0.04], "The CME FedWatch Tool (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html) is saying 93% for the July meeting. However, independent probabilities would suggest that if the prior meeting has no impact on upcoming meetings (potentially dangerous assumption), then the probability of the Fed staying in the next 4 meetings is 85%. One thing that makes me feel better about my assumption is that each meeting's minutes will provide information to make an update.  I tried to use the Taylor Rule to inform my forecast, but that is highly dependent on the estimate of the neutral rate given that the other variables (GDP & inflation) are so close to their long-term trend. Based on the Fed's recent statements, they are pretty close to where they perceive the neutral rate to be. Factors that could keep the rate the same:\n- Fed is promoting a dovish stance\n- Data is pointing to a slowdown in growth, but not a decline in growth or sizable increase in inflation\n- Phillips Curve has yet to really carry inflation higher\n- Business confidence seems highly dependent on the Fed (listen to some earnings calls), and so the FOMC is probably watching I/S ratios and other measures of confidence closely. This would suggest that they would not want to be too aggressive  Factors that would push it higher:\n- Inflation (all the bullets are technically inflation, but I broke them out anyway)\n- Trade War raises input costs \n- Phillip's Curve finally drives sufficient wage growth\n- Wealth Effect (through housing or - more likely - market returns) increases spending\n- Increasing food/energy costs - could put pressure on products in Core CPI Factors that could drive a rate cut:\n- US tips into a recession before July, 2019\n- Something causes a massive deleveraging in the corporate bond market and the Fed is forced to step in Overall, I think the Fed is taking a wait-and-see with the impact of tarriffs on inflation and they are still waiting for low employment to translate to higher wages, more consumer spending, and inflation. Further, they are keenly aware of their impact on equity markets and seem more concerned about overshooting than undershooting. To change my position to an increase, I'd need to see a strong uptick in Core CPI data or the markets push considerably higher. A resolution to the Trade War would spark higher confidence in no action as opposed to an increase. The only thing I see pointing to a decrease is a confirmed recession.

I think the chance of an increase is probably lower than I thought due to how the Fed slammed the brakes. I agree with economists who believe the December hike was a mistake.

It was tough figuring out a base rate for this. At least it was for me.  We are in a somewhat unique historic situation with respect to rate changes, and I didn\u2019t quite know how to consider past situations. So I took another track.  I looked at how many forecasters had scored high on previous leaderboards, then averaged out their current forecasts.  Then I focused on the the strongest estimate (hint: it was \u201cSame\u201d). So I began with that average for \u201cSame\u201d, and then started factoring things in. The WSJ reported on 5 Feb that Fed Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said he believes the U.S. central bank will hold off on rate increases until at least the summer.  And of 7 Feb the WSJ reported that St. Louis Fed leader James Bullard said the central bank doesn\u2019t need to raise rates any further to achieve its job and inflation goals. Furthermore, the CME Fed Watch site has mid- to high-90s probability that the upper limit on the rate will not go higher over the next four meetings. Finally, in a Bloomberg article today on the Fed\u2019s next steps, it says: \u201cIn addition to the encouraging pace of employment creation, the last jobs report supplied the Fed with indications of remaining slack in the labor market. The direct evidence came in the form of a further pickup in labor-force participation, which illustrated the potential for more people re-entering the labor market. Further proof was provided by the relatively stable wage-growth number that prevails notwithstanding the JOLTS and jobless claims data that would suggest otherwise. You can add to that signs of a productivity pick up after years of unusually low growth.\u201d In short, there are two things the Fed could respond to: increased inflation (raise rates) or significantly decreased economic activity (lower rates).  Between now and 01 August it appears the odds slightly favor increased inflation over significantly decreased economic activity.  Thus I think the probability of a rate hike is slightly higher than a rate decrease.  But I think the preponderance of the probability goes to no change at this point.\n"], [691, "2019-02-11T13:13:50Z", [0.2, 0.74, 0.06], ""], [15196, "2019-02-10T20:27:42Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-02-10T19:33:48Z", [0.23, 0.61, 0.16], ""], [67377, "2019-02-10T17:58:31Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [62542, "2019-02-10T16:47:56Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [67374, "2019-02-10T04:30:53Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.1], ""], [67373, "2019-02-10T00:04:38Z", [0.45, 0.2, 0.35], "The US and global economies will experience an acceleration of growth or the deceleration with intensify.
