More interesting (and revealing) information is that while the moderates and conservatives are overwhelmingly against this proposition, only 46% of the liberals (and also 46% for the Democrats) are for it.  So it appears that affirmative is not as favored by the liberals as commonly believed.   Note that Washington state (another liberal state) rejected a referendum for the repeal of the banning of affirmative action in 2019. I am reducing the probability from my previous forecast.

That means more voters are in favor of banning affirmative action as stated in Proposition 209.  Proposition 209 was passed with 55%.  Despite California is a very liberal state and affirmative action is one of the pet project of the liberals, the banning of affirmative action appears to be still in favor by the current voters.   Part of the problem is due to the nature of \"affirmative action\".  Proposition 209 states that California \"shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting\".  The wording says it is against discrimination.  What is wrong with that? Indeed, quoting from Ballotpedia [2]: \"A no vote [on Proposition 16] opposes this constitutional amendment, thereby keeping Proposition 209 (1996), which stated that the government and public institutions cannot discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to persons on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting\".  Again, a no vote on Proposition 16 means you are for discrimination. I don't know how much of the wording affects the polls.  But it is definitely confusing, by the nature of affirmative action.  It is unlikely that this proposition will pass.

First, California is a very liberal state and many of the influential democrats in California have supported this bill. Second, given that this is occurring in a presidential election in a very polarized environment, I can imagine a lot of voters voting for this as an implicitly anti-Trump vote.  I would like to make a strong prediction, but I see no polling on this question online so it's hard to take a strong stand. In addition, from my skim of the wikipedia article it seems like polling on questions regarding affirmative action largely depends on how the question is phrased so I wouldn't read to much into that."], [89013, "2020-08-19T02:26:22Z", [0.07], ""], [89039, "2020-08-19T02:24:22Z", [0.61], "Our base rate should be 55 percent. That\u2019s the percentage of ballot measures that California voters have approved over the past ten years. Californians have a mixed record with affirmative action but not one that qualifies as establishing any significant history. Voters in the state have only considered such questions twice in 1996 and 2003 respectively. [1][2] Context will be important here. Both of California\u2019s senators, Diane Fienstein and vice presidential hopeful Kamala Harris among a number of others have backed the reinstatement of affirmative action. [3] Harris is a popular figure in the state and the referendum will in some way function as her final test as a United States Senator - at least before the November election. Most significantly, the vote comes during a time of heightened racial consciousness for many people and this will undoubtedly factor in the decisions of many voters.
