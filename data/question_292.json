consider the most important passage with regard to this question: \"Egypt embarked on an ambitious economic reform plan shortly after President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi took office in 2014. The government has slashed subsidies, imposed a value-added tax and allowed currency devaluation in order to qualify for a $12 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund. The austerity measures have hit the public hard, however, with inflation hovering around 30 percent for months, many import products unavailable, and soaring electricity and fuel costs.\" Financial measures that \"hit the public hard\" are generally not good for a country's long-term stability. I've thought all along that Egypt was the most likely candidate for some kind of unrest within this time frame, although if anything happens in Egypt - or any of the other countries listed - it will probably be quite sudden and unexpected. After all, who would have thought that the seizure of Mohammad Bouazizi's fruit stand would have been the spark that led to the overthrow of the governments of Tunisia and Egypt, a counter revolution in Egypt, and civil war and foreign intervention in Libya and Syria?"], [368, "2017-09-19T18:36:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [29266, "2017-09-19T09:44:38Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [368, "2017-09-18T19:33:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [38940, "2017-09-18T15:20:55Z", [0.06, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.88], ""], [691, "2017-09-18T15:03:48Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.96], ""], [1056, "2017-09-17T21:18:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-17T20:53:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [691, "2017-09-17T20:15:04Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.96], ""], [20588, "2017-09-17T05:15:56Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], "Just not gonna happen these days.

It's hard to establish a base rate for this one, since protests are apparently common but don't qualify as anti-government. Sporadic political violence plagues regions of the country.

Algeria is another -- although not mentioned here. Egypt and Tunisia seem to me the most likely nations where conditions are ripe for two or more anti-government mass protests within one week. A return of jihadis to Tunisia as well as economic and social discontent in a greatly strained Egypt provide just the daunting preconditions for such protests.
