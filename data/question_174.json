It therefore welcomes openly any suggestions on how to improve the work of the constitutional court. In our dialogue with the European Commission, we have assumed that our co-operation will be based on such principles as objectivism, or respect for sovereignty, subsidiarity, and national identity. \u201cHowever, we have gradually come to realize that interferences into Poland\u2019s internal affairs are not characterized by adherence to such principles. On top of that, such actions are largely based on incorrect assumptions which lead to unwarranted conclusions. So we regret to note that the Commission Recommendation is an expression of incomplete knowledge about how the legal system and the Constitutional Tribunal operate in Poland. \u201cIn the Polish government\u2019s response communicated to the Commission, this issue was addressed in great detail. As a result, we have concluded that we had no choice but to assess the Commission Recommendation of 27 July 2016 as groundless. Poland wishes to emphasize once again that the ongoing political dispute over the rules governing the work of the Constitutional Tribunal cannot form the basis for claiming that there is a systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland.

The Commission has assessed the overall situation, including in the light of the new law, and reaches the conclusion that even if certain of its concerns have been addressed by that law, important issues of concern regarding the rule of law in Poland remain.

The European Commission has today adopted an Opinion concerning the rule of law in Poland. Brussels, 1 June 2016 Following the intensive dialogue that has been ongoing with the Polish authorities since 13 January, the Commission has deemed it necessary to formalize its assessment of the current situation in this Opinion. As foreseen in the Rule of Law Framework, this is the first step taken by the Commission in this process. The Opinion sets out the concerns of the Commission and serves to focus the ongoing dialogue with the Polish authorities towards finding a solution (European Commission. Press Release. 1 June 2016). The Rule of Law Framework \u2013 introduced on 11 March 2014 - has three stages:\n\u2022\tCommission assessment:\n\u2022\tCommission Recommendation:  second stage\nFollow-up to the Commission Recommendation:  third stage Following an intensive dialogue with the Polish authorities, the Commission has adopted today a 'Rule of Law Recommendation' on the current situation in Poland, setting out the Commission's concerns around the functioning of the Constitutional Tribunal, and recommending concretely how these concerns can be addressed (European Commission, Weekly Meeting 27/07/20162016). This next step under the Rule of Law Mechanism follows the Commission's adoption of an Opinion on the situation in Poland on 1 June, and the adoption by the Polish Parliament of a new Law on the Constitutional Tribunal on 22 July. The Commission has assessed the overall situation, including in the light of the new law, and reaches the conclusion that even if certain of its concerns have been addressed by that law, important issues of concern regarding the rule of law in Poland remain (European Commission, Weekly Meeting 27/07/20162016). The European Commission on Wednesday moved to advance its disciplinary procedure against Poland in a case that revolves around changes made to the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal by the rightwing and Eurosceptic Law and Justice party. Critics say those changes have left the court paralyzed and unable to act as a check on parliamentary power (Foy, 2016). The deadline is the second in a series of formal steps taken by the European Commission, the EU executive, as part of what it calls a \u201crule-of-law mechanism\u201d triggered by what it considers attempts by the Polish government to politicize the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal and curb media freedoms (Pop & Drozdiak, 2016).

One-third of the member states or the Commission may invoke Article 7 by submitting a \u201creasoned proposal\u201d to the Council of the European Union\u2014the heads of state of the member countries\u2014alleging that a member state is engaging in a \u201cserious and persistent breach\u201d of an Article 2 value such as the rule of law.

This is a punishment that\u2019s never been invoked before, and has been called the \u201cnuclear option.\u201d It is intentionally difficult to invoke and carries draconian sanctions because, absent extraordinary circumstances, member states should have full autonomy over their internal systems of justice.

The Framework establishes a tool allowing the Commission to enter into a dialogue with the Member State concerned to prevent the escalation of systemic threats to the rule of law.\nThe purpose of the Framework is to enable the Commission to find a solution with the Member State concerned in order to prevent the emergence of a systemic threat to the rule of law that could develop into a \"clear risk of a serious breach\" which would potentially trigger the use of the 'Article 7 Procedure'. Where there are clear indications of a systemic threat to the rule of law in a Member State, the Commission can launch a 'pre-Article 7 Procedure' by initiating a dialogue with that Member State through the Rule of Law Framework.\nThe Rule of Law Framework makes transparent how the Commission exercises its role under the Treaties, and aims at reducing the need for recourse to the Article 7 Procedure.\nThe Rule of Law Framework has three stages (see also graphic in Annex 1):\nCommission assessment: The Commission will collect and examine all the relevant information and assess whether there are clear indications of a systemic threat to the rule of law. If, on this evidence, the Commission believes that there is a systemic threat to the rule of law, it will initiate a dialogue with the Member State concerned, by sending a \"Rule of Law Opinion\", substantiating its concerns.\nCommission Recommendation: In a second stage, if the matter has not been satisfactorily resolved, the Commission can issue a \"Rule of Law Recommendation\" addressed to the Member State. In this case, the Commission would recommend that the Member State solves the problems identified within a fixed time limit, and inform the Commission of the steps taken to that effect. The Commission will make public its recommendation.\nFollow-up to the Commission Recommendation: In a third stage, the Commission will monitor the follow-up given by the Member State to the recommendation. If there is no satisfactory follow-up within the time limit set, the Commission, the European Parliament or a group of 10 Member States could resort to the 'Article 7 Procedure'.\nThe entire process is based on a continuous dialogue between the Commission and the Member State concerned. The Commission will keep the European Parliament and Council regularly and closely informed.\nAt which stage are we under the Rule of Law Framework?\nThe adoption of the Rule of Law Opinion is part of the first stage of the procedure. The Polish authorities have now been invited to submit their observations. After examining this reply, or if no observations are submitted, the Commission may issue a Rule of Law Recommendation.

On 31 December, the Polish Senate adopted the \"small media law\" concerning the management and supervisory boards of the Polish public television broadcaster (TVP) and public radio broadcaster (PR). The new law appears to modify the rules for the appointment of the Management and Supervisory Boards of the public service broadcasters, putting them under the control of the Treasury Minister, rather than an independent body. The new law also provided for the immediate dismissal of the existing Supervisory and Management Boards. The rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded. The Commission, beyond its task to ensure the respect of EU law, is also responsible, together with the European Parliament, the Member States and the Council The precise content of the principles and standards stemming from the rule of law may vary at national level, depending on each Member State's constitutional system. Nevertheless, case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as documents drawn up by the Council of Europe, building notably on the expertise of the Venice Commission, provide a non-exhaustive list of these principles and hence define the core meaning of the rule of law as a common value of the EU in accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). This means that respect for the rule of law is intrinsically linked to respect for democracy and for fundamental rights: there can be no democracy and respect for fundamental rights without respect for the rule of law, and vice versa. Fundamental rights are effective only if they are justiciable. Democracy is protected if the fundamental role of the judiciary, including constitutional courts, can ensure freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and respect of the rules governing the political and electoral process.\n[PR from the EU parliament] The European Union executive on Tuesday said it would not escalate as planned its investigation into whether rule of law was under threat in Poland, but attend last-minute talks with Warsaw in a bid to resolve the dispute.\nhttp://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-constitution-eu-schinas-idUKKCN0YF17Y Poland is close to clinching an agreement with the European Commission to end the bloc\u2019s first-ever probe into the state of a member\u2019s democracy, Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said.\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/poland-says-it-s-near-deal-with-eu-to-solve-rule-of-law-dispute"], [19801, "2016-05-24T13:53:14Z", [0.7], "\" The European Commission is on Monday expected to issue an opinion critical of the state of democracy and the rule of law in Poland under the country\u2019s Law and Justice (PiS) government.The commission, the executive body of the European Union, last week gave Poland until Monday to find a solution to an ongoing row and a deadlock over the country\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal.

The so-called rule of law mechanism is essentially just a formal, structured dialogue between the Commission and the \"offender.\" The mechanism was introduced as a precursor to the actual sanctions procedure according to Article 7 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. This \"political atomic bomb,\" as it was described by the former EU Commissioner for Justice, Viviane Reding, can ultimately lead to the revocation of voting rights for the accused country. The EU has never yet applied Article 7. It didn't dare do so in 2010 when the EU Commission demanded a revision of changes to the Hungarian constitution. EU Commission has not so far detected any response to its concerns, it is now implementing the second stage of the mechanism by publishing a formal warning to Poland to return to constitutional principles. The Warsaw government now has just two weeks in which to respond to the warning. If it does not do so before the deadline, the EU Commission will submit a concrete recommendation as to the legal and political steps Poland must take in order to safeguard the rule of law, in particular the independence of the constitutional court and the freedom of the press.

Examples include the handling of the Roma issue by the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, attempts to impose one-party rule in Hungary, and an attempted crackdown on the judiciary in Romania. \"Under Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty, serious breaches to the values of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights by a member state can result in a suspension or loss of voting rights in the EU Council of Ministers. If article 7 is activated, this would mean that the country in breach would temporarily lose its EU membership rights. But before such a decision can be taken, the Council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations. \"But as Article 7 is described as a \u2018nuclear bomb\u2019 which may never be used, the previous EU Commission under Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso introduced a \"pre-Article 7 procedure\", which follows three stages. Those are: \"Commission assessment: As a first step, the Commission collects and examines all the relevant information and assesses whether there are clear indications of a systemic threat to the rule of law. If the Commission makes such assessment, it will initiate a dialogue with the country concerned, by sending its \"rule of law opinion\". The country concerned then has the possibility to respond. \"Commission Recommendation: In a second stage, unless the matter has already been resolved, the Commission issues a \"rule of law recommendation\" to the country concerned. It recommends that the member state solves the problems identified within a fixed time limit and informs the Commission of the steps taken to that effect. The Commission then makes its recommendation public. \"Follow-up to the Commission Recommendation: In a third stage, the Commission monitors the follow-up given by the member state to the recommendation. If there is no satisfactory follow-up within the time limit set, the Commission can resort to one of the mechanisms set out in Article 7 of the EU treaty. \"Before the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the EU imposed sanctions only once against a member state. In 2000, 14 countries of the then 15 member EU reacted to the entrance of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Austrian Freedom Party into the Austrian government by freezing bilateral relations with the country. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS RE POLAND:\n\"MEPs passed a non-binding resolution on Wednesday (13 April), calling on the Polish authorities to restore the ability of Poland\u2019s Constitutional Tribunal to uphold its Constitution and guarantee respect for the rule of law. The vote comes against the background of the unprecedented decision by the European Commission to start a potentially-punitive process aimed at buttressing democracy and rights in the 28 EU states. \"if the Polish government fails to comply with the recommendations, MEPs want the European Commission to activate the second stage of the procedure under the \u201cframework for addressing systemic threats to the rule of law\u201d, initiated on 13 January.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/a-challenge-to-polands-anti-democratic-drift.html?emc=edit_th_20160417&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=28699183 \". . . Wednesday . . .  the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on Poland\u2019s rulers to stop defying the country\u2019s top court. \" . . . there is little the union can do to compel Poland or any other member to alter its conduct, even though the resolution passed by a vote of 513 to 142. The resolution is nonbinding, and any punitive measures would require unanimous support in the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm. Hungary\u2019s similarly nationalist government, for one, would not support any such measures. Too much overt pressure, moreover, would only harden Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s resentment of the union. \"Yet it is incumbent on the European Union \u2014 and on the United States, which the Poles rightly see as their close ally and protector against Russia \u2014 to make clear to the Polish government that the rule of law is not a take-it-or-leave-it imposition by the \u201cold E.U.,\u201d but a central tenet of the democracy Poland signed on to. As Poland prepares to host a NATO summit meeting in July in the hope of landing large contingents of allied forces on its soil, Washington should remind Mr. Kaczynski that the alliance is, above all, one of shared values.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  There is concern in the EU about the rule of law in Poland. The concerns have been examined and assessed, and a non-binding resolution describing the findings has been passed by the European parliament; this represents the first 2 parts of the 3-part first step in a 3-step process which began in January.  in other words, there's a long way to go before membership rights might be suspended.   Here's a fastest-case scenario of what would need to happen for this to resolve as \"Yes\" before 1/1/17:\n-by mid-May Poland would have to respond to the resolution in a way unsatisfactory to the EU\n-by mid-June the EU commission would have to issue a \"rule of law recommendation\", setting a completion date prior to Dec (which seems to me to be an extremely short amount of time).  Poland would have to fail to comply.\n-before 1/1 EU MEPS would have to take punitive action.

Suspending membership rights might seem far-fetched for most because they don't know how often it happens, for what reasons, and in what forms. However, I take that the Good Judgement staff may also not know the exact lines. \"Suspend membership rights\" (the question) does not necessarily have to do with the dispute cited (the background info / question's explainer). Anyway, I did check the first two articles provided above, and this one: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/11/rule-of-law-poland-communism-democracy-europe I was studying EU law and EU policies extensively over the past few months (it's my field of studies after all). Suspending a membership right may mean simply to deny funds for one year in the context of EU regional policy. It may also mean a -0.5% GDP penalty deducted from other policies (especially since this MAY come at the cost voting rights). What I am trying to say is that membership rights may be suspended on many other fields and sub-domains. Anyhow, the constitutional system is not in the EU's exclusive responsibilities, nor is corruption, and other stuff like that.  -----\nNOTE: I had a detailed analysis here of timelines and how long it would take for the European Commission to start a legal process against states for violations of the treaties. I would correct the mistakes, but I'd have to transalte stuff from my book. However, I found this incredible source http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-law/infringements-proceedings/index_en.htm which not only presents the information better, but it is in English :D\n----- According to the link cited above, the process can go to Court, if Poland wants it. This could take 2 years to solve. My previous estimate was ~November-December 2016. ----\nNOTE: In another comment, I saw that there is also the possibility of pursing membership rights suspension through the European Parliament and the European Council (together), something that required a qualified majority (something hard to achieve).

All of these arguments, available under top posts, seem quite compelling to me.  Some of those forecasters feel that a higher than zero probability is called for.  My feeling why zero is especially relevant in this case is that it will take unanimous approval.  Its very hard for me to believe that not even one country would vote against, given we have \"persistently and seriously\" as the standard here.

The EU is not known for taking quick decisions, so it seems safe to predict such a momentous one would need more than the nine months remaining this year. As pointed out by @Dima-K below, the initial identification of a breach of EU's values would require a unanimous decision of the European Council (excluding the member state), and Poland probably has enough friends among EU's \"New Europe\" members to prevent that. I'm not aware that an EU member has had any of its membership rights suspended to date. However, the EU has plenty of leverage through other means, if it chooses.  It ostracized Austria when it elected a far right party, forced a change of prime minister in Italy, and most recently is dictating terms in Greece. It would probably try and influence the Polish government behind the scenes rather than attempt and probably fail to get approval for any form of suspension.  Financially, Poland receives more from the EU than it gives, so that is one pressure point.  However, in the past Poland has skillfully exploited its weightage in the EU's decision-making process, so those EU countries wanting to change some of Poland's internal policies may not find it easy. Unless the European Council officially identifies a breach through a unanimous decision, thus starting the process, there's no reason to go above zero."], [14493, "2016-04-06T08:23:18Z", [0.05], "As other comments have said the EU does not want to be seen to be bullying an elected government in a member state, but equally the Polish government may see that the consequences of trying to change its constitutional balance between government, courts, freedom of expression etc. could create more problems (e.g. spooking foreign investors, anti-government protests, annoying the US etc.).
