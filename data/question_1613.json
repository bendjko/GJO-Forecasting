As a result it is now getting ever harder to detect (and test and most importantly confirm and isolate) new cases, since many infections out in the society now will be asymptomatic. The numbers of daily increases in confirmed cases may have seen a breach of trend within the last week from a volatile stagnation into a modest decline.\nIt depends on the details in testing method and the assumed average inherent time lag (I assume 12 to 24 hours) between the test being taken has been recorded and a negative or positive result has been recorded under the COVID Tracking project.\nIf that holds, then it is interesting to see that a roughly constant level of new tests at about 300,000 tests per day after 7 May 2020 produced new confirmed cases on the following day at an absolute increase that's been declining between 9.4 per cent to 18.9 per cent day over day. An increase of new tests on Monday 11 May 2020 of 41,9 percent to 388,296 produced a scant increase in newly confirmed cases of 15.3 percent on Tuesday 12 May 2020, with some uncertainty due to the cut in the day count. As the number of test returned to its previous level on Tuesday 12 May 2020 (289,472), one could expect a sharp drop in newly confirmed cases today 13 May 2020 by up to 30 per cent.\nSo today's numbers will determine which path the numbers are actually on, and which one of the two most recent daily increases is the outlier. Until then, I leave my projection steady.\nAfter this week, however, most of the infected individuals in the society will be imho asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, which in turn are those with a higher individual reproduction rate; already in the week after Monday 18 2020 the average numbers of daily increases maybe return a next plateau of about 22,000 on average. It would be illusive and premature to expect the modest decline in the rate of newly confirmed cases to continue forever..."], [66692, "2020-05-13T04:23:01Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [66692, "2020-05-13T04:22:17Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87448, "2020-05-13T04:21:23Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87448, "2020-05-13T04:16:55Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87880, "2020-05-13T03:23:11Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.95, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2020-05-13T03:02:29Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [54962, "2020-05-13T02:48:20Z", [0.0, 0.12, 0.86, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87643, "2020-05-13T01:48:04Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.65, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [63674, "2020-05-13T01:41:09Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.79, 0.08, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88010, "2020-05-13T01:31:07Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.92, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-05-13T01:10:55Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "On the bubble, straddle the brink at least for today."], [34815, "2020-05-13T01:03:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31275, "2020-05-12T22:57:48Z", [0.0, 0.21, 0.75, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "If the next 5 days are just linear.

I crunched some #  using rolling 7 day averages:  add, subtract, multiply, divide  (simple math for a simple mind!)\nThen, I \"massaged\" my numbers for an increase in tests done. It's very interesting to me that as the # of tests has increased the % of positive cases has fallen.  For example, on April 13th when 129,114 tests were done, 19.3% were positive, whereas for the last week the average has been 8.8%, when 276,308 tests were done on the average day.  This is how/why even though the # of new tests has increased to almost double, the # of new positives has not increased much. From what I've read and been told, almost nobody used to get tested until they were sicker than a dog, at the ER, and in a high risk category, now asymptomatic people are getting tested at job sites; this explains the lower % of positive cases, I think."], [88472, "2020-05-11T17:06:58Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Based on the current number of infected people, the current weekly moving average growth rate of infections paired with the assumption of its decline by 1% per day, I end up with a figure of 1,442,000 million people on May 17.
