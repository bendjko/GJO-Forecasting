Yes\nWill Ada's price increase by more than 363%?\n\tCan the price increase by more than 363% in 4 months? Yes All outcomes are statistically possible. Cryptocurrencies are currently very volatile (in the positive almost exclusively).  Why would Ada's price go up substantially?\n\t\u2022 Momentum in the crypto currency sector, most if not all crypto platforms have seen excessive growth across 1 week / 1 month / 3 months / 6 months / 1 year\n\t\u2022 Current trajectory could continue\n\t\u2022 Further  federal stimulus could provide another large injection into equity markets including cryptocurrencies (bull market)\n\t\u2022 Economic uncertainly in equities could push investors out of equities and into cryptocurrencies, believing them to be a store of value\n\t\u2022 Global vaccinations and decreased wave peaks mean economic activity pickups up driving up asset prices\n\nWhy would Ada's price be the same or slightly higher in 129 days?\n\t\u2022 Currency is up large figures in the short/medium/long term, turns s-curve rather than bell-curve\n\t\u2022 Current price is all time high ($33.3B), market plateaus again\n\t\u2022 Mixture of stimulus and lockdown alleviations (at least temporarily) may give people money to spend other places, but they will continue holding current crypto positions\n\t\u2022 Price can inflate greatly and pop but end up at relative current price July 1 out of luck. Opposite is also possible. Why would Ada decrease in the next 129 days?\n\t\u2022 Cryptocurrencies are a bubble, people sell off to move to other asset classes\n\t\u2022 Ada is a bubble, the market momentum moves to other platforms or recognizes one/two top cryptos to support\n\t\u2022 Market illiquidity leads investors to sell off some/most crypto positions\n\t\u2022 Vulnerability in infrastructure/\"plumbing\" leads to large heist that shakes market confidence in the platform I put my bet on the corners. Price will change more than -43% or +131%, making the 2nd option a very low probability. Another 3x price change is 4 months is not out of the realm of possibility but I have some doubts. I don't see a market event taking the crypto sector in a negative direction in the 129 days before the question closes. Highest probability in the 131 - 363% increase, next is drop greater than 43%."], [55987, "2021-02-22T16:54:53Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.9, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [34815, "2021-02-22T04:54:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80276, "2021-02-21T21:21:40Z", [0.15, 0.3, 0.48, 0.05, 0.02], ""], [97501, "2021-02-21T20:07:26Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0], "Rational of @Dustin-MacDonald + Crowd is 19% for 0.5-1 and 80% 1-2,5"], [97892, "2021-02-21T17:47:43Z", [0.0, 0.22, 0.78, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2021-02-21T13:02:42Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [96855, "2021-02-21T09:38:24Z", [0.0, 0.37, 0.59, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [767, "2021-02-21T03:42:04Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [98516, "2021-02-21T03:02:03Z", [0.05, 0.12, 0.8, 0.02, 0.01], "Ada was launched 27 September 2017, it is 1242 days old.

There are 131 days left to predict the price of Ada. Ethereum's closing price from Sep 27 2017 to May 3 2019 was a minimum of $84.31 and a maximum of $1396.42, with a closing price on May 3 of $167.95. We don't have historical data for Dogecoin's entire run, but from Dec 9 2014 to Oct 3 2017 we see a MIN of $0.000087, and a max of $0.003873, closing on Oct 3 at $0.001108. From Oct 1 2017 (again, data limitations) to Feb 19 2021, Ada's price had a MIN of $0.018539, a max of $1.11412, and a Feb 19 close of $0.927649. Graphing the data we see a fairly consistent price from perhaps Dec 2018 to July 2020 when the price starts to uptick again. It's already very close to $1.00 right now, and bigger bubbles have happened, but Ada itself has never been above $1.11 so I suspect it will return there but not go much higher. It also is unlikely to collapse given that it has held its value for several years, but collapsing is more likely than a stratospheric rise. So, 80% that it will increase above $1, 12% that it will stay the same (50 cents and $1 where it is now), 5% that it collapses and falls below 50 cents, 2% chance that it goes between $2.50 and $5.00, and 1% chance that it goes above $5."], [14208, "2021-02-21T00:07:53Z", [0.9, 0.09, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], "Timing"], [691, "2021-02-20T18:57:24Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.93, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [98436, "2021-02-20T16:33:22Z", [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.08, 0.02], ""], [81187, "2021-02-20T02:24:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-02-20T01:25:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-02-20T01:15:07Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [22689, "2021-02-20T01:08:03Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-02-19T19:45:16Z", [0.01, 0.2, 0.73, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [88452, "2021-02-19T19:18:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""]], "open_date": "2021-02-19T18:00:30Z", "close_date": "2021-07-01T07:01:30Z"}
