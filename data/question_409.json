Article Four went neglected throughout the cold war, the most dangerous period of NATO's history. The first time it was called upon was in 2003, when Turkey invoked it to ask the allies for protection from Saddam Hussein during the American invasion of Iraq. Apart from last year, when Poland and Lithuania jointly requested an Article Four consultation after Russia's annexation of Crimea, Turkey seems to be the only country that has ever used it, and may be developing a bit of a habit. Turkey wants NATO to express support for its efforts to combat both IS and the PKK. But while NATO is pleased with Turkey's newfound eagerness to fight IS, it is hesitant about Turkey's aims towards the Kurds.  The Kaliningrad question:\nAfter eastern Ukraine, the next most likely targets for an attempted Russian coercion are in the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  Putin is motivated by several objectives:\n\u2022 To subject the Baltic democracies to various forms of hybrid warfare and to compel them, like Finland during the Cold War, to surrender their foreign relations to Moscow. \n\u2022 To virtually destroy the EU and NATO. Until recently, this claim would be deemed delusional, but today it is plausible as a consequence of Brussels\u2019s mounting difficulties\u2014the euro crisis, Brexit, the unprecedented rush of migrants from the Middle East and Africa to its shores, and the surging power of EU rejectionists. In addition, most NATO members have not met the requirements of the Rome Treaty to spend 2 percent of their GNP on defense. \nFurthermore, President Trump may shower America\u2019s allies with rhetorical support, but Putin believes he will not do anything of substance to sustain the Euro-Atlantic security system. On February 10, Vladimir Putin decreed the maximum state of alert of the Russian air force by ordering his generals to stand on foot of war.

Worried that divided loyalties in its largely Russian-speaking border areas could lay Estonia open to conflicts like those in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Estonia wants to better integrate its Russian speaking minority. Estonia and the other Baltic nations look at Russia's actions in Ukraine and fear they could easily be overrun by their huge neighbor. By reaching out to his country's Russian-speakers, Ratas is hoping to bolster national unity and remove a possible pretext for Russian intervention. So while Ratas is taking language lessons, his new government is trying to make it easier for Russian speakers to obtain Estonian citizenship and to improve the border region's economy, where unemployment is high. Out of a population of 1.3 million in the euro zone and NATO member, about quarter are Russian speakers. Most of those have Russian passports or do not have any citizenship.\nFor a graphic on Russians in Estonia, click tmsnrt.rs/2meQVUw Some security analysts say any grievance amongst Russian speakers that they feel they are \"second-class citizens\" could give the Kremlin a pretext to intervene. Worried since Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea that Moscow could invade Poland or the Baltic states, NATO is bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment. But a perception that U.S. President Donald Trump may prove soft on the Kremlin, combined with fears about \"fake news\" stirring tensions as NATO troops arrive, has caused concern among the Baltic nations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Latvia and Estonia have large Russian-speaking populations, the result of migration when they were under Soviet rule. But only in Estonia has a party with a Russian-speaking electoral base come to power in a ruling coalition (para. 1-10). Scrutton, A. & Mardiste, D.
