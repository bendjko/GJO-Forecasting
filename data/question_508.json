Despite recent votes, the government is stable compared to others in that part of the world.  They are ranked first in some good categories of South Asian countries.  Informally, Bangladesh is an Islamic state and extremist jihadist groups exist.  Both the government and extremist jihadist groups are responsible for kidnappings, deaths and torture.  The Rapid Action Battalion is called a government death squad by some groups and most likely to commit genocide, but the leadership seems to know when to pull back on violent actions.  I believe no armed group from Bangladesh will systematically kill 1,000 or more civilians in Bangladesh.
