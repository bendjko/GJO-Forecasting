I'm updating this forecast to 17% probability to reflect the fact that the Russian elections have already taken place. Navalny's role in the elections as a public leader of the opposition was arguably the greatest threat to the Kremlin. Since the elections passed and Putin was able to secure another 6 years in office without taking major action against Navalny, I argue that the probability of his arrest is dramatically reduced, especially given the short time period remaining in this question. Further, there has not been any recent major news regarding Navalny, indicating that for the time being he does not have the attention of the government. I still predict a minor chance that he will be imprisoned in the next few days because he continues to pose a threat to the Putin administration and frequently stages rallies and protests that often result in run-ins with the police.  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/alexei-navalny-vladimir-putin-russia-rival-detained-ahead-of-election/ "], [691, "2018-03-28T21:59:00Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-28T19:41:09Z", [0.0], ""], [52343, "2018-03-28T18:31:33Z", [0.25], ""], [51593, "2018-03-28T13:44:12Z", [0.85], ""], [38997, "2018-03-28T13:30:07Z", [0.1], ""], [54962, "2018-03-28T08:43:19Z", [0.05], ""], [11080, "2018-03-28T06:13:10Z", [0.1], ""], [23006, "2018-03-28T01:41:01Z", [0.0], ""], [12591, "2018-03-27T20:36:41Z", [0.2], ""], [28414, "2018-03-27T19:48:43Z", [0.03], ""], [12302, "2018-03-27T15:44:18Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2018-03-27T15:44:02Z", [0.15], ""], [172, "2018-03-27T15:36:24Z", [0.01], ""], [28414, "2018-03-27T13:11:59Z", [0.3], ""], [28414, "2018-03-27T13:03:09Z", [0.8], ""], [34821, "2018-03-27T11:37:26Z", [0.07], ""], [33797, "2018-03-27T05:30:58Z", [0.15], ""], [767, "2018-03-27T03:35:04Z", [0.1], "On March 23, Putin appeared in a televised address to thank voters, ask for patience in achieving \"real breakthrough,\" and took a swipe at Navalny by criticizing \"irresponsible populism.\" \nOne of Navalny's activists was detained by police for posting \u201cextremist\u201d memes online this week.

First impressions of Mr. Navlany:  a bit long-winded.  He wants to appeal to young Russians but his speeches use a lot of 'I' and not a lot of 'we' language which doesn't engage. His twitter feed: approx 100,000+ tweets since he joined in October 2009, or  1111 tweets per month. (37 per day or 1.54 an hour) a lot considering he, and his brother/family, have been harassed pretty much constantly since he arrived on scene as opposition. Of course, he might have an army of twitter helpers, and since I don't read Russian, I can't say how many trolling/spammy tweets his account might suffer from. However, for all this activity he's only received 2054 likes.  He has 2+ million followers - not sure what to make of that but in terms of engagement I don't see a lot of back-and-forth with general public. The WSJ plays him up as a big threat but mainstream press (Washington Post notwithstanding - that's a good one) like WSJ, Financial Times, NYT really can't be believed when it comes to news about the Middle East or Russia - too jingoistic and not as solid on-the-ground sources so I'm underweighting their coverage.   Yale-educated seems like a negative, and he seems to prefer things to be 'democratic', or 'democratic nationalism' but it is not clear exactly what he means by this, and his wiki page said mobilizing these movements was not successful. These make me think he would be a question mark, especially to blue-collar union workers.  They might follow him in times of real economic strife as he seems to be the only one willing to, literally, stick his neck out. But I have doubts they would follow him now as Putin is very popular ITO his international policy aggressiveness and even economically there has been some (little) improvement.
