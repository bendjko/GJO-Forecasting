That said the last 48 hours on here are testament to how so many were caught out with the exponential rise in cases in the relatively short period (including me!) and how impactful the UK COVID variant (B.1.1.7) [2] can be on case rates in more relaxed transmission environments. Note a similar rise in cases across the border in Michigan [3] which may play into anyone's forecast on this question's cousin regarding relaxation of US / Canadian travel restrictions [4]. Newly imposed restrictions carry with them the inevitable 2 week lag time for measurable impact on case rate and transmission, meaning the 1.1 million mark in late April 2021 (estimating 24th - 27th April 21 window at this moment with an average of roughly 4750 -5000 over the remaining period) seems to be as certain as anything legitimately can be called at this moment.

The more industrialised Alberta also seems to be having a hard time getting their arms around case numbers (although the nation as a whole is seeing a steady drop in deaths to the credit of their health system) which may be due to a number of local nuances and the greater presence of close in working environments e.g meat packing plants (previously identified hot spots [1]). In short, confidence in the previously projected 2500~3500 a day average over the question period has gone up.

Bearing in mind the 2 week lag in case detection and data tracing, these numbers may get worse before they get better, so the government response to this news will define if and how this may turn into a wider outbreak (see Australia\u2019s response as a comparison of approach).  If, as reporting suggests, this uptick in cases is largely amongst the younger parts of the population then earlier assumptions on a case reduction in the summer time (as per 2020) may be more fragile / less impactful on case numbers.

Always possible for cases to jump back up as well though, but I'm optimistic with vaccine rollout that we won't see another large wave, though smaller waves are possible I think. As a second check, there are 314k cases remaining before hitting 1.1 million, if between now and May 1 (87 days from now) they linearly dropped down to 2k cases per day, that would be 261k additional cases, which would still keep them under 1.1 million.

However, like elsewhere there's a large risk for raging infection waves in long-term care facilities, the 80+ years group thus are the group  with the highest incidence in the population. It seems Canada was able to avoid the worst scenarios and expectations for the time being, but there is plenty of examples where it can go the wrong way pretty quickly (e.g. Rep.

To average below 4k cases per day they would have to have a pretty steady drop over the next month and then hold steady at some number below 4k. With vaccinations starting to ramp up in that time period I think there's a decent chance they're able to avoid another big wave. I think averaging 4k or a little above that is most likely, and I think they're about as likely to average 2k as they are to average well above 6k, so I kind of see those as the limits. As a second check, there are 368k cases remaining before hitting 1.1 million, if between now and May 1 (99 days from now) they linearly dropped down to 2k cases per day, that would be 396k additional cases, putting them over 1.1 million.
