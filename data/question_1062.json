Borrowing is rising much more quickly than budget officials forecast in March as revenue from taxes fails to keep pace with spending, a possible sign that the economic downturn in the second quarter is taking a toll. That\u2019s an unwelcome fiscal inheritance for prime minister Boris Johnson, who has promised \u00a320 billion of tax cuts plus extra money for policing, health care and schools. The public finances could take a further \u00a330 billion hit if he sees through his threat to let Britain crash out of the European Union without a deal on October 31st, forecasters estimate. Years of post-crisis austerity have brought down the deficit from almost 10 per cent of GDP in 2009-10, the highest in peacetime history, to a 17-year low of just 1.1 per cent last year.

Prior to 2013, the UK ratings had been unchanged by any agency for decades [1].  Following the Brexit vote in 2016, all three rating agencies have already downgraded the UK :  S&P and Fitch within days of the referendum vote, while Moody's didn't downgrade until over a year later (useful table and charts here [2]).  Fitch indicated in February 2019 that they might make a change if a \"hard Brexit\" occurs [3]. Given the history, I think it is unlikely that they change their ratings again until the Brexit issue is finally resolved with the EU.  Recently, the UK negotiated an extension on that decision until 31 October 2019, avoiding a hard Brexit. Given the lengthy process with little progress over almost three years, I am skeptical that any progress is made on the Brexit negotiations until closer to that deadline, with some chance that it even gets pushed once again.   So, the core of my forecast is that there will be no Brexit or at least a smooth Brexit before 2020, leading to no further downgrades in ratings.  The chance of a hard Brexit rises as the October deadline approaches with no deal, which would likely cause an immediate downgrade.

For on schedule/delayed and deal or no-deal I estimate:\na) deal Brexit as scheduled: 35%\nb) no-deal brexit as scheduled: 20%\nc) deal Brexit delayed: 30%\nd) no-deal Brexit delayed: 10%\ne) UK revokes announcement to leave EU according to Article 50: 5% With regards to the probability of downgrade, I assumed that in a no-deal scenario, a downgrade is more likely to happen soon after the eventual Brexit date due to increased uncertainty and real negative impact on trade and businesses. In both deal scenarios, I see after 1 January 2020 as the most likely bucket, because the assumption that there will be a deal seems baked into the current rating already.
