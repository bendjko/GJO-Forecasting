My thinking is, once protests of the scale in Belarus start, you can't stop them without a military clampdown. Because they have past the point of no return. If they stop peacefully now the dictatorship will crush them all and they all know it. Hence an irresistible force.  And sure enough, the protests are continuing and show no sign of stopping. But the immovable object is the dictatorship holds all the institutions of power and will not let go. So it ends either in victory or a military clamp down. But if there was no military clamp down now, will there ever be one? Further, events on the street can indeed move quickly.  Is 17 days enough for a successful revolution? It would be nice to study the distribution of time periods between protests and successful resolutions. But I don't have time, so will just assume 5%.

Since he is unlikely to leave the office, tomorrow we should see nationwide strikes in Belarus. I think however that with only less than 17 days left to the end of our forecasted period, the probability of new wave of protests success that fast is very low. Especially since very big demonstrations and strikes were not able to succeed before. I admire courageous people of Belarus who oppose the totalitarian regime, but with the loyalty of the army, KGB and police forces  and the backing form Putin (recent visit of Russian chief of intelligence in Minsk might be another sign of cooperation and support, maybe even preparations for opposition actions) they bravery might not be enough even if the whole country would become a prison and the whole nation would become prisoners.  I believe that unfortunately rivaling security services that mutually control each other will stay loyal to Lukashenko, especially since he has support from Putin and his secret services and military.\nI have previously mentioned \"The House That Lukashenko Built\" by ARTYOM SHRAIBMAN https://carnegie.ru/2018/04/12/house-that-lukashenko-built-foundation-evolution-and-future-of-belarusian-regime-pub-76059 but to study this topic further I have also recently bought short Polish book \"\u0141ukaszenko - dyktator w ko\u0142chozie Bia\u0142oru\u015b\" (Lukashenko, the dictator in kolkhoz Belarus), by journalist Micha\u0142 Kacewicz (printed by Newsweek Poland in 2007).  Here is my amatour translation (supported by Google Translate) of the part of it, that is important to my thinking: \"It has been announced more than once that a conspiracy is being born in the KGB, that the rebel officers together with the Russians will overthrow the president. Just before the elections in March 2006, a letter from the KGB members who had had enough of the president got online. \nMost likely, as with all previous leaks, it was a test balloon, invented by those at the top of the government, or perhaps the president himself, in a multi-layered plot aimed at catching disloyal officers. Because many began to whisper, ask questions and doubted whether Lukashenka's power would last. From that moment on, they came under observation. In six months, a year after the elections, purges shook KGB. Banging on the door in the morning, being dragged out in pajamas and handcuffs by masked commandos of one of the militia services. \nThe mechanism worked. The Interior Ministry and the militia attacked disloyal KGB officers. Already in the Soviet times, the rivalry of various services kept the police state mechanism in constant readiness. Lukashenka built up these structures, turned human ambition, envy, and sheer malice into virtues that fueled the complicated state machinery. \nIn all the scandals and purges in the KGB or police that were publicized afterward, corruption was always officially meant. Heads were flying, there were resignations. There were many such purges in the security service, in fact, they are cyclical, like airing a room.\" The biggest unknown to me was Putin and his plans (what would he do with Lukashenko in the longer term). Recently, one thing made me look at their current relations in what I think is a clearer view. Lukashenko send his youngest son (16 y.o.), Kolya (the one who appeared with the AK-47 with his father during the protests), to the school in Moscow. He would be living in the Belarusian Embassy there but still it reminds me of old times when one lord or a king would be sending a hostage from his family to the other lords capital so that the second one could be sure of the loyalty of the first. This might not be completely adequate comparison but it seem so from the psychological perspective (Lukashenko is said to be a family man who wants to establish his dynasty in Belarus). My view is: Lukashenko is totally dependent of Putin support now, as of now he have to dance to Putin's tune or perish.  I would say it is less than 0.5% so closer to 0% than 1%. pre-mortem: If I am wrong I probably have totally underestimated the influence which opposition can have and overestimated the power of the Putin's support."], [75863, "2020-10-25T22:13:01Z", [0.05], "\"On the final day of what Belarus's opposition has called the 'People's Ultimatum' \u2014 a demand that President Alexander Lukashenko resign or face a nationwide strike \u2014 tens of thousands of protesters marched in Minsk on Sunday before police cracked down with stun grenades ...

See - https://bit.ly/3lKeVwo. Many view Lukashenko's meeting in a jail with some of the jailed opposition as a stalling tactic on his part. However, recent violence against pensioners by security personnel 3 days ago is likely to garner support for the opposition from people who have been wavering in their support for change. The 26th Oct is likely to be a pivotal day for both Lukashenko and the opposition. For the moment, I will keep my forecast as it simply because I do not think Lukashenko will bow to these new demands. Updated 20202011 Although Lukashenko met with some of the jailed opposition in the last 48 hours, (https://bbc.in/2FkaR6B), the chance probability of him resigning and  Tikhanovskaya returning to Belarus in the next 30 days is extremely limited. Some commentators suggest the purpose of the meeting was to calm the long running protestors or possibly even persuade them that change is a foot. Even if change in the election result and / or constitution is likely, it is not likely to be within the time frame of this question. It takes more than a few weeks to arrange another election in the very unlikely event that Lukshenko agrees to step down as the protestors and opposition are demanding. Similar views regarding the reasons Lukashenko likelihood of continuation in office in the next 5-6 weeks - https://politi.co/36T5s1K Updated 20200106 Further evidence and confirmation of Putin's support for Lukashenko, including the strategic reason for Putin's actions - https://bit.ly/3iwqt4w. Unless Lukashenko dies before 23h59 on 11 Nov 2020, it's extremely unlikely he will relinquish his hold on authority. Equally, with the apparent and public support for Lukashenko from Putin, the military and security establishment is likely to remain loyal to Lukashenko for at least the next 6 weeks. It is also apparent that Lukashenko is leveraging Russia's support to remove the figurehead of the opposition and its main participants. Now it is extremely unlikely that Tikhanovskaya can, or will be able to, return to Belarus in the next 5 weeks. See https://bbc.in/34BS3Iv Certainly not while Lukashenko is being supported by Russia and still holding some authority. All this is apparently consolidating his hold on authority. Updated 20200929 Sanctions against Lukashenko and his close allies announced by UK & Canada ( See https://reut.rs/3cEYNt3 & https://reut.rs/3cJcIxW) are unlikely to create sufficient pressure on Lukashenko to resign before on on 11 Nov in my view. Updated 20200925 Russia has criticised the EU in apparent support of Lukaschenko - https://reut.rs/367g2C0. Undoubtedly this will strengthen Lukschenko's resolve to hang on to power. Updated 20200924 Lukaschenko's apparently surprise swearing in and appointment to the office of President yesterday (https://reut.rs/3kzHdcC) further entrenches his position of 'authority' albeit Germany has reaffirmed it does recognise Lukaschenko's position (https://reut.rs/2G4rxPq).  Lukashenko's position appears to be more secure now the EU has not been able to agree sanctions to be imposed on Belarus officials considered responsible for a 'rigged' election and atrocities against peaceful demonstrators. Tikhanovskaya's personal appearance and appeal for sanctions to a gathering of EU foreign ministers was rejected by Cyprus on the basis that Cyprus would not approve unless similar sanctions are applied to Turkey. See: https://abcn.ws/3mDG6u9 & https://bit.ly/2ZV4vSe. The likelihood of EU leaders agreeing to sanction Turkey, a NATO ally and EU member applicant are not high in my opinion. Furthermore. the EU Leaders meeting scheduled for today, 20200924, has been delayed to 1st Oct (https://bbc.in/3csh2le). Thus, in the unlikely event the EU does agree to sanction Luckschenko, the process is likely to take a until the latter part of Oct at best. In reality, Lukaschenko is not likely to feel much pressure from sanctions by any western country or the EU. Hence my revised forecast. Sanctions for 6-8 individuals may be forthcoming from USA, UK, & Canada in the next few days - https://reut.rs/2Hu5Jh3. However, this is unlikely to change Lukaschenko's attitude. Equally, as we know, (https://bit.ly/36bp4h4 & https://reut.rs/3mWTY35) on 14 Sept, Russia's Putin provided Lukaschenko with a US$1.5bn lifeline. What was discussed in private between the two meeting in Sochi and at other times in the last few weeks, we do not know (https://bit.ly/3cyS5ED). However, Russia already has quite deep ties with Belarus and strategically would like to keep the country in its orbit and if possible, with a compliant leader already in place. Lukaschenko fits the bill in that respect. The withdrawal of Russian border forces a few weeks ago was apparently replaced by joint military exercises and the parachuting of commandos into Belarus territory within the last week (https://bit.ly/2EAqYg8 & https://reut.rs/2RXOkz8).

Lukashenko is increasingly playing hardball as his options dwindle. He has invented an imminent attack by Nato to create a national emergency to rescue his faltering position.

ACLED Data globally shows about 1000 protests annually where the government is the target (proxied by \"police force\" in the data, while this annual rate is likely to be much higher because the number of protests without this filter is in tens of thousands). Data on coup d'etat usually show 5-10 events per year (see Wiki). While this is not the only way to change regime, it proxies well 'forceful ousting', which would be the most conceivable way of Lukashenko leaving before November 11 currently. So the quantitative base for Lukashenko being ousted is very low, moving around 1%-5% (with some exaggeration). Accordingly, the \"CoupCast\" predictive tool assessed the August 2020 chance of coup occurring in Belarus to 0.7% (fairly high, comparable to many countries in the global south, but one would still not bet on a \"yes\").  Considering, however, that a) there is the very similar and recent example of Ukraine, b) the intensity of the protests (paralysis of the system with strikes) and their unprecedented size compared to prior Belarussian protests, and, importantly, c) the fact that a coup is not the only way for Lukashenko to cease to be president (I can't quite think of many other options, but that's just me lacking creativity, this should be accounted for as raising the chances of Lukashenko ceasing to be the president). Let's also note here, however, that these are not the first anti-Lukashenko protests, the 2006 and 2011 ones also taking a couple of thousand people out to the streets after the presidential elections (the latter lasted 2 months), and then some more in 2017. The regime might have developed a certain skill to wait these out (the combo of not repressing so violently, while intimidating the leaders for example, or his effort to find the enemy from the outside), and Lukashenko allegedly doesn't show many signs of ceding.  But then again, the protests are huge, and though they may be losing momentum, they still keep the chances far from the 1-5%. The final score is 17%.

Lukashenko says NATO, EU and US are instigating change in Belarus [2].  Lukashenko asked Putin to help. Putin has avoided direct intervention. To me, this says that Putin (who is not the biggest fan of his Belarussian counterpart) knows he cannot plant a coup so has advised Lukashenko to warn of an imaginary foreign interference. This is clever from Putin because it plants the idea into the head of Belarussians that the West is meddling in their affairs / that Moscow is the friendly \"good cop\" / neighbour. If my assumption is correct, it means that Putin wants Lukashenko to stay in power for now.  This combined with the fact that Lukashenko says he will \"solve\" the protests with the army, suggests he is going into full survival mode. The increase in protests shows that the public is not fatiguing and will continue for a long-time to come, which warrants a 5% increase. From now, I will likely revise my judgements from either Russian interferences or military news. Hopefully, there will be some form of military factionalism, which tends to be a regular starter of dictatorship coup d'etat's [3] - realistically, the chances of this are low for now. \n\n[1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/23/lukashenko-vows-to-defend-belarus-borders-as-more-mass-protests-planned\n[2] https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/08/22/belarus-election-protests-lukashenko-pleitgen-pkg-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/around-the-world/\n[3] Zimmerman E. 1979.

As the street protests settle into a routine of daily meetings, the Belarusian crisis moved into a new phase yesterday as the long game starts and the Coordinating Council met for the first time.

They will now have to be shot down with military force. However, the Belarous army seems to have shown signs of refusing orders to attack protesters. On the other hand, media reports of riot police and armed forces dropping their shields and weapons and joining the protests probably focus on a small number of events ignoring the overwhelming trend of the army staying loyal to it's dictator. But the swinger for me is that the dictator has already begun releasing people he has arrested and is sounding apologetic for its violence, a sign pure force alone is not working any more for him. So the army will be unlikely to fire (say 10% chance of shooting).  Suppose the army doesn't fire. The dictator has asked Russia for \"assistance\" and if Putin rolls his tanks into Belarus, they will shoot with probability 100% and there will be blood. However, Russia has never in its history rolled into another country, moed down civilians and left. That's not really how its interventions work. Even with Syria, Russia joined in after a civil war had begun, so there was a team Putin could send his tanks to join. Lukashenko, however, seems isolated with even his base turning against him. Not to mention the extent to which such actions will turn Russia's soft power to dust.  And without any support from people on the ground, once Russia leaves it's people will revolt again, so Russia would need a prolonged occupation. This action would then drive the people of Belarus into the arms of NATO and would amount to completely giving up on any chance of winning over the hearts and minds of the Belarus people making it's eventual escape of Russian orbit inevitable. Not even Ukrainian solutions would then be possible because there would be no pro-Russian areas that it could occupy long term. I would estimate a 5% chance of this. Russia could instead send special forces to lead attacks against the crowd, but would that be enough given the government has already been forced to back down on violence making it much harder to return to the violence route? So I would estimate about 30% chance of Russian (not so) secret forces being used to suppress the protests. The West, crippled by Trump, would do nothing except yet more sanctions on Russia. But this force may not be enough and I would estimate about 50% success rate of such an intervention. Finally, Russia may broker a peaceful resolution, where you get a rerun of the election, or some power sharing or transitional government with Lukashenko remaining president for at least a little longer. I suspect there is about a 20% chance of this outcome. So summing the paths where Lukashenko remains president we get 10% (the Belarus army shoots) + 5% (the Russian army invades) + 0.5 * 30% (Russian special forces suppress the protests) + 20% (Russian brokered deal) = 50% chance Lukashenko remains president by 11 November 2020.  \n"], [28153, "2020-08-18T14:46:52Z", [0.4], ""], [67609, "2020-08-18T14:33:47Z", [0.4], ""], [75863, "2020-08-18T14:25:27Z", [0.4], "\"Former bastions of support for Mr. Lukashenko, like state-owned factories and state-controlled television stations, are now wavering, outraged by a frenzy of police violence last week directed against those protesting the blatantly rigged presidential election ...

However, do the protesters have the stamina to keep on protesting over the coming weeks as well? Current news indicate they wont back down but it remains a volatile situation. What will Putin do? The way Russia will (re)act matters a lot and it is not really clear what will be done. Abstaining from direct intervention does not mean no intervention at all. The coming days and maybe weeks will be decisive. ________ Constant mobilization by large numbers is certainly a necessary condition - and the EU keeping a delicate balance of intervention and non-intervention a sufficient condition - to see Lukashenko leave office. If Putin regards a change in leadership as a threat to Russian influence, it won't happen. Question is, how long can he support Lukashenko without loosing the majority of Belarussian people's sympathies? Is there a way he can make sure, the future leadership of Belarus won't align itself with the neighboring EU member states in the short or medium run if he allows Lukashenko to be ousted?  In general, it seems that letting Lukashenko go is a very dangerous gamble for Russia. That said, as long Putin cannot control the political process and those that'll follow Lukashenko in power, more pressure from the streets is needed to force his hand and Lukashenko's downfall. I can't imagine that Putin will be able to make a trade with opposition leader Tikhanovskaya, e.g. closer alignment to Russia in exchange for Lukashenko being removed. There are obvious reasons Tikhanovskaya has fled to Lithuania and not to Russia in the first place. Her husband protested against deeper integration with Russia [4] before being jailed eventually. So what options does Putin have?  Option 1: He continues to support Lukashenko\n- hopes he'll be able to remain in office (parking position: does not exclude option 2 if protests won't stop)\n- intervenes militarily if necessary (seems he has excluded such an option as it would cost Russia sympathies) Option 2: He deprives Lukashenko of his support.\n- installs a figure friendly towards Russia in the hope, protests will die down (has too be confident that the situation will indeed calm down eventually)\n- makes a deal with the opposition: letting Lukashenko go in exchange for close alignment with Russia (seems unlikely considering current opposition leader Tikhanovskaya's biography) Option 2 poses the risk that Lukashenko will see himself in a position where he has nothing to loose and orders his loyal forces to violently crack down on protesters. This may, however, provide a pretext for Russian forces to intervene and take over control as well. Let's see what the coming days will bring.

This not only shows that the people of Belarus are intent on making a change and willing to fight for it despite reports of the arrests and abuse of protesters, but their prolonged protests are bringing further international attention. 3) Similarly, the news cycle has not yet grown bored of this story which, unfortunately, is surprising but promising for those that want Lukashenko out. More news means more information for everyday citizens, which means more outrage both at home and abroad, which means more pressure on political leaders and dissidents to throw Lukashenko out of office.

But Belarus is not Venezuela. There is no clear leftist ideology and strong anti-imperialistic streak. EU does not look like the US. People want just to live better. And Lukashenko who is playing with both sides, EU and Russia, trying to milk them for his benefit.

So, legislatively, it is virtually impossible to force him to quit the presidency via impeachment or similar means.\nAs for public opinion, polls are heavily regulated, with the most recent ones (2016) leaked to outside news outlets showing an approval lingering around 30%, very low for such a long-serving leader. Moreover, he has blamed these protests on criminals and unemployment, telling people to 'get a job' instead of addressing the electoral fraud questions directly. There also appears to be little to no outside pressure from any foreign power for his resignation, while many foreign authoritarians are voicing their support for him. As such, it is unlikely he will step down due to public or international pressure, as he does not appear to believe the people's support is a priority and has no reason to fear foreign interference.\nSo, that really only leaves a successful assassination attempt.
