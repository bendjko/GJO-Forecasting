Since the Rakhine State riots in 2012, the paramilitary movement in Myanmar has lessened. The NLD earlier this month openly condemned Buddhist extremist groups such as Mabatha and the 969 movement, a commendable approach that will be reflective in its policies and legislation, moving forward. At the root of the problem, as Suu Kyi has repeatedly explained to the international community, is the issue of Rule of Law and proper enforcement. Acts of aggression have been committed on both sides, and the situation of Muslims in Myanmar, though deplorable, does not constitute genocide. Additionally, transforming the ways people view Muslims is inherently difficult, a problem the United States knows all too well, and is not limited to Buddhist nationalist groups and paramilitary organizations.

Since then the country has opened up significantly, but there have been mass killings of Rohingya in the last year or so, while there are several conflicts between the army and various ethnic groups in remote parts of the country. The (hopefully) outgoing military regime has signed peace treaties with most of the ethnic groups, and a democratic government is likely to be more inclusive. The Rohingya problem remains, however, and Aung San Suu Kyi has been notably silent about them, though they expect her to be more helpful to them in power. A transition from military to civilian rule is tricky, especially in Myanmar where internal security will still be in the army's hands. It's quite possible that elements in the military fundamentally opposed to civilian rule may want to make the new government look bad, and even instigate new episodes. There is also the likelihood of repressed minorities revelling in greater freedom, which could end in conflict with more established groups. On the optimistic side, there have been no reports of anything on the scale of 1000 deaths per year, though a hard-line Buddhist monk's movement has been in the forefront of attacking Rohingya villages (this despite original Buddhist philosophy of peace, meditation and non-violence). I am aware of a persistent bias on my part towards optimism, but in this case I'm going to start significantly lower than the current consensus.
