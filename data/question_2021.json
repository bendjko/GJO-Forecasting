A high turnout would benefit the reformist camp and have therefore been excluded from the list of those allowed to run for President.

Moderates tend to win elections in Iran when allowed to run and so hardliners play a game of repressing the most promising political moderate candidates and there is an opinion that this election is not only disqualify rivals but delete their philosophies from the political landscape. Given that six of the candidates are to make up the numbers and the voter will be low Raisi appears to be in pole position. https://www.fes.de/en/referat-naher-mittlerer-osten-und-nordafrika/iran-elections/artikelseite-iranelections/wirtschaftskrise-und-wahlbeteiligung-in-iran  https://www.fes.de/en/referat-naher-mittlerer-osten-und-nordafrika/iran-elections/artikelseite-iranelections/eine-kritische-phase-eine-emiratische-perspektive-auf-die-praesidentschaftswahlen-in-iran  https://www.fes.de/en/referat-naher-mittlerer-osten-und-nordafrika/iran-elections/artikelseite-iranelections/spaetes-crescendo-mit-grossem-finale-wie-in-iran-wahlkampf-gemacht-wird\nhttps://iranintl.com/en/iran/iran-official-poll-shows-lower-turnout-after-elimination-key-candidates  https://iranintl.com/en/iran/qom-clerics-join-criticism-\u2018stage-managed\u2019-iran-presidential-election\nhttps://iranintl.com/en/iran/ahmadinejads-ex-mentor-threatens-irans-disqualified-candidates\nhttps://www.voanews.com/middle-east/iran-presidential-election-feature-7-candidates\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/25/irans-guardian-council-disqualifies-most-presidential-candidates  https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hardline-cleric-ebrahim-raisi-conservative-iran-presidential-election-v6wtwcx8t  https://time.com/6052474/iran-presidential-elections-ebrahim-raisi/  https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/27/iran-election-raisi-larijani-islamic-republics-republic-is-dying/\n"], [45594, "2021-05-30T07:55:39Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.5, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [36274, "2021-05-30T04:39:38Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0, 0.8, 0.15, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [36274, "2021-05-30T04:37:46Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [691, "2021-05-30T00:33:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [94872, "2021-05-30T00:31:52Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.0, 0.01, 0.9, 0.01, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [100409, "2021-05-29T16:56:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [80790, "2021-05-29T08:17:09Z", [0.26, 0.21, 0.03, 0.03, 0.24, 0.03, 0.03, 0.17], ""], [29680, "2021-05-29T04:51:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], "All withdrawals after registration endorsed Raisi.
