As of yesterday, the next two ULA Atlas V rocket launches scheduled (both from the same launchpad, SLC-41) were STP-3 for June 23rd, and OFT-2 (the Starliner launch) for July 30th. But it was just announced today that STP-3 is going to be delayed ( https://twitter.com/ulalaunch/status/1400800541198934017 ). Now, the announced technical reasons for the STP-3 delay do not directly apply to OFT-2, so there's no specific reason to expect this to change the announced OFT-2 schedule. However, there are still two issues to consider: 1) Does the delay eliminate any chance of OFT-2 being moved up, given the pad will likely be used for STP-3 later in June or in early July? Or, conversely, if STP-3 is delayed enough, might OFT-2 actually get put on the pad and launch earlier than previously planned, possibly even in June? 2) Is the technical reason truly unique to the STP-3 configuration, or does it reveal a deeper flaw in Atlas V that would affect OFT-2? Now, my answers are \"There wasn't any chance of moving up before July 1st anyway, and this doesn't change that either way\" and \"It's probably unique\".
