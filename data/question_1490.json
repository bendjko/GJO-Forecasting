OK I did minimal research and apparently the median time from nomination to confirmation since 1975 is 71 days. ACB was nominated 26 Sep 2020, so that gives 97 days until 1 Jan 2021. So the outside view is it is quite likely she would be confirmed in the timeframe. The inside view is that this is an election year and Reps are very motivated to get another Justice in, in case they are voted out. There is a lot of talk about hypocrisy relating to events in 2016 but ultimately there are no laws against hypocrisy, and no mechanism for Dems to enforce any punishments. As far as I can tell, Dems are quite powerless about this. Which means Reps will probably get their way. On top of this, the Rep majority is substantial: 53 plus the VP. So it is pointless for up to 3 Reps to defect, even if they thought it was \"the right thing to do\". They wouldn't change anything, and would fall out with their own party. You'd need at least 4, and are there 4 Senators who are not purely partisan, in either party? I don't follow politics that closely but it feels like the two parties are currently in the bad equilibrium of the iterated prisoners' dilemma and have been for at least 10 years. And even here, the only defections I have read about concern confirming before vs after the election. If I try to think of a reason why Reps would not confirm, I can only come up with something I read a while ago, that Trump himself would not want to confirm before the election, in order to motivate Rep voters to turn out. That was never super convincing, as it would motivate Dem voters equally. And it's looking even more flimsy now. In any case it does not rule out confirming after the election. All the above suggests 90% chance of confirmation, but then again I did little research and I don't know much about this so let's knock it down to 80%."], [48778, "2020-10-14T18:38:54Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [80764, "2020-10-14T18:00:35Z", [0.91, 0.09, 0.0], "Highest priority of the Republicans ever.

That holds the whole thing up until roughly mid-November, still well before this deadline (assuming they'll actually do what they say, which is never better than even money).

This would cut into the R majority, reducing the number of defectors needed for further delay, as long as they haven't already voted. But wait--there's more!  A majority of those voting is required to pass a measure, and an abstention doesn't count as a vote.

It is difficult to see how enough Republicans could be pressured in the correct way to reject or delay a vote in order to appeal to their base.\nHowever, and this is what I am now realizing and others have commented on as well, it doesn't actually matter whether we pressure Republican politicians during the election. Whether they are voted out or kept in, they will still have basically 2 months to ram a nominee through before the next cycle. The only reason I've left 9% on the No is that they technically have until January 20th to push through any lame duck policies if they need to, so it may come through after the 1st.

The main variable is time to replace before the question resolves. Since 1975, median days from nomination to vote is 72.5 with 23.8 days standard deviation. There are 124 days until this question resolves. Assuming that Republicans would fill the seat even if Trump loses the election, that gives plenty of time to fill the seat, a ~90% chance based on time alone. (Note: if you assume that Trump loses and Republicans would not fill it while he's a lame duck, that changes things dramatically, only 45 days until election, a ~13% chance of enough time to confirm. Also note that this is from nomination to vote and there's no one nominated yet and I imagine it would be at least a few days until someone is.) The second variable is that when a vote happens, whether it will be in favor of the nominee. Since 1954, 76% of nominees have been confirmed. Multiplying the above two variables (90% likelihood of enough time to fill seat * 76% chance of being confirmed) gives you a 69% chance of confirming a nomination by Jan 1.

On the whole, my assumptions still hold \u2014 except that I now account for Ruth Bader Ginsburg's cancer recurrence and a probable increase in the eagerness of Senate Republicans to fill a vacancy since Biden is leading in the polls.  I still think this key observation by Richard Wolf of USA TODAY still holds: \"By Labor Day, it would be difficult to get through the normal confirmation process by Election Day. And if Trump fails to win reelection or Republicans lose their Senate majority, it would be hard to justify filling a vacancy in a lame-duck session.\" [2] In other words, if a vacancy were to occur prior to Labor Day (which is on Sept. 7 - so it's about 1 month away), I think it's safe to assume that a replacement Justice will be confirmed by the Senate before Jan. 1 nearly 100% of the time. It gets much more complicated after that. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to a final Senate vote is 69.6 days (~2.3 months) while the median is 69 days [2]. It took 65 days to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by Mitch McConnell's GOP Senate majority [3] \u2014 this is likely indicative of the speed at which such a confirmation process would occur (setting aside the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which was unique due to the sexual assault allegations leveled against him). However, this process might yet be rushed if a vacancy were to open up before the election, given McConnell's general eagerness to confirm conservative Justices. So perhaps there is a ~90% chance of filling a vacancy that occurs between Labor Day and Election Day (~2 months). However, there is maybe only a ~40% chance of filling it between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Jan 1 (there are only 59 days between Election Day and Jan 1!). So, a vacancy will be filled 100% of the time if it were to occur between now and Labor Day, 90% of the time between Labor Day and Election Day, and 40% of the time between Election Day and Jan 1. Combining this analysis (see below) with the probability of a Justice dying as per Social Security actuarial life tables [4], which is now 8-10% (let's say 10% because of RBG's cancer recurrence) due to passage of time (now 5 months instead of 12 months), we get a final result of 7% for bin 1, 3% for bin 2, and 90% for bin 3. Note that I do not factor in the added risk of any of the judges dying from COVID-19 since the Supreme Court is now meeting virtually [5], which I think substantially lowers infection risk. Days between now and Labor Day: 35 \nDays between Labor Day and Election Day: 57 \nDays between Election Day and Jan. 1: 59 \nTotal number of days from now until Jan. 1: 151 Probability of vacancy filled between now and Labor Day: 100% \nProbability of vacancy filled between Labor Day and Election Day: 90% \nProbability of vacancy filled between Election Day and Jan 1: 40% Overall probability of a vacancy being filled between now and Jan 1: [(1*35)+(.90*57)+(.40*59)]/[1*151] = 0.73 = 73%. \n73% of the 0.10 that is left (since we have given bin 3 a 10% chance) gives us ~7% for bin 1 and ~3% for bin 2. One final thing to note: it seems unlikely that Clarence Thomas will retire in the near future \u2014 \"His former clerk Erik Jaffe says activists on the right may try to ease him out before November, to ensure his seat is filled by a young conservative. But, he says, Justice Thomas 'sure as hell is not thinking about retiring.'\" [6].

The Republicans will be bold in the case of an opening in making and approving a new justice if only a very short period remains.

That means, if a justice were to die tomorrow and a replacement was immediately named, it would take until approximately December 11 to confirm a nominee. This rarely happens. Since 1975, it has taken the President an average of 20 days to announce a candidate to fill a Supreme Court vacancy which brings us neatly to December 31, 2020. [2] I think this safely eliminates the confirmation of a replacement before January 1, not to mention the dynamics of COVID-19  and an election year. Let us turn then to the question of whether a seat will be vacated in the first place. The obvious and by far the most likely justice to vacate their seat is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At the age of 87, she remains in vigorous health and will not want to retire as long as Trump is president. This is especially so given her historic longevity. With Biden the front-runner in the presidential race, Ginsburg will do all she can to stay on until the outcome is decided in November. [3][4][5] It is therefore almost certain in my view a Supreme Court seat will not be vacated before 1 January, nor a replacement confirmed. Please comment any thoughts.

These percentages were summed to give a baseline probability of someone dying between now and 1 Jan as 14.373%. Adjustments: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the oldest SCJ) was treated for pancreatic cancer in 2019. She also had lung surgery in 2019 to treat another cancer. Without direct access to statistical information on survival rates post-successful treatment for women her age it is hard to add an accurate modifier, not least because the general population at her age is also likely to already have numerous co-morbidities. Nevertheless if we take a rough guess and suggest it increases her percentage likelihood of dying in the next year by half, that would take her percentage from 9.22% to 13.83%, which would in turn adjust the overall probability of someone dying to 17.06%. This is a necessarily rough adjustment based on partial guess-work. Ordinarily the other major factor to investigate would be retirement, but given the current political climate, proximity to the next US election and general awareness of the contentious nominations of the last two judges, I find it sufficiently unlikely that any one judge would choose to retire in the next 6 months that I haven't bothered to assign a probability. Again another rough assumption, but I'm not a mind-reader. The final part of the question, concerning whether a replacement justice will be confirmed, depends on the baseline minimum time for the president to nominate a candidate and the senate to review & confirm them by vote. There is no hard minimum, but given the Republican-controlled executive and Senate, as well as the recent memory of the Merrick Garland/Neil Gorsuch controversy, it is likely that the President and the Senate will both move as swiftly as possible to guarantee a Republican SCJ before 1 Jan 21. Although Democrats may protest or attempt a filibuster, the change in rules in 2017 mean that that can be defeated by a simple majority. If we (roughly) assume a fastest-case of 2-4 weeks from death of incumbent->nomination->confirmation, then barring some highly unforseen obstruction, it is all-but-certain if it happened today the replacement justice would be confirmed. As it gets closer to Jan, barring any new information the forecasts will change as follows: No = Percentage will increase steadily as no. of days remaining/365 approaches 0. Yes & Replacement = Will steadily decrease as an overall proportion. At about 8-10 weeks out will start to lose in proportion to Yes & no replacement. Yes & No Replacement = Will remain at 1% until 8-10 weeks out, then will steadily increase as a relative proportion of the Yes forcast (while the yes forecast continues to decline steadily overall)."], [79142, "2020-07-10T03:34:42Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [66285, "2020-07-10T00:31:41Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [85984, "2020-07-09T18:55:13Z", [0.35, 0.05, 0.6], "Increasing No percentage as the weeks and months pass "], [73183, "2020-07-09T16:13:25Z", [0.12, 0.03, 0.85], "Age mortality rate https://www.statista.com/statistics/241572/death-rate-by-age-and-sex-in-the-us/ gives roughly 21% chance of one judge dying this year.

"], [75863, "2020-06-26T20:51:11Z", [0.08, 0.04, 0.88], "Updating my analysis from 1 month ago [1]. On the whole, my assumptions still hold. In particular, I think this key observation by Richard Wolf of USA TODAY still holds: \"By Labor Day, it would be difficult to get through the normal confirmation process by Election Day. And if Trump fails to win reelection or Republicans lose their Senate majority, it would be hard to justify filling a vacancy in a lame-duck session.\" [2] In other words, if a vacancy were to occur prior to Labor Day (which is on Sept. 7 - so it's about 2.5 months away), I think it's safe to assume that a replacement Justice will be confirmed by the Senate before Jan. 1 nearly 100% of the time. It gets much more complicated after that. According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to a final Senate vote is 69.6 days (~2.3 months) while the median is 69 days [2]. It took 65 days to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by Mitch McConnell's GOP Senate majority [3] \u2014 this is likely indicative of the speed at which such a confirmation process would occur (setting aside the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which was unique due to the sexual assault allegations leveled against him). However, this process might yet be rushed if a vacancy were to open up before the election, given McConnell's general eagerness to confirm conservative Justices. So perhaps there is a ~80% chance of filling a vacancy that occurs between Labor Day and Election Day (~2 months). However, there is maybe only a ~20% chance of filling it between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Jan 1 (there are only 59 days between Election Day and Jan 1!). So, a vacancy will be filled 100% of the time if it were to occur between now and Labor Day, 80% of the time between Labor Day and Election Day, and 20% of the time between Election Day and Jan 1. Combining this analysis (see below) with the probability of a Justice dying as per Social Security actuarial life tables [4], which is now 10-13% (let's say 12%) due to passage of time (now 6 months instead of 12 months), we get a final result of *% for bin 1, *% for bin 2, and 88% for bin 3. Note that I do not factor in the added risk of any of the judges dying from COVID-19 since the Supreme Court is now meeting virtually [5], which I think substantially lowers infection risk. Days between now and Labor Day: 73\nDays between Labor Day and Election Day: 57 \nDays between Election Day and Jan. 1: 59 \nTotal number of days from now until Jan. 1: 189 Probability of vacancy filled between now and Labor Day: 100% \nProbability of vacancy filled between Labor Day and Election Day: 80% \nProbability of vacancy filled between Election Day and Jan 1: 20% Overall probability of a vacancy being filled between now and Jan 1: [(1*73)+(.80*57)+(.20*59)]/[1*189] = 0.69 = 69%. \n69% of the 0.12 that is left (since we have given bin 3 a 0.88 chance) gives us ~8% for bin 1 and ~4% for bin 2. One final thing to note: it seems unlikely that Clarence Thomas will retire in the near future \u2014 \"His former clerk Erik Jaffe says activists on the right may try to ease him out before November, to ensure his seat is filled by a young conservative. But, he says, Justice Thomas 'sure as hell is not thinking about retiring.'\" [6].

I think that ballparking the likelihood of a death occurring at 25% is fair.  The prospect of retirement would also need to consider potential co-morbidities for the justices' health. RBG, Kagan, and Sotomayor will not resign under the current administration. Beyer, as the oldest male jurist, has i minute likelihood of doing so, say 1%. Thomas, and to a lesser degree Alito, as the oldest conservative jurists,  have a higher likelihood of considering the longer term prospects of a young conservative court, especially considering some of the potential replacements (Amy Coney Barnett), so I would estimate a 3% chance of retirement combined.  Additive, these result in a 29% yes, 71% no dichotomy. As for confirmation by the Senate, McConnell will try to force through a candidate until Adjournment Sine Die, probably Jan 3rd, 2021. Even if beyond the point of a typical nomination process (2 months), I could see a push for an uncontroversial selection (like Erickson, Eve, or Scudder). So the likelihood of no replacement would be only 1%.

These percentages were summed to give a baseline probability of someone dying between now and 1 Jan as 14.373%. Adjustments: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (the oldest SCJ) was treated for pancreatic cancer in 2019. She also had lung surgery in 2019 to treat another cancer. Without direct access to statistical information on survival rates post-successful treatment for women her age it is hard to add an accurate modifier, not least because the general population at her age is also likely to already have numerous co-morbidities. Nevertheless if we take a rough guess and suggest it increases her percentage likelihood of dying in the next year by half, that would take her percentage from 9.22% to 13.83%, which would in turn adjust the overall probability of someone dying to 17.06%. This is a necessarily rough adjustment based on partial guess-work. Ordinarily the other major factor to investigate would be retirement, but given the current political climate, proximity to the next US election and general awareness of the contentious nominations of the last two judges, I find it sufficiently unlikely that any one judge would choose to retire in the next 6 months that I haven't bothered to assign a probability. Again another rough assumption, but I'm not a mind-reader. The final part of the question, concerning whether a replacement justice will be confirmed, depends on the baseline minimum time for the president to nominate a candidate and the senate to review & confirm them by vote. There is no hard minimum, but given the Republican-controlled executive and Senate, as well as the recent memory of the Merrick Garland/Neil Gorsuch controversy, it is likely that the President and the Senate will both move as swiftly as possible to guarantee a Republican SCJ before 1 Jan 21. Although Democrats may protest or attempt a filibuster, the change in rules in 2017 mean that that can be defeated by a simple majority. If we (roughly) assume a fastest-case of 2-4 weeks from death of incumbent->nomination->confirmation, then barring some highly unforseen obstruction, it is all-but-certain if it happened today the replacement justice would be confirmed.  As it gets closer to Jan, barring any new information the forecasts will change as follows: No = Percentage will increase steadily as no. of days remaining/365 approaches 0. Yes & Replacement = Will steadily decrease as an overall proportion. At about 8-10 weeks out will start to lose in proportion to Yes & no replacement. Yes & No Replacement = Will remain at 1% until 8-10 weeks out, then will steadily increase as a relative proportion of the Yes forcast (while the yes forecast continues to decline steadily overall)."], [88452, "2020-06-22T14:48:05Z", [0.27, 0.38, 0.35], ""], [92583, "2020-06-22T12:48:25Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.9], ""], [60948, "2020-06-22T12:01:56Z", [0.06, 0.04, 0.9], "Adjusting for the passage of time."], [92562, "2020-06-22T05:24:58Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "Ruth Bader Ginsburg will not die before this time, before her mission is fulfilled in this life, and she is the key."], [92550, "2020-06-22T02:16:28Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.85], "RBG is gonna wait until election.

In this update I'm increasing the probability of No because of the passage of time and little new news about RBG's health issues.

Key changes in addition to updating for passage of time: I am now assigning an 80% chance (previously 75%) of filling a vacancy that comes up between Labor Day and Election Day, and a 20% chance (previously 0%) of filling a vacancy that comes up between Election Day and Jan 1. I am making these adjustments due to the increasingly partisan dynamics of the U.S. Senate and forecasts that Democrats have a higher chance of taking back the Senate (which will probably motivate the GOP to quickly confirm a conservative justice to fill any vacancy).  Overall, a lot of my assumptions still hold despite COVID-19. In particular, I think this key observation by Richard Wolf of USA TODAY still holds: \"By Labor Day, it would be difficult to get through the normal confirmation process by Election Day. And if Trump fails to win reelection or Republicans lose their Senate majority, it would be hard to justify filling a vacancy in a lame-duck session.\" [2] In other words, if a vacancy were to occur prior to Labor Day (which is on Sept. 7 - so it's about 3.5 months away), I think it's safe to assume that a replacement Justice will be confirmed by the Senate before Jan. 1 nearly 100% of the time. It gets much more complicated after that. According to the Congressional Research Service, the the average number of days from nomination to a final Senate vote is 69.6 days (~2.3 months) while the median is 69 days [2]. It took 65 days to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by Mitch McConnell's GOP Senate majority [3] - this is likely indicative of the speed at which such a confirmation process would occur (setting aside the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which was unique due to the sexual assault allegations leveled against him). However, this process might yet be rushed if a vacancy were to open up before the election, given McConnell's general eagerness to confirm conservative Justices. So perhaps there is a ~80% chance of filling a vacancy that occurs between Labor Day and Election Day (~2 months). However, there is maybe only a ~20% chance of filling it between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Jan 1 (there are only 59 days between Election Day and Jan 1!). So, a vacancy will be filled 100% of the time if it were to occur between now and Labor Day, 80% of the time between Labor Day and Election Day, and 20% of the time between Election Day and Jan 1. Combining this analysis (see below) with the analysis of @smitch15 that shows that the probability of a Justice dying between Jan 1 2020 and Jan 1 2021 is somewhere between 20-25% \u2014 which is now 12-15% (let's say 15%) due to passage of time (now 7 months instead of 12 months) \u2014 we get a final result of 11% for bin 1, 4% for bin 2, and 85% for bin 3.

However, RBG has had significant health problems with multiple rounds of cancer recently. Above that, many of the justices are individuals who are in the \"at- risk\" category for COVID-19, with their ages being over 60. I think the odds that a justice gets significantly sick or worse is high enough that it is possible that a replacement justice will be confirmed.  As to the question of replacement, I think it depends on who ends up vacating the SCOTUS seat. If it is a conservative justice, I think the probability of a replacement being confirmed is far more likely than if a liberal justice vacates the seat, as the election in November has significant impact on which party will control the Senate.  While I don't think that the democrats have a high change of winning the presidential race based on the DNC's presidential nominee, I think that there is a significant possibility that the democrats end up flipping the Senate leading to a moderate candidate on SCOTUS.

The seat would need to be vacated before October to confidently state that the replacement would be confirmed before Jan 1.\nThe Process\nThe President usually will consult with Senators before announcing a nomination. When the President nominates a candidate, the nomination is sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the nominee. The Committee usually takes a month to collect and receive all necessary records, from the FBI and other sources, about the nominee and for the nominee to be prepared for the hearings. During the hearings, witnesses, both supporting and opposing the nomination, present their views. Senators question the nominee on his or her qualifications, judgment, and philosophy. The Judiciary Committee then votes on the nomination and sends its recommendation (that it be confirmed, that it be rejected, or with no recommendation) to the full Senate. The full Senate debates the nomination. The Senate rules used to allow unlimited debate (a practice known as filibustering) and to end the debate, it required the votes of 3/5 of the Senate or 60 senators (known as the cloture vote).  In April 2017, the Senate changed this rule and lowered the required votes to 51 to end debate on Supreme Court nominations (this is commonly known as \"the nuclear option\"). When the debate ends, the Senate votes on the nomination. A simple majority of the Senators present and voting is required for the judicial nominee to be confirmed.

Overall, a lot of my assumptions still hold despite COVID-19. In particular, I think this key observation by Richard Wolf of USA TODAY still holds: \"...By Labor Day, it would be difficult to get through the normal confirmation process by Election Day. And if Trump fails to win reelection or Republicans lose their Senate majority, it would be hard to justify filling a vacancy in a lame-duck session.\" [2] In other words, if a vacancy were to occur prior to Labor Day (which is on Sept. 7 - so it's a little over 4 months away), I think it's safe to assume that a replacement Justice will be confirmed by the Senate before Jan. 1 nearly 100% of the time, even with COVID-19. It gets much more complicated after that. According to the Congressional Research Service, the the average number of days from nomination to a final Senate vote is 69.6 days (~2.3 months) while the median is 69 days [2]. It took 65 days to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by Mitch McConnell's GOP Senate majority [3] - this is likely indicative of the speed at which such a confirmation process would occur (setting aside the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which was unique due to the sexual assault allegations leveled against him). However, this process might yet be rushed if a vacancy were to open up before the election, given McConnell's general eagerness to confirm conservative Justices. So perhaps there is a ~75% chance of filling a vacancy that occurs between Labor Day and Election Day (~2 months). However, there is probably close to a ~0% chance of filling it between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Jan 1 (there are only 59 days between Election Day and Jan 1!). So, a vacancy will be filled 100% of the time if it were to occur between now and Labor Day, 75% of the time between Labor Day and Election Day, and 0% of the time between Election Day and Jan 1. Combining this analysis (see below) with the analysis of @smitch15 that shows that the probability of a Justice dying between Jan 1 2020 and Jan 1 2021 is somewhere between 20-25% \u2014which is now 13-17%,  let's say 16%, due to passage of time (now 8 months instead of a year) \u2014 we get a final result of 11% for bin 1, 5% for bin 2, and 84% for bin 3. Note that I do not factor in the added risk of any of the judges dying from COVID-19 since the Supreme Court is now meeting virtually [4], which I think substantially lowers infection risk. Days between now and Labor Day: 132\nDays between Labor Day and Election Day: 57\nDays between Election Day and Jan. 1: 59\nTotal number of days from now until Jan. 1: 248 Probability of vacancy filled between now and Labor Day: 100%\nProbability of vacancy filled between Labor Day and Election Day: 75%\nProbability of vacancy filled between Election Day and Jan 1: 0% Overall probability of a vacancy being filled between now and Jan 1: [(1*132)+(.75*57)+(0*59)]/[1*248] =.70 = 70%.\n70% of the 0.16 that is left (since we have given bin 3 a 0.84 chance thanks to Smitch15's analysis) gives us ~11% for bin 1 and ~5% for bin 2.

Possibility for some shenanigans post election result if  either Trump wins and RBG just decides she cannot go another 4 years or Trump loses and Clarence Thomas decides to try to allow the lame duck session to replace him.

(since 1791) The current supreme court justices have an average service time of 15 years making this a very interesting question.  According to ssa.gov [2], their average chance of death this year is around 2.5%. Most notably is Ruth Bader Ginsburg with a 9.2% chance going of her age alone. She has fought and beat cancer 4 times (very tough!). Studies show that having cancer does increase the risk of getting it again in the future. However, the amount of information in this area seems to be limited. I believe she will get checked more regularly than most people due to her health history, slightly lowering the risk of death. The current COVID-19 outbreak increases the chances of death for all the members, but it is extremely difficult to put a number on this.

Updating model [1] with two assumption changes that drastically change the calculus here. For full write-up of initial model methodology, see my initial forecast [2]. Assumption change 1: Retirement increases linearly vs exponentially. My initial forecast assumed that as you get close to 90, your likelihood of retiring (voluntarily or involuntarily) hits close to 100%. But, I'm coming around to the idea that there might be some justices who are simply \"lifers\" (like, arguably, RGB) who will simply continue working until they are forcibly removed by health reasons/death. I'm coming around to this idea despite the evidence against the idea of partisanship playing a role in a justice's retirement decision, perhaps because we are in such a partisan time that the historical research here doesn't apply. [3] Assumption change 2: Retirements would happen before the end of the term. I originally forecasted as if a retirement could happen up to the close of this forecast, but looking at the data more, it seems like most justices who retire do so usually in the summer before the end of the term on September 30th. So, I've adjusted the likelihood of a justice's retirement down to time remaining between today and September 30th. These two changes alter my forecast significantly. \nBefore: 75% (yes and confirmed), 24% (yes and not confirmed), 1% (no)\nAfter: 31%, 10%, 59%\nAfter extremizing [4]: 22%, 7%, 71%\nCrowd: 25%, 20%, 55% I give RBG the highest likelihood of leaving at 12% (4% death, 8% retirement), then Breyer at 9% (3% death, 6% retirement), then Thomas at 5% (1% death, 4% retirement). This all seems sort of low to me, but I've had enough days at nearly 100% yes to worth hedging here.

As a result it is the subject of huge political focus with a Conservative / Liberal majority on the Court able to dictate the direction of the US for generations. There are 9 Justices on the Court with Conservatives (Kavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito, Roberts, Thomas) the majority of 5 - 4 to Liberals (Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer, Ginsburg). For this prediction will assume -\n1. Only two methods for a vacancy on the Court, Voluntary (Voluntary Retirement, e.g. Kennedy in 2018) or Involuntary (Death / Extreme Ill Health, .e.g Scalia in 2016). A Justice can be impeached and removed but this has never happened. Additionally assume that Age is an indicator for likelihood for a Justice to leave the Court, i.e. the older you are likelier to create a Voluntary / Involuntary Vacancy. 2. That with the Voluntary method it is timed to allow for their successor to come from their \"side\" of Conservative / Republican or Liberal / Democrat. For example Republican appointed Kennedy retiring in 2018 with Republicans controlling US Senate & White House allowing for a Republican / Conservative successor in Brett Kavanaugh. Therefore in 2020 with Republican control of Senate & White House, thereby controlling the Supreme Court nomination & confirmation process, the only ways of a vacancy occurring are -\nCV = Conservative Vacancy occurring before 1/1/2021 = (Cause: Voluntary or Involuntary)\nLV = Liberal Vacancy occurring before 1/1/2021 = (Cause: Involuntary) V = Vacancy occurring before 1/1/2021 = CV + LV In calculating CV, I calculated it as\u00a0-\nCV Voluntary = 1.8%\u00a0\nThe oldest Conservative, Clarence Thomas is 72, has a number of years on the Court left with the average age of 80 for a Vacancy. Also historically speaking Voluntary Vacancies seem to occur in first 2 years of an Administration, not in a 4th Year. CV Involuntary = 6.25% \nAgain the oldest, Thomas is relatively youthful at 72 compared to the most recent Justice to die, Scalia at 80. CV = 8% = 6.25%\u00a0+ 1.8% In calculating LV, I calculated it as -\nLV Involuntary = 22%\nAs earlier explained, despite a Liberal Vacancy happening only Involuntary given the Republican control of White House & Senate, the advanced\u00a0age of Justice Ginsburg at 87 makes me give a LV occurring a far greater chance than CV. Indeed if Democrats take control of White House & Senate in 2020 I wouldn't be surprised if Justices Breyer and/or Ginsburg were to retire in 2021 - 2022. LV = 22%\n V = 30% = CV\u00a0+ LV Having established\u00a0the likelihood of a Vacancy occurring\u00a0before 1/1/2021, now need to establish the likelihood of the Vacancy being filled -\nThe average length of the confirmation process is approx 80 days, for the Vacancy to be filled there must be enough time for the nomination & confirmation process. Today's date is 28/3/2020, it is 280 days from 1/1/2021. Vacancy occurring and being filled = 21.4% = V * (280 - 80 / 280)\nVacancy occurring and not filled = 8.6% = V * (80 / 280) Given as I previously outlined in the huge importance in the Supreme Court, I will assume that if there is a vacancy Republicans will if possible fill it given they have the numbers in the Senate Judicial Committee, Senate along party lines and control of White House. With regard to the Coronavirus, an additional risk, several of the Justices are in the at-risk category -\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-court/ginsburg-other-justices-healthy-as-u-s-supreme-court-adjusts-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN21736U Using these statistics -\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-51674743 36.5% = Ginsburg(9%)\u00a0+ Breyer(9%)\u00a0+ Thomas(5%)\u00a0+ Alito(5%)\u00a0+ Robert(2.5%)\u00a0+ Sotomayor(2.5%)\u00a0+ Kavanaugh(0.5%)\u00a0+ Gorsuch(0.5%)\u00a0+ Kagan(2.5%) Average the mortality rate = 4% = 36.5% / 9 And assuming the likelihood of contracting Coronavirus at 55% -\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/ I calculate the chance of a Justice contracting and dying from Coronavirus at -\n2.25% = 4% * .55 Given all the Justices would likely have access to excellent healthcare I consider 2.25% a fair estimate of the danger from Coronavirus.

Let's start with retirement. With retirement we are mainly looking at Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. There were some retirement rumors for Clarence Thomas back in June 2019 that he dismissed. Those rumors strike me as implausible, especially since they haven't come to fruition 9 months later. As for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, they are both liberal leaning judges. Given their political leanings, I don't think either of them would leave office while Trump is in office. I won't anticipate the others retiring given the average retirement age of the last 11 justices was 80. Overall, it seems like a retirement will almost certainly not happen. The second possibility is that a justice dies. A few of the justices have had some health problems in the past, which is something to think about. In addition, there is the coronavirus pandemic currently happening. Given the justices are older, they are at greater risk of death of the virus; however, the risk only tops out at around 15% for people over 80, and it is far lower for people in lower age groups. Even if some of the justices contract coronavirus, it is unlikely they will die from it. Furthermore, the supreme court seems to be taking adequate steps to protect justices. Overall, a death seems unlikely. Finally, if a vacancy does occur, I am certain that the Republicans would fill it. What happened in 2016 was solely because Obama was in office. With Trump in office, the Republican-controlled senate will certainly fill it. It's possible a vacancy occurs before January 1, but the senate doesn't get it filled until after January 1.

Listed below are the age and death probabilities within 1 year for the current Supreme Court justices, according to the Social Security actuarial life table for males and females [2].\nRoberts - 65 - 1.58%\nThomas - 71 - 2.53%\nGinsburg \u2013 86 \u2013 8.24%\nBreyer \u2013 81 \u2013 6.39%\nAlito \u2013 69 \u2013 2.12%\nSotomayor \u2013 65 \u2013 0.98%\nKagan \u2013 59 \u2013 0.64%\nGorsuch \u2013 52 \u2013 0.60%\nKavanaugh \u2013 55 \u2013 0.78% The probability of having at least one vacancy due to death is the sum of all their fatality rates (24%).   (Actually there are other terms involving conditional probabilities and product of the individual rates.  Since the fatality rates are small, their products are much smaller than the 24% and therefore they are not considered in this calculation.)   I scaled the 24% for a year to 20% for the remaining 10 months.   Now look at retirement from office.  The potential retirees are the two liberal justices over 80 years old: Ginsburg and Breyer.  Despite having several bouts of cancers, Ginsburg is healthy. She will not retire in a Republican administration.  I give Breyer a small (2%) chance of retiring by the end of this year.  All the others are too young to retire and they will not in this political environment.  This gives a 22% probability of having a vacancy, or 78% for no vacancy.   It takes time to confirm a Supreme Court justice vacancy.  The last two vacancies (Gorsuch and Kavanaugh) took 66 and 90 days.  Lets round this to 2 months.  If a vacancy occurs within 8 months of the 10 months left, it is likely to be confirmed, leading to 0.8*22% = 18% probability.  If the vacancy occurs after 8 months, it is unlikely to be confirmed, leading to 0.2*22%=4% probability. Since the forecast probabilities are time dependent, they will be adjusted over time.

For full write-up of model methodology, see my initial forecast [2]. The main change is that rather than a crude model of assuming 50% retirement in the 4 years after retirement age (74.3), and 100% in the 16 years afterwards, I've plotted the frequency of a justice retiring in a given year relative to all eligible years for justices who have departed the court since 1954. For example, of the 13 justices who have been on the court at the age of 79, three retired during that year, a rate of 23%. Of the 4 justices who have been on the court at the age of 85, two (50%) have retired. The 1 justice still on the court at the age of 90 retired that year (100%). When we create a scatterplot of the frequency relative to each age year (screenshot [3]), we can see an exponential increase in retirement frequency as age increases. The data is definitely noisy, with a very low fit (R2=.065), but the trend looks visually convincing enough and logically it makes sense that retirement likelihood exponentially increases such that by 91.5 years old, a justice is 100% likely to retire in the next year, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. The trendline suggests a higher likelihood of retirement in the upper age ranges than I initially projected. For example, now, the model gives RBG a 48% probability of retiring at her current age of 86, and a 54% chance starting when she turns 87 in March. This is contrary to my previous model estimate of 23%. As detailed in my initial projection [2], I do not account for strategic retirement playing a role in any justice's likelihood of retirement. We should definitely be cautious here of the low sample size that I believe is causing such a low fit to the exponential trendline. Another change I made was to enhance the likelihood of enough time to nominate and replace a justice. Previously, I made a simple linear projection between 50% at the average length of a nomination, 100% for two times the average, and 0% for 0 days for a nomination. I now instead calculate the median length of a nomination (72.5 days), with a standard deviation (23.8 days), to plot the point on a normal distribution relative to the number of days remaining until the forecast ends. This doesn't affect anything now, as there is plenty of time to nominate and replace a justice, but should be better calibrated as we get closer to the average days left. I assume that since Republicans control the Senate and the presidency, they could push through a nominee even after we have 2020 election results in November, even if a Democrat is elected. A third very minor change I made was to see whether the death rates as provided by the actuarial tables I used should be adjusted under an assumption that justices live longer than the average population statistics used for the actuarial tables. I found that when comparing the death ages of male justices who departed the court after 1954, they on average were living only 4% longer than the male data shown in the actuarial table. I applied that death rate \"discount\" to all justices, but it obviously did not make much of a difference. Analysis: The resulting changes dramatically swing the likelihood of a departure this year to 100% (I've set a max of 99% just to not be overly dramatic). Between a 23% chance that any one justice dies plus a 25% chance of retirement based on age for Breyer plus a 48% chance of RBG retiring based on age, that gets you to nearly 100% without even accounting for retirement possibilities by other justices, namely 7% from Thomas. Here's the full new table: Current Projections: Death | Retirement | Health Issue | Retirement Speculation | Total (Adj for Time Left in Forecast)\nJohn Roberts: 2% | 3% | 0% | 0% | 4%\nBrett Kavanaugh: 1% | 1% | 0% | 0% | 1%\nSamuel A.

Final Model Projections: 62%, 20%, 18%\nCrowd: 24%, 22%, 54% Analysis:  My model is significantly more likely to think than the crowd that there will be a departure this year, at an 82% rate vs 38% rate. The discrepancy seems primarily due to significantly higher projections of retirement (59% total vs 23% for death), whether voluntary or involuntary. In particular, given their ages, the model thinks both Breyer and Ginsberg have about a 20% chance of retirement. I think that is about right if one assumes that they will not retire voluntarily, in the hopes of waiting it out until a Democratic president is elected. That said, there is conflicting research over a justice's decision to retire strategically. This paper [4], argues that the political situation, if it has any effect on a justice's decision to retire, has a particularly weak effect, noting as an example RBG's decision not to retire during the Obama presidency among its additional empirical analyses. Because of this, I've chosen not to adjust retirement probability based on political allegiances, especially since retirement could just as easily be due to health decline or similar involuntary circumstance. The NY Times has a good article [7] summarizing this and competing research. Potential improvements to model:\n* Better quantify and account for the weak effect of partisan differences or similarities between the justice and president/Senate\n* Provide more granular death probabilities not simply based on age rounded to nearest whole year\n* Adjust (voluntary?) retirement dropoff significantly if today's date is passed June, when most justices declare their retirement, suggesting low likelihood of retirement until the following June\n* Better analyze historical confirmation rate for differences in rates when the presidency and Senate are run by opposing parties (not applicable for this particular question)\n* Better analyze the dropoff in likelihood in confirmation based on days remaining (i.e. identify standard deviation); make assumptions for what would happen if a presidential election has happened and the results of said election.\n* Generally, replace linear adjustments with normal distribution adjustments or something similarly more robust.

He has vowed to confirm as many federal judges as possible...The only complication for Republicans might be the calendar. By Labor Day, it would be difficult to get through the normal confirmation process by Election Day. And if Trump fails to win reelection or Republicans lose their Senate majority, it would be hard to justify filling a vacancy in a lame-duck session\" [1]. In other words, if a vacancy were to occur prior to Labor Day (which is on Sept. 7 - so it's ~7 months away), I think it's safe to assume that a replacement Justice will be confirmed by the Senate before Jan. 1 nearly 100% of the time. It gets much more complicated after that. According to the Congressional Research Service, the the average number of days from nomination to a final Senate vote is 69.6 days (~2.3 months) while the median is 69 days [2]. It took 65 days to confirm Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by Mitch McConnell's GOP Senate majority [2] - this is likely indicative of the speed at which such a confirmation process would occur (setting aside the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, which was unique due to the sexual assault allegations leveled against him). However, this process might yet be rushed if a vacancy were to open up before the election, given McConnell's general eagerness to confirm conservative Justices. So perhaps there is a ~75% chance of filling a vacancy that occurs between Labor Day and Election Day (~2 months). However, there is probably close to a ~0% chance of filling it between Election Day on Nov. 3 and Jan 1 (there are only 59 days between Election Day and Jan 1!). So, a vacancy will be filled 100% of the time if it were to occur between now and Labor Day, 75% of the time between Labor Day and Election Day, and 0% of the time between Election Day and Jan 1. Combining this analysis (see below) with the analysis of @smitch15 that shows that the probability of a Justice dying between now and Jan 1. is somewhere between 20-25% - I'll say 20% due to the passage of some time - we get a final result of .15 for bin 1, 0.05 for bin 2, and 0.80 for bin 3. Days between now and Labor Day: 207\nDays between Labor Day and Election Day: 57\nDays between Election Day and Jan. 1: 59\nTotal number of days from now until Jan. 1: 323 Probability of vacancy filled between now and Labor Day: 100%\nProbability of vacancy filled between Labor Day and Election Day: 75%\nProbability of vacancy filled between Election Day and Jan 1: 0% Overall probability of a vacancy being filled between now and Jan 1: [(1*207)+(.75*57)+(0*59)]/[1*323] =.77 = 77%. \n77% of the 0.20 that is left (since we have given bin 3 a 0.80 chance thanks to Smitch15's analysis) gives us ~15% for bin 1 and ~5% for bin 2.

Considering a democratic win in the presidential election, the retirement of a democratic judge would have a democratic judge as a consequence all be it with a confirmation after 1 January 2021. I think there is a 19% chance of retirement of one of the democratic judges around December (for the second bucket, yes but no)\nUsing life expectancy as the next argument, I think there is a 61% (81% no retirement * 75% chance of all living) that the SC bench will not change and a 15% chance that a new judge will be confirmed by the senate before 1/1 (3/4 chance of 20% chance of a non-retired judge passing in the coming year).\nI estimate another 5% chance that an unfortunate passing falls so late in the year that the Senate does not manage to confirm a new judge before the 1/1."], [8826, "2020-01-22T15:27:35Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [49779, "2020-01-22T15:17:01Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [84362, "2020-01-22T14:35:27Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], "Confirmation hearing will be long and controversial.

There are 5 conservative justices and 4 liberal justices [1]. Given Trump or at least a Republican will be the president until January 2021, the only way a liberal justice's seat is vacated is by death. Using an actuarial life table [2] we can compute this for the liberal justices. RBG is 86, Breyer is 81, Sotomayor is 65, and Kagan is 59. The probability of at least one of them dying is .082 + .06 + .01 + .005 = 16%. We can compute the same probability for the conservative justices. Roberts is 64, Thomas is 71, Alito is 69, Gorusch is 52 and Kavanaugh is 54. The implied probability of at least one death then is: .025 + .02 + .015 + .006 + .007 = 7%. This gives about a 20-25%  chance of a chair being vacated because a judge dies. Given that RBG also has a history of cancer scares maybe that probability should be a little higher. In addition, death isn't necessary, they may vacate if they become sufficiently sick. Hence, I will give a 30% chance that a judge dies this year, which implies a 70% chance of No.  Another factor to consider is that conservative justices may retire. It is hard to speculate about this. Given that all of these justices are relatively young, I would say that is highly unlikely. The average age of retirement is 73 [3] and given the controversy sparked by the fight over whether scalia's seat could be replaced during the last term of a presidential candidate year, I think the judges will try to avoid retiring this year. They all place a high value on the view of the court as an independent, authoritative body and another fight regarding a justice's retirement would only hurt that. Given that all of the conservative justices are young enough that they very well will see another conservative president after Trump if he loses I don't think they will retire. Hence, I'll say this will not occur. Since I say there is a 30% chance of a justice dying, I'll say 70% chance of No. I have a much less well developed view of the conditional probability of what happens if a vacancy occurs. I think the most likely outcome is that conservatives rapidly fill it. I do not know to what extent democrats can stall the proceedings since they do not have a majority in the senate. Hence, I'll put most of my weight in the replacement will be confirmed.  If anyone has any more information about the proceedings surrounding replacing a justice, I would be happy to hear.

That gives a mean of 73 days and a max of 99, with most above the mean.\nLet's keep it simple and say if someone dies in the first 9 months of the year they get replaced before year end, otherwise it runs over into next year. So the probability of losing a justice gets further split 75% replacement - 25% no replacement.\nI've gone for a 30% chance of someone dying, which breaks down as:\n23% vacancy with replacement\n7% vacancy with no replacement\n70% no vacancy\nI may update if more info comes in about anyone's health, or reasons to step down other than dying which I haven't considered here."], [84109, "2020-01-20T16:09:34Z", [0.55, 0.3, 0.15], ""], [75093, "2020-01-20T16:05:27Z", [0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [81809, "2020-01-20T16:02:01Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85], "Ruth Bader GInsberg, please live forever."], [84095, "2020-01-20T15:30:49Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], "The progressive Justices will continue on a respirator if need be, until Trump leaves office.\n"], [84098, "2020-01-20T15:30:24Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [73707, "2020-01-20T15:28:34Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.65], "The Democrats are desperate, and will do everything they humanly can to keep liberal justices on the Court or (if one dies), to delay confirmation hearings.
