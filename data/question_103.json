Reversing that growing threat must be a greater United States priority.  This test, its largest to date, combined with a number of recent ballistic missile tests, should also lead the United States and its partners to accept that North Korea can strike its neighbors with nuclear weapons and is making progress on building a long-range nuclear-capable force. Although we share the assessment that North Korea will likely need several more years before it can deploy a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can strike the United States, North Korea appears embarked on a path to succeed in that endeavor.  Diplomatic efforts so far have proven inadequate to stop North Korea\u2019s progress. However, when agreements were reached, they improved transparency over North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs, slowed its progress, and led to fewer regional provocations by the regime. In short, negotiating with North Korea is a strategy that can yield both short and long term gains. The United States needs to reinvigorate its efforts to seek the dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal. With regards to that endeavor, it has to be recognized that China is not going to deliver North Korea\u2019s denuclearization. Unless China dramatically changes its current policies, it is not going to institute sanctions or other measures that it views as risking the collapse of the North Korean regime. Although we support increasing pressure on China to apply more effective sanctions on North Korea, the United States cannot rely on China to press hard enough to get North Korea to make significant nuclear concessions. The United States needs to find additional ways to influence North Korea, including direct negotiations (para 1-3). Albright, D. (2016).

Grisafi  Ri Yong Ho was appointed Foreign Minister of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea) according to a diplomatic note from the DPRK embassy in London to the government of the United Kingdom, dated May 16. Until now, Ri Yong Ho (not to be confused with the other Ri Yong Ho, a senior officer of the Korean People\u2019s Army who was removed from all posts in 2012) has served as a vice minister in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as Pyongyang\u2019s point man on nuclear negotiations such as the Six-Party Talks. Ri has at least 38 years of experience in foreign affairs and diplomacy. He majored in English as the Pyongyang University of Foreign Language. Afterward, he held numerous posts within the DPRK Foreign Ministry, first working as policy staff from 1978-79, then as a secretary at the embassies in Zimbabwe from 1979-85 and then Sweden from 1985-88, and then returning to North Korea to work in the Ministry\u2019s Bureau of International Organizations from 1988-95. From 1995 to 2000 he held the title of councilor and then from 2000 was considered an ambassador-at-large. According to the recent diplomatic note, Ri has also previously served as DPRK ambassador to the United Kingdom. This is may have been from 2003 to 2007, when he is known to have been titled ambassador while serving abroad. From 2007, Ri held the title of \u201ccouncilor and negotiator\u201d and was promoted to vice minister of Foreign Affairs in 2010. That same year he was made an alternate member of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea Central Committee (WPK CC). In 2011, Ri was made chief representative to the Six-Party Talks, succeeding Kim Kye Gwan. He was recently made a full member of the WPK CC and an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK CC at the conclusion of the Seventh Congress of the WPK on May 10. Ri also has much experience negotiating the North Korean nuclear issue and dealing with the United States and the other members of the Six-Party Talks (South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia). He participated in talks with the U.S. regarding Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program beginning in 1995 and even visited the U.S. in 2000 with First Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission Jo Myong Rok. He has been considered one of the leading men in Pyongyang regarding nuclear talks and has met with counterparts from other countries, such as China\u2019s Wu Dawei, numerous times. The elevation of a diplomat with so much experience on the nuclear issue and with the members of the Six-Party Talks (as well as the United Kingdom) may indicate a policy focus in Pyongyang. North Korea likely recognizes the nuclear issue and its relations with the U.S. as priorities in its foreign policy and consequently appointed the man with most relevant experience.

Ri Su Yong was made a full member of the Political Bureau of the WPK CC, a vice chairman of the WPK CC and member of its Executive Policy Bureau at the Seventh Congress in May. This means that Ri Su Yong has not been demoted but is likely moving on to new roles within the North Korean leadership regime. The author, John G.

Not even to negotiate a formal peace treaty to end the Korean Conflict, as China is proposing.   Why do I think Kim wouldn't participate in negotiations for peace?  Because he and his predecessors have created a narrative and budget built around the idea that DPRK is under a tremendous external military threat.  He has not promised his people peace; he has promised that DPRK will be victorious if attacked!  He'd not be interested in peace because that would make all of the investment in nuclear weapons wasted; it would be domestically de-stabilizing.

This suggests China has deemed it necessary to listen more to North Korea if the aim is to prevent any further nuclear tests and rocket launches and get the six-party talks started again.\n\u3000\n\"So far, Seoul has been dismissive of Wang\u2019s proposal.  . . .\u201d The US has yet to give any official response - but it is worth noting that it has not dismissed the proposal out of hand. \"For its part, the Chinese government doesn\u2019t appear to be expecting an immediate positive response from South Korea or the US.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Feb 23: \"Resuming The Six-Party Talks?: Bleak Prospects \u2013 Analysis\" --> http://www.eurasiareview.com/23022016-resuming-the-six-party-talks-bleak-prospects-analysis/ Multilateral negotiations, known as the Six-Party Talks among the US, China, Japan, Russia, North and South Korea have been stalled since 2009 when Pyongyang walked out of the talks in response to condemnation from the UN over a rocket launch. Since then, Pyongyang has revised its constitution in 2012 to proclaim itself a nuclear state. However, the relative success of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal, whereby the Iranian nuclear programme is temporarily halted in exchange for gradual lifting of sanctions on the country, may give rise to some optimism for the relevant stakeholders to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis in a similar fashion. Nevertheless, the resumption of the Six-Party Talks is highly unlikely because of the diametrically opposed preconditions attached by the stakeholders. The US wants North Korea to return to the talks and commit to denuclearisation before the removal of sanctions and a peace treaty could be on the table; Pyongyang wants the sanctions to be first removed and a peace treaty negotiated before it is willing to return to the talks. Even if China can persuade all the major stakeholders to reach a compromise and return to the talks, it will only deescalate regional tensions temporarily as it is almost impossible that Pyongyang will ever agree to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The North Korean regime has followed a military-first policy since former leader, Kim Jong-Il\u2019s reign, placing a special emphasis on the development of nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles. Unlike Iran which does not have sufficient fissile material stockpiles to create a nuclear weapon, Pyongyang has already obtained several nuclear weapons and declared itself a nuclear power. Its nuclear arsenal is seen as the security guarantee and an effective bargaining chip to achieve the regime\u2019s political goals. Also, while the Iranian government depends heavily on energy exports, welcomes foreign investments, and faces significant pressure from its people to end its decades of international isolation, North Korea is a lot more autarkic and less reliant on foreign trade and access to the international financial system. China\u2019s Dilemma In fact, being its only ally, its largest trading partner, as well as its main source of food and energy, China is the only country that has any degree of influence over the hermit kingdom. If China has the political will to punish North Korea for its belligerent behaviour, it certainly can do so. Realistically, Beijing has two options. First, it can continue to insulate North Korea from the international community and learn to live with a nuclear armed ally and in the process, lose its recent budding friendship with South Korea and be confronted with a potential regional arms race in the future. Second, China can choose to cooperate with the rest of the international community to rein North Korea in with tough actions, but potentially losing its influence over the regime. Despite displaying increasing annoyance with North Korea\u2019s decisions, it is more likely that China will continue to endure its neighbour\u2019s provocations. China has traditionally seen North Korea as a buffer zone and hence, it is not in its immediate interests to allow the collapse of the Kim regime as this may result in a unified Korea that is democratic and pro-US. Also, the collapse of the North Korean regime would lead to a refugee crisis on China\u2019s borders, potentially triggering economic and social chaos. Tough Road Ahead Nonetheless, getting China on board may not be a lost cause yet. There are signs that China is already gradually losing its influence over North Korea. Kim Jong-Un\u2019s unexpected execution in 2013 of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, who was regarded as pro-Beijing, has raised its concerns over the hermit kingdom\u2019s unpredictability. Furthermore, when China sent a diplomat, Wu Dawei in early February to dissuade Pyongyang from the rocket launch, it went unheeded and the latter even brought forward the launch to the Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve, a major Chinese holiday. This is perceived by some analysts as a sign of disrespect, and there may be a limit to China\u2019s patience if its advice continues to be ignored. In fact, Kim Jong-Un has already expressed his intention to launch more satellites into space. Thus, even though it would be an extremely challenging task, the US and its allies may still be able to persuade Beijing to wield the stick eventually. ~~~ COMMENT: Doesn't sound promising for a resumption of talks anytime soon."], [2965, "2016-02-24T00:29:15Z", [0.1], "Extrmely unlikely.\nChina wants as a way to defer.\nUS must  consider Yang position announced today.\nhttp://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/02/253164.htm "], [13657, "2016-02-23T23:04:08Z", [0.01], "I am extremely skeptical of comments that the Obama Administration has tried to reach out to N.

Wu Dawei, China's special representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs, is the first high-ranking Beijing envoy to visit Pyongyang since Jan. 6, when North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test, Yonhap reported. The Chinese diplomat flew to Pyongyang and arrived Tuesday afternoon, local time, Kyodo News reported. Pak Song Il, deputy director of the America department at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, greeted him at Pyongyang's Sunan International Airport upon his arrival. Both North Korea state media and Chinese officials in Beijing confirmed the visit. A spokesman at China's Foreign Ministry told Yonhap that \"Representative Wu is staying in Pyongyang,\" and that he is expected to \"exchange views on the current situation with North Korea.\" The visit marks Wu's first trip to Pyongyang in nearly two years, and the envoy is expected to meet with Kim Gye Kwan, first vice foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's chief representative to the six-party talks on denuclearization and other senior North Korean officials.\n[...]\nIn Pyongyang, Wu is likely to present the outcome of U.S.-China discussions with North Korea officials. ~~~ COMMENT: NK is famously enigmatic in its behavio[u]r, so on the possibility that China wrangles someone from NK to join six party talks, I'm raising this one for at least a little while."], [877, "2016-02-02T17:39:49Z", [0.25], ""], [13195, "2016-02-01T22:39:32Z", [0.05], ""], [16272, "2016-02-01T18:15:45Z", [0.62], ""], [691, "2016-02-01T17:27:25Z", [0.28], ""], [498, "2016-02-01T16:01:19Z", [0.06], ""], [14414, "2016-02-01T15:25:40Z", [0.1], ""], [16682, "2016-02-01T15:16:20Z", [0.65], "happens every few years with the regime needs food or money,  China will strongly encourage North Korea to engage"], [18114, "2016-02-01T05:05:58Z", [0.03], ""], [16886, "2016-02-01T00:25:28Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-01-31T15:43:26Z", [0.28], ""], [1056, "2016-01-31T04:06:17Z", [0.05], ""], [231, "2016-01-30T22:06:24Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-01-30T14:33:06Z", [0.27], ""], [18196, "2016-01-30T12:47:15Z", [0.0], ""], [3702, "2016-01-30T02:31:29Z", [0.28], ""], [368, "2016-01-29T22:54:39Z", [0.0], ""], [1529, "2016-01-29T20:49:46Z", [0.15], ""], [823, "2016-01-29T18:20:48Z", [0.15], ""], [18084, "2016-01-29T16:04:03Z", [0.7], ""], [766, "2016-01-29T15:03:21Z", [0.15], ""], [18045, "2016-01-29T14:58:47Z", [0.68], "Due to recent nuclear tests, China will likely reduce trade with North Korea; as it represents about 60-80% of GDP."], [691, "2016-01-29T13:45:01Z", [0.28], ""], [13364, "2016-01-29T12:00:06Z", [0.58], ""], [18056, "2016-01-29T08:42:13Z", [0.1], ""], [1547, "2016-01-29T02:18:53Z", [0.05], "There are too many other issues or crisis', both global and internal to the 6 parties.

Looking at news regarding Kim Yong Chol's alleged new job.  One of Kim Jong Un's brothers, Gen. Kim Yong Chol, allegedly is now in charge of inter-Korean relations. He is the oldest child of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il with his fourth wife Ko Yong Hui, born 25 September 1981; was head of North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, and recently was, apparently, transferred to the United Front Department. This could mean nothing, or it could hint at a HUGE BIG DEAL. This could mean scheming and plotting by forces opposed to Kim Jong Un, suggesting increasing instability; or it could mean a hardening line against the outside world. Or both, or neither. I really don't know what to make of this right now other than to slightly reduce the likelihood of six-party talks. Dateline 1-19-16 Following South Korean media reports that North Korea\u2019s General Reconnaissance Bureau Chief Kim Yong Chol has been tapped to fill a vacant post dealing with inter-Korean relations, Daily NK has learned from a source within the North that Kim has been transferred to this position although not officially appointed. This news strongly indicates that Kim, who has a more hawkish view toward the South, will imminently be appointed as director of the Central Party\u2019s United Front Department.  \u201cKim Yong Chol, who until not so long ago was heading the reconnaissance bureau, has suddenly been transferred to the Party\u2019s United Front Department,\u201d the source from South Pyongan Province told Daily NK in a telephone conversation on Monday. \u201cAfter (the former director) Kim Yang Gon\u2019s sudden death, Kim Yong Chol took over his work, and although it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, he is effectively acting as the department director.\u201d  This news was corroborated by an additional source in the same province.  Kim Yong Chol has never worked in the Central Party and is a military official \u201cto the core,\u201dbut has been involved in inter-Korean relations ever since he led the North Korean delegation for high-level cross-border talks (back in 2004), according to the source. http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=13702&cataId=nk01500"], [15968, "2016-01-19T14:24:17Z", [0.05], ""], [61, "2016-01-19T03:38:28Z", [0.09], ""], [15919, "2016-01-19T02:56:50Z", [0.2], ""], [15413, "2016-01-19T00:16:42Z", [0.05], ""], [5034, "2016-01-18T22:16:54Z", [0.15], "Before six party talks can resume, there should be some semblance of diplomatic activity. I see none at this time. From 2003-2009, six-party talks went back and forth with no final agreement.  In 2014, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated that North Korea wanted to resume talks. However, 2015 brought no movement towards the resumption of talks. \nOutside view: When talks were happening, the average was about 1 round per year for 6 years (2003-2009). Total of 6 rounds. But there have been zero rounds in the last 6 years. The numbers indicate another round is due. Based on this reasoning, I'd estimate 30% for resumption by year end. \nInside view: However, the difference in leadership since the last talks and the recent nuclear test make resumption of talks seem less imminent. In addition, the complicated relationships between the U.S, China and Russia make things harder still.  In terms of domestic politics, it's not clear how much diplomacy the Obama administration is willing to devote to this issue in the last year of power. Although if there is to be any significant impact of the 'pivot toward Asia' one might be tempted to think that Obama's team would be pursuing some progress on North Korea. Still, these things would have to happen early in the year for talks to get underway in time for some kind of new framework. I'm estimating these thoughts are worth about a minus 15 (-15).

Perhaps the most important/crucial of these members, the United States, has a leader that has seemingly not made them a priority. Given the limited time he has left, and his stated priorities, this seems unlikely to change.   This also seems to be true of Russia. Vladimir Putin seems to be quite preoccupied with Syria and ME events generally. I couldn\u2019t find any statements of him wanting to restart talks in the near future.  Also, Ukraine, and especially the now persistent drop in oil prices, would also seem to have significant potential to disincentivize moving the six party talks up their priority list.  Another factor is just the baseline data that suggests that in any given year the resumption of six party talks is likely to resume. There have been roughly fourteen twelve month periods since initial talks ended. They have been restarted 5 times for a crude average of 35% chance over that period. Given how long talks have been off, I adjusted the probability down an admittedly somewhat arbitrary fifteen percentage points. Part of this is taking into account the fact that they may never resume in the six party format.  I then assumed South Korea and Japan could be pressured to (or would want to anyway) participate at more or less any time. I also assumed China, based on past statements, would generally be receptive to any serious overtures to restarting talks . That means the only real impediments are North Korea, Russia and the USA.  I put a probability of North Korea wanting to resume talks at 50% because I do not know how to assess the odds very well. I put a probability of it being made a priority by the USA at 5% and by Russia at 10%. The difference here is accounted for by the mere fact that the USA has an upcoming presidential election and Obama seems to have other priorities.   So, I started with a baseline of a 20% chance of talks restarting in any given year. I put the combined probability of the North Korea, Russia and the USA wanting to restart talks in the next twelve months at around 22%. I then assigned 50% weight to both the baseline data and the participants specifically.

If it doesn't feel the need to come to the table to negotiate, it won't. And I don't get the sense that N. Korea is willing to negotiate at the moment. As others have pointed out, the North is rumored to be preparing for nuclear tests again.  2) Out of all the other parties involved, China has the most influence over North Korea, as it is North Korea's key lifeline for food and other goods. In the past, China has been reluctant to push North Korea too hard for fear creating instability along its border. While this concern probably remains, Chinese-N. Korean relations have soured of late, so China may be willing to go further than usual to press the North Koreans into coming to the table.  3) North Korea's behavior is somewhat unpredictable (and often intentionally so).

Obama would try to restart these kinds of talks given that they're likely to spill into the next administration. I would add a third point to that -- given the current animosity between Russia and the US, do we really think that they're going to sit down together for talks like these?
