This is before any data revisions.\u00a0 I think this question - like the TSA one that also closes this week but is in effect already resolved - could go either way.

Looking at the daily data over the past few months, this is far more likely due to low testing turnout over the weekend (as the weekends over the past two months show much lower new cases than mid-week) rather than a downward trend in case numbers.

I would guess the recent wave will probably confer some protective effect that will slow infection rates of BA.2.\u00a0 However, masking is at its lowest rate in the US to date and almost all of the cities and counties that extended or reimposed mask orders amid last summer's delta variant surge and the emergence of the omicron variant in late 2021 have dropped those rules as the omicron wave subsides. The federal government's nationwide mask order for public transit, commercial flights and transportation hubs such as airports and train stations was struck down by a federal judge April 18 and it has stopped being enforced.
