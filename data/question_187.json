AFAIK, conditions are very close: the subsidies are still there (though it looks they go down 20% on average each year) and will be till 2020 AND the government affirms its policy of further support for the industry even after recent scandals (see below). (I encourage reading a recent article about the subsidies and government policies from CAAM site (in Chinese) using Google Translate: http://www.caam.org.cn/zhengceyanjiu/20161121/1005201237.html ) For example, China halved the purchase tax for car buyers and this will expire in 2017. On the other hand, a slump in sales was predicted because of the government investigation into fraud allegations on subsidies and in September \"the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers revised downward its estimate for this year\u2019s new energy vehicle orders to 400,000 from 700,000, Xu Haidong, assistant general secretary with the government-backed group, said at a media briefing in Beijing\" http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2018663/chinese-auto-group-slashes-new-energy-vehicle-forecast-wake In China, it is not individual buyers who get subsidies, it is the car manufacturers. And the latter billed the government for unsold or even not produced yet vehicles. Of course, CAAM may have reasons to low-ball future sales to scare the government to back off from deepening of the fraud investigation - the government has quite high goals of electric vehicles sales. And CAAM numbers do not look real \u2013 (400,000 \u2013 337,000=) 63,000 vehicles to sell in the last 2 months are just 15.8% from 400K (if sales were even through the year, it would be 100/6 = 16.7%). They sold many more in the previous two months of September and October - 93,000 (using CAAM numbers)! Most probably, the sales will have a bump at the end of the year as in 2015.

Up until 31 Dec 2015 subsidies for e.g. buses could be large enough to pay for the whole bus, whereas from 1 Jan 2016 they fell to less than half that. CAAM has released Aug & Sep 2016 stats (finally) and monthly sales remain in the high 30 - low 40 thousand range. So far in 2016 fewer than 290k NEV have been sold, which leaves 3 months to make up 210k, i.e. 70k per month, nearly twice sales of any other month. With ongoing subsidy fraud investigations, highly visible punishment of defrauders, and much lower subsidies, 2015's end-year bump simply will not happen again.

There is discussion about what to do with incentives and possible new policy.  I think the lack of NEV sales data on both the Mandarin and English sites reflects bad news for NEV.

Lets say China does not produce 500K EVs how would they save face?  Perhaps the VW recent history with cheating American VW owners will give China an out?

Perhaps President Obamas humility saved the relationship between U.S. companies and Chinese companies b/c TPP may not become a reality this year.

Graphing the quarterly sales since 2014 (all from the CAAM news releases) yields some statistics and a working hypothesis as to how this data series has been behaving:\n- There has been very strong growth, geometrically averaged 36% quarterly.\n- Q4 has been huge in both 2015 and 2014. Q4 saw 59% of 2015's sales and 50% of 2014's sales. In both cases sales in Q1 following contracted fairly sharply. (28% and 70% respectively). The best explanation I can imagine is that the bumps reflect pending reduction/elimination of government incentives. I need to learn more about these if I can.\n- The target of 500k units will be hit if 30% quarterly growth is achieved through Q3-Q4. The Q4 upward bumps of years past historical growth suggests it is more likely than not to happen. 2 scenarios for now then to grasp at a statistically based probability: 1) No bump in Q4 2016\nI'll assume that from now until the end of 2016 the growth rates will resemble Q2 and Q3 growth rates from the past 2 years. Using a crude mean ~62% and standard deviation ~30% (quarterly) suggests that the target is around 1.3 standard errors below projection. If the growth rates were from a normal distribution (and they are not but hey) this would be a 90% yes. 2) Expecting some sort of bump like the last 2 years.\nSame rough and ready analysis as scenario 1, but now the 'distribution' has average growth of ~80% and standard deviation ~60% quarterly. (The standard deviation is higher in part because there are fewer data points to work with.) Now we end up with ~1.1 standard errors for an 86% yes. (SURPRISE! Slightly lower!) Now some qualitative factors that may justify adjustments at some stage:  \n- Geometric growth of this magnitude becomes unsustainable very quickly. (Don't care what the underlying process is.) It's one thing to go from 0.01% of autos sold to 0.1%, quite another to go from 1% to 10%, even though the ratios are about the same. Even so, knocking 10% off the growth rates of the scenarios above still gives 82% yes. I'll split the difference. - China appears to be at risk of financial collapse. Might not be good for auto sales generally. China could also experience an economic surge off the back of a strengthening US economy. I am too torn on the question to make an adjustment for the China macro economy.  (Sorry to anyone swayed by my earlier estimate. Diving into the data a little harder altered my view.) \n "], [691, "2016-07-04T20:50:17Z", [0.81], ""], [4462, "2016-07-04T13:11:18Z", [0.85], "Yes"], [231, "2016-07-03T21:53:17Z", [0.65], ""], [26762, "2016-07-03T13:40:14Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2016-07-02T19:46:12Z", [0.81], ""], [14208, "2016-07-02T07:18:24Z", [0.9], " http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/271939"], [691, "2016-07-01T20:07:58Z", [0.81], ""], [22243, "2016-07-01T16:48:46Z", [0.78], ""], [484, "2016-07-01T16:24:33Z", [0.9], "Up 35% on this: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/271939"], [68, "2016-07-01T13:11:29Z", [0.9], "Correcting forecast error.

(Will look into this for the next estimate) As you can see, these numbers are a lot larger than the 500,000 that we are aiming for but the EV market is growing and is a small percentage of the total vehicle sales in China. In 2015, the EV market was only 1.4% of the total vehicle market. So what would be the estimate for 2016.  It looks like the number of cars produced in 2016 should be around 27.5 million from extrapolating the graph. If it does increase by this amount, then the increase will be 11%. The number of electric cars produced at the same proportion will be: 1.11 *331000 = 367410 cars.\n0.014 * 27.5M = 385000 cars 14% does not look like it reflects recent economic development levels from 2012. So from this estimate, it does not seem likely that there will be 500000 cars produced in 2016. This is an overall economic base view. Maybe the political initiatives can push EV specific sales higher. Or maybe the trend of EV's might be increasing relative to the total car sales. Now there is this really cool thing that Stephen Penman does in his book Accounting for Value. Let's assume that we have 500000 cars sold this year, what kind of growth would that require? A whopping 51% increase when overall car sales growth has been approximately 13.85% every year. So you cannot rely just on economic growth for this increase. EVs and ICE cars are substitute goods. When EVs decrease in price, then sales will increase but ICE cars sales will decrease. So China wants to make enough incentives for consumers to purchase EVs rather than ICEs. To have 500000 car sales in 2016, you need 41666 sales each month. But how does the EV growth look like? (I have not gone from the original numbers but this is what Bloomberg's graph of it looks like. I will. Just running out of time today.) http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-21/china-s-electric-car-subsidy-fraud-casts-doubt-on-surging-demand So yes, government subsidies have increased it EV sales dramatically but there are reports that many of these 'vehicle sales' are fraudulent. I'm not sure how to calculate the probability of them reaching 500000 cars this year but I'm going to put an increase of 14% as expected. If it was going to be at least  367410 cars, then I'll be pretty certain that can be managed easily. I would have my estimate at 99 -> 100%. However, the subsidies have to be enough to increase sales by (3.8-1) times of the national average. We don't have a supply and demand curve, but I'm going to put it at a tentative 1/(3.8-1), at a 36%. (When I've figured out how to use standard deviations again and if I have the data to produce one, I'll fix up my estimate again.)  There is a small chance that China or CAAM will attempt to fudge its numbers to prove to the world that it is going strong in environmental progress but I'm doubtful of this as China was not happy about this incident and wanted to cut its subsidies or change the way it worked but regardless, I'll add 5% to this. Many people here on the TGJP believe that China will fudge its numbers which is why they will definitely have 500000 cars sales published by the end of the year but I believe that Xi Jinping\u2019s administration will not look kindly to those who fudge the numbers which is why I'm not extremizing my forecast.

My thought process behind this went from the launch of the e5/e6 from BYD, both cheap (costing around 35K RMB), subsidized (up to 35% rebates) and the much much more likely to win a \"plate lottery\" (30% vs 0.017%), to a MCkinsey study (from 2013), shows that around 20% of chinas population should be able to afford an EV, as they're annual disposable income would be over 34K USD, but further research shown me that the problem lied on registering it, which costs around 14K USD, which has no credit/leasing arrangement. On top of that we have to take into account the Chinese preference when buying cars. None of the top 10 selling vehicles are Chinese, it is unanimous that they rather buy western cars, from whom a EV would cost anything around 30K-90K USD, plus registering fees over 14K USD. Simple math takes us to a proxy of 50K USD, to buy an EV from they're manufacturer of choice (on the cheap side). Smog and traffic prohibition is another factor. Since last year's red alert, regular cars have been banned from the roads from time to time, a penalty that EVs aren't in line for. Another thing to take into account is if the government will chose to falsify the numbers in order to reach its goal (\"really?\"), which I think it is not likely, since they have already shown good faith on the matter, after all this was the target for 2015. I think we are very likely to see a slowdown on growth, 300% is not likely to be repeated, since that would mean something close to a million EVs added to the traffic, over 5% of new cars had to be EVs for this to happen. I also see it a lot of long term incentives in place, and they are likely to push this market forward despite the economic challenges that china faces. People need to drive, and they want to drive. Which is why i'm placing a high probabilistic value on the \"faster licensing\", \"smog free pass\" and \"subsidies\" as those mature on top of feedback from EVs users working the word of mouth.

Past numbers of sales, by themselves, are supposed to be poor guides here, since we expect them to be growing substantially. We should look for some kind of base rate or model for the GROWTH, not for the NUMBERS. OPTIMISTIC STORY\nLet me frame it first in a way that makes it obvious that they will meet (and exceed) the 500k number. Here is the growth of EV sales in China, year on year [1,2,3]: 2012: 12.8k (inferred from below)\n2013: 17.6k, 1.38 times more than 2012\n2014: 74.8k, 4.25 times more than 2013\n2015: 331k, 4.43 times more than 2014\n(The links [1,2,3] give the above numbers of EVs but for some reason quote the growth factors for 2014 and 2015 as 3.2 and 3.4 respectively, I don't know why.) To reach 500k in 2016 we need growth by a factor of 1.51 over 2015. If we average the growth factors of the 3 previous years we get 3.35, more than twice the 1.51 limit. If we fit a quadratic function to the numbers above, we get a prediction of ~675k EVs in 2016. (The growth is clearly nonlinear, and quadratic is next simplest, plus fit is pretty good. An exponential fit gives nonsensically large predictions. I would very much like a story to motivate the quadratic model.) An interesting observation from the data in [1,2,3] is that sales are never more than 5% away from production; almost every EV made is sold. This would seem to indicate that the demand is there, and production is the bottleneck. News stories paint the Chinese government as eager on EV (going as far as building out and subsidizing charging networks [4]) and renewable energy more generally [5]. This suggests that they are serious about increasing production. On the political side, the Chinese minister of industry and information technology, Miao Wei, has recently been on record predicting 2016 sales to be twice those of 2015 [6]. (Like the quadratic model says!) Overall, on this optimistic story, it seems extremely likely that they will reach 500k in 2016. PESSIMISTIC STORY\nLet me frame it now in a way that makes it less likely they will reach 500k in 2016. I'll start by noting that the Chinese government is notoriously bad about publishing numbers. Combing through the archives [7], the sales numbers for April, May, November and December 2015 are simply missing. In any case, the pessimistic story is based primarily on Jan/Feb 2016 sales numbers [8]: 35.7k combined. Multiplying this by six we get a prediction of only 214.2k EVs in 2016. This might be too simplistic; surely there is a seasonality in car sales. Let's try to account for it. The total sales in 2015 (331k) were 26.6 times those of Jan/Feb 2015 combined. This would lead to a prediction of 950k in 2016, which seems too high; perhaps Jan/Feb 2015 were abnormally low for some reason. Let's use March instead. In 2015 total sales were 23.4 times March sales; if this persists in 2016, where March sales were 22.9k, we predict 537.7k EVs sold total, just over the edge. This means that any logistical hiccup would probably bring us below 500k. Other reasons to not meet the 500k: (1) The economywide slowdown in China [9], which might make sales fall significantly away from production for the first time;\n(2) Bad word of mouth about EVs. This year, an order of magnitude more people actually own EVs than in any previous year. If the EV experience is bad in any way, that is more likely to become known now. CONCLUSION\nI am way more convinced by the optimistic story. The quadratic model can account for the observations in the pessimistic story: in a parabola, ratios of later values to earlier values are increasing. The pessimistic story has trouble explaining the observations in the optimistic story: the economywide slowdown has been going on for more than a year. Given the Chinese government's plan to produce 5M EVs a year by 2020, I assign a high probability, say 90%, to the continued building out of EV factories and infrastructure. The models I can think of for this scenario predict a YES answer with near 100% certainty. On the other hand, if they stopped building new EV factories in March, there is still a decent chance --- more than 50%, say --- that they'd meet the 500k target. So I'm calling this one a 95% YES.

Focusing on US auto market, US EV market, auto stock technical analysis, and China stock market.  I was looking for inside view questions to ask and @Censusguyz asked about China EV restrictions.  This question go me to do some research and I found some information by Lux Research; \u201c1. The China market remains heavily policy-driven\u2026Buyers of plug-in vehicles in China enjoy a range of benefits, including generous financial incentives which subsidize the purchase price, as well as the ability to bypass license plate restrictions and waiting times...China will have to be careful to transition its plug-in vehicle industry gently, to avoid a sudden crash in unit sales\u201d\n\u201c2. Fraud happens in China, and the scale of misreporting remains opaque: The aforementioned generous subsidies have invited fraud in plug-in vehicles, where some companies try to abuse policy for monetary gain. For example, China\u2019s central government recently launched a fraud investigation around plug-in vehicle sales, where vehicles are not really built in working conditions, or assembled to very poor standards, and parked in \u201cghost fleets\u201d that never get used. The government said that it will begin to carry out surprise inspections as a way to combat this fraud. Until they are able to control this situation, the claimed unit sales in China must be taken with a grain of salt\u201d\n\u201c3. China\u2019s vehicles are typically domestic-only offerings, and cannot compete on the world stage, for now: Most OEMs\u2019 plug-in offerings are \u201cglobal\u201d \u2013 for example, the Tesla Model S is sold not just in the OEM\u2019s US home market, but also in Europe, China, and beyond... However, China\u2019s market stands apart in this respect. As the figure below shows, the best-selling plug-ins in China are domestic-only offerings, which are not sold anywhere else in the world. This trend makes it less likely that the high sales of plug-ins in China will spill over to other markets soon. However, some China-based OEMs are looking to change this trend: For example, BYD has already started selling a few of its plug-ins in Europe and the US, and will be looking to ramp up its international sales over the coming years. This leap will be difficult \u2013 requiring significant investment in boosting initial quality, long-term reliability, and overall performance \u2013 but some China-based OEMs will be able to make this expansion eventually.\u201d\n\u201c4. The battery pack size is much smaller in China than in other markets like the US: In our analysis, we have found that in Q4 2015 the average pack size in plug-ins sold on the US market was 53 kWh per vehicle, helped by the popularity of the Tesla Model S and new Model X. However, in China, plug-ins use much fewer batteries \u2013 on average, just 19 kWh per average plug-in sold. There is also the issue of which types of batteries are preferred: China\u2019s developers continue to use large amounts of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes, whereas in the US and Europe OEMs are moving towards newer nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathode chemistries. Therefore, although the China market looks alluring from a raw vehicle unit sales count, the preference for smaller battery packs and older cathode chemistries means that developers should judge their investment levels carefully.\u201d I have faith that China will continue to lack integrity for production numbers, Chinese EV manufacturers to continue to pump out units as fast as possible before the Chinese Government takes the punch away, and considering the smaller batteries that means you can build more cars.  I wonder if some industrial engineer came up with this idea to build more units?  That means more subsidies from the government.  The outside picture looks gloomy and the inside picture looks desperate.

Once erected, solar / wind projects are essentially fuel free, they are modular so pay-back can be relatively quick, and they benefit from technology learning / cost curves, unlike extractive fuel projects, except in certain countries, or fracking in US which benefits from the same technology improvements over time via repetition. China has leadership in this \"new\" energy, and EVs will sit square within that.

The rapid growth in electric vehicles looks set to continue and the government is likely to encourage this as part of its efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. For me, though, the clincher is the confident statement at ministerial level - in China heads are likely to roll if targets aren't met. \"Electric vehicle sales and production will double in China in 2016, according to recent reports. This refers of course to both all-electric vehicles (EVs) and also to plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). This matches a similar claim made by BYD founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu in an interview with Sustainnovate right after BYD won the 2016 Zayed Future Energy Prize in theLarge Corporation category.
