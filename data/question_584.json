I am going to guess that what's different in September is at least in part how Russian citizens now view Trump.  As Putin has gone public with how Trump isn't going to help with the sanctions at this point, citizens now regard him much more unfavorably (see article below).  I agree with @Mathletes regarding the narrow range. That said, does the Government Approval increase or decrease from where it's at now? ( 50% approval vs. 49 disapproval in August) The next 20 days in September are what we're talking about.  I'm guessing an increase over 50% because it's relative to how Russian citizens view Trump vs/ Putin. https://qz.com/1046611/trumps-approval-rating-in-russia-falls-to-just-18-after-the-sanctions-bill/ .....\"Now, with his hands tied by Congress over sanctions, Trump is losing out even in Russia.
