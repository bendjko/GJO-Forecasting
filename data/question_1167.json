Early Warning Project\u2019s own risk assessment rates the risk in Yemen for mass killings as high, currently 6th in the world because Yemen is currently experiencing mass killings. It is unlikely that these mass killings will halt in upcoming months. Human Rights Watch issued a report in November of 2018 regarding the deteriorating situation in Yemen in which 6,782 civilians had been killed and 10,768 wounded largely as a result of coalition air strikes that indiscriminately target civilians and combatants alike. In addition, the illegitimate Houthi government has \u201cdisappeared\u201d many civilian journalists, lawyers, and activists. Perhaps the largest threat is the blocking of humanitarian aid by numerous armed groups which has placed 14 million people at risk of starvation and a cholera epidemic. International Crisis Group has alerted that the situation in Yemen as of May 2019 has deteriorated and is at a higher risk of continued violent conflict. Military escalation between Iran and Saudi Arabia increases the risk for further Saudi-led coalition air strikes against Iran backed Houthi forces on the ground in Yemen. In a 7 June 2019 report on the Complex Emergency in Yemen released by USAID states that as recently as 24 May an air strike conducted hit a fuel station killing 12 civilians. USAID also recorded approximately 364,000 cases of Cholera across Yemen, which if medical humanitarian aid continues to be restricted by armed groups may result in many more deaths than the 640 deaths reported. UNDP released a report 30 April 2019 claiming that if a ceasefire is not implemented by the end of the year the conflict could result in a death toll of 233,000 people approximately 102,000 of which would be conflict related deaths and 131,000 would be from starvation and lack of proper health services resulting from the current difficulties in providing access to humanitarian aid. Mines and IEDs are also increasingly impacting civilians, ACLED reported in January 2019 that there has been at least 267 civilian fatalities related to IEDs and mines planted by Houthis. These mines and IEDs present a larger concern for civilians living outside of metropolitan areas.

Similarly, the Italian Institute for International Political Studies also claimed it to be a conflict to watch in 2019.\" [2] Inside view:\n- From EWP: \"The civilian population of Yemen has suffered tremendously during the country\u2019s ongoing war, including from indiscriminate aerial bombardment and from a war-triggered humanitarian crisis. Yemen has been ranked sixth or higher in each of our past three annual assessments. Significant risk factors that contributed to the current assessment include a lack of freedom of movement for men, the country\u2019s anocratic regime type, its geographic region, the presence of political killings, and ongoing armed conflict. It should be noted, as we explained in a November 2015 blog post, that our project\u2019s definition of mass killing excludes situations in which one country\u2019s armed forces attack civilians in another country\u2019s territory. Thus, killings perpetrated by foreign militaries are reflected neither in this forecast nor in its underlying data.\" According to this definition, Saudi Arabia's campaign does not count. The Houthi seem to target mainly Saudi forces, not civilians from what I can tell. [2]\n- ISIL was active in Yemen in the past, but doesn't seem to be anymore. [3]\n- Al-Qaeda has been active in Yemen. [4] However, they seem to be involved in the fighting as opposed to deliberately targeting civilians. Overall judgment:\n- to me the situation seems worse than it is in terms of mass killing campaigns under the definition of this question. Both EWP and crowd seem to be off here.\n- I find it hard to give a concrete scenario that involves 1,000 deliberately killed civilians. These would have to be quite novel developments.\n- therefore, my informed gut judgment is 5%.

Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. According to the UN and other sources, only from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670\u201313,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians, as well as estimates of more than 50,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. The stalemate has produced an unrelenting humanitarian crisis, with at least 8.4 million people at risk of starvation and 22.2 million people - 75% of the population - in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of five. The UN (2019) considers Yemen to be the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people at risk of starvation and recurrent outbursts of deadly diseases.  However, regardless of the above-mentioned terrific numbers and trends, it is important to look carefully to what the question is asking. The key-word here  is \u201csystematically\u201d,  which is then defined as \u201ccampaigns that systematically kill civilians include, but are not limited to, policies which intentionally kill civilians en masse (e.g., military strategies that intentionally target civilians, mass execution of a specific group) and policies that knowingly result in widespread death (e.g., mass starvation, confiscation of health care supplies, forced relocation)\u201d. Therefore, regardless of the massive death toll in Yemen, it seems that both sides (Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi armed movement) lack the ability to effectively carry out an intentional mass killing as such.  That said, it would be na\u00efve to treat Yemen was just as an internal conflict. The conflict has widely been seen as an extension of the Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict and as a means to combat Iranian influence in the region. Not by chance, the conflict escalated dramatically in March 2015, when Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states - backed by the US, UK, and France - began air strikes against the Houthis, with the declared aim of restoring Mr Hadi's government. In this regard, according to the UN, more than 60% of civilian deaths have been the result of Saudi-led air strikes. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote that the Saudi-led air campaign that began on 26 March 2015, had \"conducted airstrikes in apparent violation of the laws of war, such as the March 30 attack on a displaced persons camp in Mazraq, northern Yemen, that struck a medical facility and a market\". Nevertheless, since the beginning of the hostilities, no systematic death campaign has led to 1,000 or more civilians in Yemen. To tell the truth, if we look at the pattern in the long run, Yemen has never had a mass killing according to EWP. Terrorist groups, although well established on the territory, do not have the means to carry out such a massive campaign. At least not one party alone (as the question specifies: \u201cthe question will only resolve as yes if 1,000 civilian fatalities occur in one or more campaigns\u201d).  The possibility of drone\u2019s attacks by the international community\u2019s airstrike, mainly by the USA, is also very unlikely. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented 415 strikes in Pakistan and Yemen by 2015, and according to the organization's estimates, between 423 and 962 deaths are believed to have been civilians. Even though the number of civilians of this trend is high, we must consider that is the total number of American\u2019s strikes of two countries together (where Pakistan is the most affected) and that the research started counting the number of deaths from 2001, by far before the beginning of Yemen\u2019s war. That said, neither if those drone strikes occurred all together between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2020 and only in Yemen it would be enough to have considered it a massive killing of 1000 individuals or more.  The only actor which might lead to such an outcome is the Saudi-led coalition which, as said before, through its airstrikes has caused 60% of civilian deaths so far. Nevertheless, the successful negotiations in Stockholm and the following ceasefire agreed between the 2 sides, although close to collapse more than once, has significantly lowered the number of airstrikes. Whether it will be renewed and respected until 31 March 2020 or not is hard to say. However, even if not, the systematic killing of 1000 people before that date remains unlikely. Concluding, I believe that the only chance of the outcome \u201cYes\u201d of this question occurring is represented by famine resulting from a systematic restriction/boycott of humanitarian aids and essential goods. Indeed, famine is reported as the first reason for death in Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition\u2019s in the recent past has already delayed and diverted many aids, closed critical ports, and stopped goods from entering Houthi-controlled seaports. Considering the already critical condition of Yemen\u2019s population, an increase of this practice would definitely make possible the death of 1000 or more people due to starvation. However, since the great number of factors contributing to starvation in Yemen, it would be difficult for statistical think tanks to point the finger to just one precise responsible/coalition in case of mass starvation. For this reason, I limit the likelihood that an armed group from Yemen engage in a campaign that systematically kills 1,000 or more to a 10% chance.

In Yemen, currently, neither side has complete control on the situation and the influence of out-of-state actors act as somewhat of a guard against one side gaining the definite upper hand. Further, while both sides are still vying for support from yet more out of state actors such as the U.S, neither side has a motivation to carry out as widely unpopular a campaign such as planned killings. https://kh.boell.org/en/2016/10/06/why-genocide-occurs\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/11/15/experts-discuss-the-war-in-yemen-and-the-role-of-international-actors/"], [61269, "2019-03-30T17:22:53Z", [0.1], ""], [28166, "2019-03-30T03:13:55Z", [0.03], ""], [26551, "2019-03-29T21:04:28Z", [0.25], "Using my previous forecast to Jan 1st."], [1333, "2019-03-29T18:09:02Z", [0.45], ""]], "open_date": "2019-03-29T17:00:57Z", "close_date": "2019-07-01T06:59:57Z"}
