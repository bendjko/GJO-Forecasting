There are reports that people in other countries, who have not been to China, have been infected during visits to Thailand. They could have just been very unlucky or it could be that there are a lot more infected people in Thailand (than officially counted) to pass the virus on.  It could be that Thailand is at the stage that China was around the 12th Jan just before the number of case took off.  The time between supposed dates of becoming infected, dates when the infection has been diagnosed, and indeed deaths does show the problem in controlling the outbreak.  The deaths seem to occur a week or more after the diagnosis, which is up to 2 weeks after the infection.

Check out https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-toll/ and https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (note that the scale is logarithmic, so that apparently linear trend would look exponential on a linear scale). @jayb is right in his logic a few comments below. At the same time, if there's a massive difference in between the actual people having nCOV2019 and the reported number of case, there's also going to be a massive difference in between who do we know died of it, thus who WHO knows died of it and that only by 15th of Feb... The trend is clear. It's not SARS, not MERS and it's spreading a LOT faster then those did. It already reached a pandemic level. Mortality is low but even 1% from 1.000.000 = 10.000, without the possibility of vaccinating from it so... it's not exactly good news. Even in the very-less-likely scenario that the death toll would, for some reason, stay at a steady rate of ~40 deaths confirmed per day, it would still go over 774 by 15th of Feb. Right now, death rate is growing constantly for over 1 week and it shows no sign to stop, nor it has any reason to since the number of confirmed cases is also growing constantly. There is a chance WHO won't get a lot more reports by 15th of Feb, there's also a chance trying new cocktails of meds might have some positive results. Still, most importantly, there simply can't be more people in the hospital at the same time diagnosed by medics so... we can't say who has it, who doesn't and who dies by it in China alone. That being said, a reasonable amount of 30% has to be attributed to post 15th of Feb as things look right now. *Subject to reconsider based on future data*"], [67609, "2020-02-03T10:06:21Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], "New update, averaging the exponential, linear and saturation models (with the saturation one given half the weight of the others).

The data have been updated everyday.  Since mid-January, the number of confirmed cases has been rising exponentially.  In the last 7 days (since 26 January), its rise is almost a straight line.  A linear regression of the 7-day data shows a slope of 1898 cases per day.  Closer examination of the data indicates that the rate of increase is getting faster, e.g. 2099 in 31 January and 2579 in 1 February.   This rapid rise in infected cases is reminiscent of the SARS.  At the height of the SARS outbreak, the number of infected cases increased rapidly for 2 weeks before tapering off [2].  However in the Wuhan case, the rapid rise has just started.  It is reasonable to expect this rapid rise will continue for at least another two weeks (remember that the rise rate is actually increasing). During this 7-day rising period, the fatality rate for the Wuhan outbreak is slightly higher than 2% (2.3% to be more exactly).   If we assume the linear regression slope (a conservative estimate since the infection rate appears to be increasing) and a 2.3% fatality rate, the number of infected cases will be 38483 by 14 February and total death will be 885 which is higher than the total SARS deaths of 774.

The first thing is that there is signs of a transition from exponential to linear. It is not clear whether this is because the quarantine is actually working, or because of a series of other external factors distorting the real numbers (lack of test kits, intentional underreporting, necessity to demonstrate the narrative that the quarantine is working). Be it as it may, it will be really unlikely that the numbers of the WHO would contradict the Chinese numbers for the time being, even if they suspect that they might be doctored or might contain methodological errors. Right now I will consider three scenarios: 1) Linear growth from today till February 14th in China (which will correspond to the WHO data of February 15th): this gives something of the order of 900 death with a standard deviation of 100 2) Saturation: I fit the cases and numbers of deaths to a model of the type  Cases(n) = HC * (1 + Tanh((n - n0)/lambda) Here HC is half-the-total projected cases, n is the number of days (n=18 is Feb 2, n=19 Feb 3, etc), n0 the offset, and lambda a time scale. For deaths I get HC = 293, n0 = 17.3, lambda = 6.3, while for cases it is a similar number but with HC = 10791. The statistical error in HC seems to be small, which means saturation at about 600 deaths and an almost zero probability of reaching SARS before February 15th. 3) Exponential growth, in which case we reach the number of cases before Feb 15. Model 1) gives about 80-90% probability of reaching the number before Feb 15, 2) gives a 0% because this will never reach the number of cases of SARS, at last if there is not a second outbreak and 3) gives about 100%. By averaging the three I get 60-63% for the first bucket. Now this have to be revised in about four hours when the new data from China are updated. Saturation predicts that we will move from 304 to 350 cases. If tonight we have 350 cases I will begin to believe the saturation hypothesis. Otherwise, I will re-update. Update: 360 deaths, a bit above what expected in the saturation model. Refitting gives HC = 323, and saturation about 646 deaths. Probably there is something right in the saturation model for the current situation, but it underfits the trend.

The rate of exponential growth may be starting to slow, but still exponential.  There are two hypotheses that could explain the appearance of exponential growth in official figures through 1/29: \n1) The disease is still in it's exponential growth phase.  2) Alternatively, as pointed out by @JC4841 and @Greyowlsova (and implied by others in their estimates) the appearance of exponential growth in official figures may instead be reflective of things like increasing awareness/education of clinicians, the rate at which the government response is ramping up, the capacity of laboratory diagnostics ramping up, etc. These other growth rates may themselves be exponential in nature for a while and have nothing to do with the underlying growth of the disease.  I believe that both are true to an extent, but that the numbers mostly reflect the progress of the disease. In other words I think hypothesis 1 is \"more true\" than #2 and is the right one to use for modeling.  If the first is true then the questions is: when and by how much will the exponential growth slow and eventually peak? If the second is true then the question is: what's the true underlying rate of growth of the disease?  How can we test to determine which hypothesis is more likely? (That's not a rhetorical question; I really don't know.)  Observations: \n1) The official confirmed figures are minimum numbers so are clearly \"wrong\" in the sense that they are incomplete/too low, perhaps by a lot, because they only include cases confirmed with a laboratory test. Presumably some (many?) people have the virus and have not been tested.  2) Office figures appear to be internally inconsistent because the implied relationship between R0, case growth rate and incubation time doesn't make sense in terms of standard epidemiological models. See: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2231864-new-coronavirus-looks-set-to-cause-a-pandemic-how-do-we-control-it/ From what I gather, the most likely explains are some combination of:\n    -- there are many more cases that currently reported and these are mostly milder cases\n    -- incubation time is shorter that currently thought\n    -- R0 is lower than implied by the data\n\n3) It's almost certainly true that the ramp-up in government testing capabilities and outreach efforts is partly responsible for the increase in reported cases. 4) In general governments have an incentive to downplay the severity of epidemics. I'm not implying that anyone in the US or China is doing that, but maybe in other countries that could be an issue. For example I can imagine countries like Thailand not wanting to scare away tourists in peak season. My current estimate is that we'll hit >800 cases around Feb 12-14.
