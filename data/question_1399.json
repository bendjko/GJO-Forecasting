I took two approaches here: first by segment, and second by total. I understand that they share the same source so they are not independent, but I still like that they aligned.  1) By segment - three segments of total US solar capacity: utility, residential, and non-residential. Utility: 1.6 GW installed in Q1 [2] + 1.0 GW in Q2 = 2.6 GW so far in 2019. 8.1 GW forecast for the year, so 5.5 GW for the rest of the year. 3 GW installed in Q4 2018 (SEIA forecast 3.5 GW) [3]. 678 MW installed in Q3 2018 [4], so Q4 was 82% of utility installations in the second half of 2018. Applying this to the forecast for second half of 2019, Q4 should expect 4.5 GW of utility installations.  Residential: appears to be mature and stable. \"Q2 2019 was the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 600 MWdc of installed residential capacity.\" [1] 628 MW installed in Q2 2019. Assuming 5% QoQ growth, forecast of 692 MW. Non-residential: 426 MW installed in Q2 2019, down 2% QoQ, and down 16% YoY, due to \"state level policy reforms and interconnection delays... Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.\" [1] Assuming -5% QoQ growth, forecast of 384 MW. Sum by segment: 4.5 (utility) + 0.692 (residential) + 0.384 (non-residential) = 5.6 GW 2) Total: based on Figure 2.4, about 13 MW forecast for 2019. 2.7 GW installed in Q1 [2] + 2.1 GW in Q2 = 4.7 GW so far, leaving 8.3 GW for the rest of the year. 4.2 GW total installed in Q4 2018, a 139% increase from Q3 2018 [3], indicating Q4 is typically a strong quarter for installations. 1.7 GW installed in Q3 2018 [4], so Q4 was 71% of the second half of 2018 installations.  Assuming Q4 2019 is 71% of second half installations, forecast for Q4 = 5.9 GW.  Even if SEIA projections were 40% off from the lower 5.6 GW I got, that would still put it at 3.36 GW, safely in the last bucket.  Future update: SEIA report in Q3 (for Q2 data) was released September 17th. Assuming Q4 report (for Q3 data) will be released in December.

Using the major solar projects list (https://www.seia.org/research-resources/major-solar-projects-list) I have compiled a list (FAR from incomplete) of large scale projects which are due to complete in Q4 2019. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UsS2RXNhNci4mpJeYu0FfkoNFvlgGM7OsmPmjvxcYhM/edit?usp=sharing This currently totals 1.18GW (as of 19/11/19) with 11 projects, but I will keep adding to the list and expect to see the total rise. This also does not include home/residential installations, which are about 600MW on average from the past three years Q4. There are also non residential installations to account for, but I cannot find good projections for these by quarter. The stocks for the major solar energy companies in the US are either stable or rising, suggesting that projects are likely to be completed and that there is an expectation that the companies will do well in the future, potentially off of capacity installed this year.  Note - the major solar projects list is not 100% up to date, particularly in california as many projects listed as in construction are actually completed. To conclude, we have residential, non residential and utilities. The year projection from SEIA is about 13GW, in Q1 we had 2.7GW, Q2, 2.1, which equals 4.8GW, leaving 8GW remaining of expected installation.
