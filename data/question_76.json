Yes, there was an earthquake in the right place for a test.  Does North Korea often experience natural earthquakes of this magnitude in that area? A search of USGS archives shows that yesterday's earthquake coincided in three dimensions with a verified test on 2009-05-25 00:54:43 and that those two were only a few miles away from two other verified tests. However -- I notice that there is no source identified for how to resolve this question. While I find it far fetched that a 5.1 earthquake could occur with the same epicenter as a prior confirmed nuclear explosion, it is not impossible. Comparison class: each previous test occurred a few miles from any prior test(s). Yesterday's test was co-located with a previous one. Would it make sense to dig out the same tunnel where a previous test occurred, despite fractured rocks and radioactivity? Alternatively, given that the region is tectonically active, could the prior test have destabilized a dormant fault, leading to North Korea taking advantage of this event by -- gasp -- lying? Not likely, but the experts will be looking for other evidence to confirm that this was a nuclear test, for example https://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2013/ctbto-detects-radioactivity-consistent-with-12-february-announced-north-korean-nuclear-test/"], [832, "2016-01-06T18:50:57Z", [0.95], ""], [12874, "2016-01-06T18:36:54Z", [0.92], "What is the resolution criteria, in terms of doubts about North Koreas claims etc. ?"], [1529, "2016-01-06T18:35:08Z", [0.99], ""], [368, "2016-01-06T18:25:17Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2016-01-06T17:35:03Z", [0.99], ""], [2380, "2016-01-06T17:32:06Z", [1.0], ""], [14166, "2016-01-06T17:12:55Z", [0.99], ""], [12879, "2016-01-06T17:05:34Z", [0.99], ""], [102, "2016-01-06T16:58:51Z", [1.0], "http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/nordkorea-meldet-test-einer-wasserstoffbombe-a-1070660.html Max R Dechantsreiter:  The difficulty of getting a two-stage nuclear weapon to work being so great (ask the French!), I speculate this test may simply have been a \"boosted\" primary, which would require only a few grams of tritium.

The CBR Defense Command said should North Korea carry out its fourth nuclear test, it will take a new format. \"The North could detonate its boosted fission weapon, but we don't believe it is yet capable of directly testing hydrogen bombs,\" it added.  In December, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stated that his country had developed hydrogen bombs, though the claim was met with skepticism by experts.  The CBR Defense Command added the North may also be building a light water reactor to produce tritium. \"Technologically advanced nations have tested and developed boosted fission weapons about 10 years after their initial nuclear tests,\" the command said. \"North Korea, 15 years after developing its nuclear capability, may be going ahead with heavy hydrogen production and warhead design. The North, however, doesn't appear to be in the final stages of completing its hydrogen bombs.\"\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-preparing-thermonuclear-weapon-tests-report-2247006 Countries, working to produce nuclear weapons, usually first develop weapons that use nuclear fission to break larger atoms, such as Uranium and Plutonium, into smaller atoms. Thermonuclear weapons or fusion weapons. . .  are more complicated to make. It takes countries many years to independently develop the technology needed to create a fission bomb and then make the subsequent jump to fusion weapons.  However, as part of making fusion weapons, some countries develop \u201cboosted\u201d fission bombs which use a small amount of fusion to boost the fission process, releasing more energy.\n. . . \n\"Last week, the U.S. research institute 38 North reportedly said that based on its new high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, North Korea is pressing ahead with the excavation of the new tunnel at Punggye-ri.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  In my opinion, it's not a question of \"if\", it's a question of \"when\", and will it be before this question closes.  The \"when\" may be predictable by the status of the work being done at the test site.   38 North continues to say that no test appears imminent.

In July 2015, Ji Jae Ryong, North Korea\u2019s ambassador to China, said the Iran deal is irrelevant because the North is already \u201ca nuclear weapons state both in name and in reality.\u201d \u201cWe are not interested at all in dialogue to discuss the issue of freezing or dismantling our nukes unilaterally first,\u201d he said at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing. Since then, satellite image showed active activity at Punggye-ri nuclear test site. North Korea also reportedly digging a new tunnel at Punggye-ri to prepare for more tests.

A six-month burn period for the core is about normal for North Korea.   Its technicians have pulled the core for reprocessing after short burn periods in the past. On the other hand, North Korea also has halted operations at Yongbyon after a short burn period because of the threat of a systems failure.\n\nPulling the core is not necessarily a preparation for a nuclear test, as some South Korean news services speculated. In the1990s pulling the core always meant preparations for producing more plutonium, the only nuclear weapons path the North Koreans had at that time. Based on their extensive experience with plutonium, they probably intend to make more plutonium-based weapons.\n\nStill, a new warhead design would need testing. A South Korean news service quoted a government official who said that the North Koreans are digging another tunnel at the site used for North Korea\u2019s three past tests. Personnel and vehicles are active at the site, indicating a test is not imminent.\n\nUntil North Korea activated the graphite-moderated reactor last April, it appeared that the North had switched to highly enriched uranium for use in its nuclear weapons. It is now clear that both paths for producing weapons-grade fissile material are available. That suggests the North is not bluffing when its propaganda talks about increasing its nuclear threat.\n\n "], [6187, "2015-11-15T21:58:36Z", [0.8], "Weakness of us foreign policy under.current administration "], [7237, "2015-11-15T21:50:58Z", [0.67], "After sending a senior advisor to \"re-education\" recently (from perceived disloyalty) he will be a little more insecure and attempt to show China his continued strength and control of the country, military, and his own future.\nIf he has nuclear material available, and sufficient financial resource (Chinese have been squeezing him), Kim will wish to make a display of power."], [6030, "2015-11-15T21:46:14Z", [0.65], ""], [10303, "2015-11-15T21:28:36Z", [0.28], ""], [6761, "2015-11-15T21:21:40Z", [0.45], ""], [8267, "2015-11-15T21:19:01Z", [0.25], ""], [10762, "2015-11-15T21:15:43Z", [0.35], ""], [6903, "2015-11-15T21:12:02Z", [0.75], "The boy needs attention..."], [1337, "2015-11-15T21:12:00Z", [0.15], ""], [5160, "2015-11-15T20:53:58Z", [0.75], ""], [1118, "2015-11-15T20:48:59Z", [0.67], "Wacky guy will do anything to get international media attention.
