As the previous front runner before Arpaio entered (when McSally moved up) and one of three candidates in a very tight race so far, if she thought playing toward Trump and the classic Trump campaign method were a safe thing, she would include them and then remind audiences of other connections and history as well.

I imagine the harder he would push for support & funding in established party areas with long-term senate seat goals, the more likely he is to get mixed signals and lukewarm support.  The more he comes out swinging verbally in public and uses reputation and public sentiment to gather strength, I think the more he stands a good chance of having it work against him over the long term, giving other GOP candidates content for criticisms against him and stiffening moderate and democratic antipathy for him in the final election should he win the primary.   I'm not sure there's much of a safe path for campaigning aggressively that will suit Arpaio's style and not also work against him.

This hurts his odds of running an effective primary campaign and/or receiving a much-needed endorsement from Mr. Trump. Even with an endorsement from Trump, Arpaio will struggle to win a majority of primary voters considering the dynamic between Arpaio and the two opposing candidates Kelli Ward and Martha McSally. Ward has actively voiced the anti-establishment, MAGA \"red meat\" rhetoric that appeals to Trump Republicans and she will surely double down on this approach during the primary while finding ways to show she is the better MAGA candidate than Arpaio. Comparing their personalities and Ward's broad legislative experience to Arpaio's narrow focus as Sheriff suggests Ward will effectively address more issues that impact everyday life while Arpaio will be less comfortable outside of issues relating to immigration and law enforcement. While Arpaio's unsympathetic and legally-challenged history as Sheriff may be a selling point for some, it will be easy fodder for negative ads. This will give Ward better chances to win over women who support Trump and voters who hold net neutral-to-positive views of immigrants. This dynamic will fracture the pro-Trump Republican base and deny Arpaio the unified base he needs to secure the nomination. While Ward lacks Arpaio's national notoriety and has not raised significant funds, she ran a competitive primary campaign against McCain in 2016 is likely to win enough would-be Arpaio voters to deny him the nomination. While Ward and Arpaio battle for the support of the hard-right and Trump voters, the other Republican candidate, Martha McSally, will have a greater degree of freedom to address broad-base issues without necessarily rebuking the Trump base. McSally has reported the most campaign funds of the three candidates, is leading in the polls (as of today) and is expected to receive full support from the RNC and Mitch McConnell. Given Trump's failed endorsements in Alabama and his constant shift away from Banon's anti-establishment rhetoric toward unity with McConnell and Paul Ryan, it's reasonable to assume Trump will be pressured to follow the party line and endorse mainstream candidates like McSally. Facing historically dim prospects for the 2018 midterms, Republicans will go all-out to keep seats in Congress and McSally is their best bet to win the general election. If Trump were to endorse Arpaio, it would hurt Republican chances and more Republican losses represent an existential threat to Trump's presidency. Trump's decision making has historically followed his own self-interests over any given person, party, or policy position. Trump will likely face impeachment with a Democratic majority in congress, so he will do what he must to prevent this from happening. Therefore, it is more likely that he will endorse McSally over Arpaio because McSally is widely seen as the best chance for Republicans to win that Senate seat.

If her count didn't improve the second time, even though she won the runoff with 70% of votes, then I have doubts she has upward momentum this time round. Although she is getting good press and I think she would appeal to democratic state counties, she might not appeal to enforcement/military side of things or to very conservative republicans as she's litigious against military in her quest for equality.  As it's a battleground state, I think Trump had a meeting and asked for a plan B and Apacio was it based on his being elected 12 times in a row for a 24-year run.

Primary Election\tAugust 28, 2018\tinside view of Apacio as candidate\n-trump loyalist and closely aligned in platform i.e migrant agenda,\n- loyalty of and to law enforcement especially ICE\n- Trump pardon = vested interest in this horse\n- one of largest forfeiture corridor in a state with one of the smallest populations --> 100% goes to law enforcement. Full policing powers, taxation powers, and mayor of one of largest counties. -Palatability \nCanny politician. - popular with voters for flouting law (some politicians are not popular for doing same thing!) He explains unpalatable things well. i.e. \"didn't like the way some in the senate were speaking of the President.\u201d Regarding tent cities: \u201cMilitary in Iraq, in full uniform live in tents\" [in even hotter conditions] so don't complain, etc \u201c [I\u2019m not saying I approve of this.] \n I'm making the point that his voter base would approve of this. They feel that Trump is being undermined by democrats and even some 'traitor' republicans as well as DOJ, media, foreign governments, etc. I think they would also like that he sticks it to DOJ, judges, new outlets. - AZ demographics and past referendum results seem to support his ultra-conservative platform - He's loyal to enforcement and they are loyal to him --> this aligns well with Trump's stated objectives with migrants and ICE support OTOH\n- so polarizing that partisan opposition might band together and steal away his votes - 5%\n- many lawsuits (100+million plus fees) that come out of county treasury i.e tax payers - 10%\n- some heinous human and civil rights abuses that he might not be able to justify\n- Hispanic votes seem to have moved him out of office and Paul Penzone in 2016 (I wonder if this was in anticipation of a Hilary landslide that year, but that kite didn't fly) But , maybe,  if poll numbers are still close they might affect outcome at state level. There is a shocking lack of strategy noises regarding this from Democrats.
