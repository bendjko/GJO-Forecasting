The king announced his decision after spending two days meeting with party leaders, including those in charge of the conservative Popular Party, the center-left Socialists, the far-left Podemos party and the business-friendly Ciudadanos party. His decision means that no party will be able to assemble a minority or coalition government that would assume control of the 350-member lower house of Parliament by May 2 and sets up a new election for June 26.

The meetings, the third round of talks the king has held with political leaders, were the last chance to come to some kind of agreement before a May 2 deadline. But the conversations only resulted in further recriminations among the party leaders, who blamed each other for making Spain ungovernable.

On top of this, the proliferation of corruption scandals around the party, and four years without proper dialogue between the PP and the opposition, have made it impossible for Rajoy to strike a deal with any other party to get elected as Prime Minister again. Knowing that his chances of getting voted by the Parliament were null, he went as far as rejecting the call from the King to try to form a government. It seemed safer, at least at that time, to see his Socialist opponent fail in the attempt instead of him. \"The new centrist-liberal party, Ciudadanos, as well as a number of relevant Socialists, have made it clear that no agreement is possible with the conservatives if Rajoy does not step down, but the proposal has been rebuffed by Rajoy and it seems not to have made inroads among the PP high brass. The PP likes to present itself as a strong, unified party in which leaderships are uncontested and internal conflict inexistent. So the People\u2019s Party has to make a choice it has never before faced: it can lose a relatively damaged Rajoy and use its plurality to lead a coalition government, or it can keep Rajoy and its aura of being a monolithic, strong party. \"The Socialist Party (PSOE) also faces a difficult choice between two options that had never been incompatible before. The Socialists have been in government for 21 years since 1982,  . . . . At the same time, since 1996 (the year in which the conservatives first won the general election), it has consistently built its identity as the alternative to the People\u2019s Party \u2013 a strategy that has enabled the Socialists to mobilise their own electoral base and encourage tactical voting among leftists in general. \"Both principles used to be easy to blend, but not anymore. A deal with Podemos, the new anti-austerity party, would allow Pedro S\u00e1nchez to succeed Rajoy as Prime Minister, but it would alienate those that appreciate the Socialists as a reliably centrist party. Any coalition with the PP, on the other hand, would have the opposite effect. Moreover, because this dilemma has been enacted by internal fractions, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s room for manoeuvre has been substantially reduced. \"Felipe VI, the new king enthroned in June 2014, is also sailing in uncharted waters. In Spain, as in other parliamentary monarchies, the King reigns but he does not rule. . . . With four major parties, none of them even close to absolute majority, and no two-party coalition short of a grand coalition big enough to reach that same threshold, the arbiter can tip the balance one way or another. \"Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off between the King keeping his role as a neutral institutional anchor that does not interfere with political decisions, which appears to be the patch he has chosen to take, and his capacity to take brisker action and hasten the process in a more proactive way. The decision to make it public that Rajoy had turned down the King\u2019s offer to form a new government, followed by the decision to make that same offer to Pedro S\u00e1nchez, followed by the decision, after the latter\u2019s failure, not to make any other offer before conditions have changed, has probably minimised the pressure upon parties to strike a deal, and at the same time has preserved his supra-partes status. At the same time, however, the fact that it is taking months to elect a prime minister might be taking a toll on Spain\u2019s institutions. Again, an uncomfortable, unprecedented decision for a key actor. ~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: Hopes were raised last week when PSOE & Podemos leaders agreed to meet before Easter, but then it turned out to be \"impossible\" for them to meet, so a phone call was arranged--on a day when neither man had any official commitments on their calendars.\n"], [102, "2016-03-25T01:08:28Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.08, 0.88], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/gitrep-24mar16pm/"], [691, "2016-03-24T19:32:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14613, "2016-03-24T18:43:24Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], ""], [12268, "2016-03-24T16:51:57Z", [0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.93], ""], [361, "2016-03-24T15:49:53Z", [0.01, 0.03, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [452, "2016-03-23T19:31:01Z", [0.06, 0.05, 0.01, 0.88], ""], [691, "2016-03-23T18:38:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [19194, "2016-03-23T17:29:14Z", [0.41, 0.07, 0.22, 0.3], ""], [19198, "2016-03-23T17:25:31Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [17007, "2016-03-23T17:24:11Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [19192, "2016-03-23T17:19:58Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [19193, "2016-03-23T17:15:42Z", [0.07, 0.08, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [19195, "2016-03-23T17:14:02Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [19197, "2016-03-23T17:12:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [689, "2016-03-23T13:55:50Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [15964, "2016-03-23T08:45:56Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.96], ""], [15186, "2016-03-23T04:42:25Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], ""], [18343, "2016-03-22T22:48:37Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [22747, "2016-03-22T22:23:08Z", [0.35, 0.35, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [14182, "2016-03-22T20:42:00Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], "https://www.thespainreport.com/articles/689-160321183709-pp-denies-it-has-offered-deputy-pm-post-to-ciudadanos-rivera No offer according to PP to Ciudadanos.

This may change things in favour of Podemos in the scenario of \"new ways to talks\" for understanding both outside and inside the organization. Podemos was bleeding support in both ways, externally and internally, but Pablo Iglesias (Podemos presidential candidate and also general secretariat)  made a surprising movement (for the good) with this change, not of person, but on way of thinking. Echenique, together with Teresa Rodr\u00edguez, were the only ones to confront Pablo Iglesias in the running for the head of the political party. Pablo Iglesias team thought that a \"electoral war machine\" (a kind of aggressive and vertical way of manage the relations internally and externally) were the path to get it right in the elections, it was not on the long run.  The basis, the \"core\" of the initial support, the quincemayistas (people that massively rise against government on may 15th 2011) were clearly against this way of managing the political party, a traditional way of \"master and command\" which was precisely what the people protested about. But Pablo Iglesias was a media popular talk show guest at the time of the election and their number two Errej\u00f3n (and presumably Pablo Iglesias as well) thought that TV talk shows were enough to win both the people and the election.  That might be truth at the beginning, but was clearly the wrong path for the future, as the \"basis\" or the core, in a political party are the \"engine of hope\" and the ones that stick the political banners on the walls, and those \"basis\" voted with a sick feeling as \"there is no other better option\" in past December elections. But time passed by and the selfishness continued, and that was enough for many. Voting poll consistently showed a decline in vote intention and people started to leave. But now, things are starting to be different, Echenique's appointment, a man with a consensus mind, a scientific with non false humility manners, may be the man to re-joint forces, internally and externally. His appointment must be ratified by the Citizen's Council of Podemos, and I foresee wide support. That is why I changed my forecast positively towards and advance in the chances of Podemos to form part of a new hypothetical government, and I also forecast a rise in the polls vote intention in http://elelectoral.com/encuesta-media/ (average of polls vote intention of different sources). On the other side, a new PSOE's congress that changes their leadership from Pedro to Susana and also a new leader in the PP Soraya instead of Mariano, before a new general elections happens, may ease substantially the big coalition of PSOE, PP and Ciudadanos.

I don't see Citizens supporting any pact watered down enough to  attract Podemos (and Podemos has already voted against the Citizens-PSOE platform).   Such a pact would be a huge victory for Podemos and the PSOE, but would likely forever tarnish Citizens with centrist and centre-right reformist voters. I also don't see Sanchez supporting a minority government (let alone a grand coalition) led by Rajoy.  Rajoy would have to step down first, and he is not acting like he is ready to go (though the party could insist).  There is still a small chance that Citizens asks for the investiture and gets informal support of both the PP and PSOE.  I think this would only happen if the PP wanted to delay elections (to fall 2016 or spring 2017 rather than 26 June '16) and give the party time to clean house and find an alternative to Rajoy.

The leader of Spain\u2019s Socialist party won just 131 votes in the 350-seat legislature, just one more than he obtained two days earlier.

Political leaders now have another two months to explore alternative alliances, but if their efforts come to nothing \u2014 as is widely expected \u2014 the king will dissolve parliament and call a new election. According to Mr Rajoy, the most likely date for a repeat ballot is June 26.\n[...]\nThe vote means that Mr S\u00e1nchez has now lost the mandate to form a government, at least for the time being. The king could theoretically hand that task to another party leader in the days and weeks ahead, though it remains unclear whether anyone stands a better chance of winning a governing majority. Mr Rajoy commands the largest bloc in parliament \u2014 with 123 deputies \u2014 but his party has been rocked by a fresh wave of corruption allegations, making the PP an unpopular partner for rival parties.\n~~~~ COMMENT: It's too bad the King can't just meet with all the leaders and then determine that it's best just to call the election now.

PP SAYS 'NO': The PP replied that it would vote still be voting 'no' to the deal, labelling it \"frivolous\" and calling Albert Rivera \"the PSOE's crutch\". \"They know they cannot reform the Constitution without the PP, and they still want to exclude 7 million Spaniards\". It is all \"an advertising operation \u2026 to fool Spaniards\". They ran with the hash tag #PactoDePerdedores, or #LosersDeal. NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP: With a 'no' from Podemos and a 'no' from the PP, the maths won't work, however much the PSOE and Ciudadanos try to sell the deal. PSOE + Ciudadanos adds up to 130 'yes' votes, while the PP and Podemos 'no' votes add up to 192.

But Ciudadanos is unlikely to cast its lot and unblemished reputation with a PP led by Mr. Rajoy. The price of preserving the Prime Minister\u2019s economic reforms may well be his own political future.\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/spains-reform-crucible-1455755554"], [306, "2016-02-18T17:20:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2016-02-18T13:55:13Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [98, "2016-02-18T02:43:08Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [12591, "2016-02-18T00:27:18Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [691, "2016-02-18T00:26:42Z", [0.03, 0.01, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [361, "2016-02-17T23:40:50Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [12268, "2016-02-17T23:14:56Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.25, 0.35], ""], [306, "2016-02-17T21:09:08Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [14258, "2016-02-17T20:50:50Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [20082, "2016-02-17T20:18:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [6552, "2016-02-17T20:08:15Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [755, "2016-02-17T18:59:42Z", [0.08, 0.02, 0.0, 0.9], "Deutsche Welle, February 12, PSOE nixes join with PP; lessens chance that CUID will team up, 'Spain's Socialist Sanchez rejects Rajoy as coalition partner': http://www.dw.com/en/spains-socialist-sanchez-rejects-rajoy-as-coalition-partner/a-19045950\nReuters, February 15, PSOE given deadline of March 3 by Parliment, 'Spanish parliament gives Socialists until March 3 to present government': http://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-idUSKCN0VO131\nSticking points between PSOE and POD remain; talks with CUID and Catalonia.\nClips from above article:\n'According to a survey by polling firm GAD3 on Sunday, 58 percent of Spaniards believe fresh elections will take place.'\nAlso, POD and CUID would do better in fresh elections:\n'According to projections in a second part of the GAD3 survey, released on Monday, the PP and Socialists would lose seats to Podemos and liberal Ciudadanos in a new election, though parliament would remain as fragmented as it is now.'\nAdjusting.\n"], [10759, "2016-02-17T17:31:06Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [4634, "2016-02-17T17:29:46Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [10192, "2016-02-17T15:39:46Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [10039, "2016-02-17T12:13:43Z", [0.07, 0.03, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [19311, "2016-02-16T23:43:00Z", [0.06, 0.01, 0.0, 0.93], ""], [691, "2016-02-16T22:41:30Z", [0.04, 0.01, 0.0, 0.95], ""], [12837, "2016-02-16T22:15:03Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.0, 0.98], ""], [18879, "2016-02-16T21:29:55Z", [0.08, 0.01, 0.0, 0.91], ""], [24, "2016-02-16T21:02:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15097, "2016-02-16T20:55:31Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [11800, "2016-02-16T20:26:50Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.0, 0.84], "After last Monday's news, I see the chances very slim for Podemos to be accepted by PSOE .

Feb 10: \"Spain: Political stalemate in Madrid\" --> http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/27b93f7c-ce67-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377.html#axzz3zpwmkpFB The political manoeuvres may seem bewildering and inconsequential to outsiders. Lurking behind the Madrid deadlock, however, are profound challenges that have become alarmingly familiar to policymakers in the rest of Europe and beyond. These range from discontent with the establishment and the rise of populist movements to the decline of the middle class and soaring inequality. They include anger at political corruption and the loss of faith in key institutions, as well as the resurgence of separatist movements and fears over territorial division.\n[...]\nJust how hard it is to navigate Spain\u2019s political map is clear when considering Mr S\u00e1nchez\u2019s options. The Socialists command 90 seats in the 350-seat legislature, their worst result in modern times. To become prime minister, he needs the support or acquiescence of at least two parties and possibly a few more. Mr S\u00e1nchez has made clear that his priority is to wrap up a deal quickly with the centrist Ciudadanos party but even that alliance would leave him 46 votes short of a majority. The anti-austerity Podemos movement has challenged the strategy, insisting it will not back Mr S\u00e1nchez if he allies with Ciudadanos. The leaders of Ciudadanos, meanwhile, have ruled out any deal with the Socialists that relies on the support of Podemos.\n[...]\nThe result is a heavily fragmented parliament accompanied by paralysing fear and mistrust between the parties. Ciudadanos is painfully aware that its support could be swallowed up by a resurgent PP. The Socialists know that Podemos wants to replace them on the Spanish left and Podemos knows the Socialists will defend their turf. ~~ Feb 10: \"Session to name Spain\u2019s next PM may take place in early March\" --> http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/02/10/inenglish/1455095838_126960.html Sources close to the Socialist secretary general have said he is planning to hold the investiture debate on the week of February 29 to March 4. This falls within the period of one month that he requested from Congress to seek to build enough consensus for a successful bid. S\u00e1nchez has been racing to meet other political leaders in order to find enough common ground for an alliance that could take the form of a full-fledged governing coalition or simply a yes vote, or even abstention, at the investiture session. If S\u00e1nchez were to fail, and no other candidate succeeds in getting voted in, Spain would be forced to hold a fresh election later this year.\n[...]\nBoth the PP and anti-austerity party Podemos have been trying to hold the session earlier. Podemos deputies Gloria Elizo and Marcelo Exp\u00f3sito, who sit on the presiding committee, said that \u201cit does not send a good message to citizens when we push back the deadlines and delay the decision sine die, as it creates unnecessary concern.\u201d In the meantime, acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy and his team are working on a document to show Albert Rivera, the leader of emerging party Ciudadanos, when both men hold talks on Thursday. On Friday, Rajoy will take the same material to his scheduled meeting with S\u00e1nchez in Congress. The crux of his message will be the convenience of a grand coalition made up of all three parties, which he describes as respectful of the Constitution and \u201cwith a moderate agenda.\u201d The PP leader wants to come up with a specific list of proposals that both S\u00e1nchez and Rivera could accept ideologically. But the latter two have already been drafting a working paper of their own. ~~~~ COMMENT: If someone has the time, it might actually be fun to play out the different scenarios with game theory.

In Spain, the US system would result in the party leaders determined in remote portions of Extramadura etc.  I continue to predict that the PSOE party barons, rank and file, view an alliance with Rajoy, as an alliance with Franco's heirs. That is why Felipe Gonzales resigned as PSOE chairman. That link was included earlier. \nSo this question should be resolved within a week, but no time limit. Either a grand PPP and PSOE coalition that has the potential for taking the PSOE and neutering same, leaving Podemos as party of  left. Pure proportional representation will result in a stalemate when the  2 new insurgent parties obtain a sizeable vote and view the maintstream alternatives as corrupt.

After the Greek debt crisis (Stage 1) it joined  the main conservative party after a hung election. where it received its fewest votes ever. Next election supplanted by Syriza,Paesok ceases to exist ( as a main party).  Whatever the outcome, it seems that Cuidadanos and Podemos will emerge as the 2 main winners, especially in oppostion  attacking a lame grand coalition between irreconcilable ideological adversaries.   When the PSOE's Felipe Gonzalez who  led PSOE as a center left party in Spain's  transition to democracy,  resigns as Party Chairman,  the long term prognosis forPSOE is neqative.\nThe whole raison detre for the PSOE is to fight PPP not join it.

The team has looked into and advise you to use your best judgment and follow the wording of the question in conjunction with the forecasting window. The FAQ (https://www.gjopen.com/faq#resolution9) provides some additional guidance on this situation; I.E. that the end date will be extended again if there is still no outcome.\"\n~~ And here's the content from FAQ #9 (the one referenced): If the question itself specifies a deadline (i.e. Will North Korea conduct a missile test before 1 January 2016) then events that occur after the deadline will not count. Some questions do not include a specific deadline; in those cases, GJ sets a likely closing date. For example, questions about election outcomes often have a provisional end date set to coincide with the election date. However, if the question is not resolved by then (e.g., parties take additional time to negotiate before naming a Prime Minister) the end date can, and will, be pushed back. In all cases the question will be closed as of 11:59 PT on the day prior to the event occurring. See above for more details on deadlines. ~~~~~ COMMENT: I remember reading all the FAQs when we first started here, so maybe they've been updated since the last time I checked that page (wish GJ would have included an announcement to letting us know). Re: the mechanics of this IFP -- it looks like this IFP will be extended until there is a 'result' (i.e. a coalition government or a new election). Except, now that I think about it, I'm not sure about the \"new election\" option. I've submitted another clarification request for that and will let you know what I hear. I'd expect that a new election would close *this* IFP and we'd then have a new one, but maybe I'm wrong. Re: the content of this IFP -- Podemos, from all that I've read in the last week or so, seems to be holding all the cards. Here's one link that sums up the state of play succinctly: Feb 5: \"Spain election: Podemos request sees talks deadlocked\" --> http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35502227 Spain's Socialists (PSOE) have rejected a demand from the anti-austerity Podemos party for exclusive talks to form a new government. The country remains in a political stalemate following December's inconclusive election. On the request of King Felipe VI, PSOE leader Pedro Sanchez has been leading talks with other parties. But Podemos (We Can) leader Pablo Iglesias demanded that he stop speaking with centrist Ciudadanos (Citizens). \"Our negotiating team will be ready as soon as the Socialists opt for a government of progress,\" Reuters quoted him as saying. The move followed a survey on Thursday that showed Podemos would come second in a new national election, overtaking the Socialists. Despite coming first in the election with close to 29% of the vote, acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the conservative Popular Party (PP) lacks the support to form a government. Mr Sanchez said he would continue to talk with all parties except the PP and called for Mr Iglesias to reconsider his demand. The El Pais newspaper quoted him as saying: \"There are things that divide us, but one thing unites us all: we have to end the government of Mariano Rajoy and the PP.\" Mr Sanchez earlier pledged to form a \"progressive and reformist\" government. Podemos, Ciudadanos and smaller regional parties hold the balance of power in Spanish politics, which has been dominated for decades by the PP and PSOE. If no working government can be formed, a fresh general election will be called. ~~~~ COMMENT: So, as I was saying, it looks like Podemos is holding all the cards. The PSOE (Socialists) can't form government with Ciudadanos and (other) as their total seat will only reach 158. The only way for PSOE to form government is with PP (which they seem ardently against) or some coalition including Podemos. If Podemos is saying they won't play ball unless the PSOE dump Ciudadanos, well, then there's very little chance that Ciudadanos is part of the coalition (unless PSOE negotiates something else with Podemos to include Ciudadanos).  If I had to guess, I'd say that this stalemate is probably moving to another election or a coalition with PSOE/Podemos. The fact that the PSOE might slip to the \"third party\" might motivate it to get something done with Podemos before forcing Spain to go back to the polls."], [13997, "2016-02-06T06:14:39Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [14672, "2016-02-05T19:20:03Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.45], ""], [691, "2016-02-05T17:32:55Z", [0.2, 0.01, 0.0, 0.79], "I probably shouldn't have come down on this, since it still looks like several-way hopeless impasse.

A grand coalition with Rajoy\u2019s Partido Popular (PP) would essentially mean political suicide for PSOE. In addition, a few influential Socialist regional leaders \u2013 notably including Andalusia\u2019s Susana D\u00edaz \u2013 have categorically rejected an alliance with the anti-establishment Podemos as long as the latter continues to support a binding independence referendum in Catalonia. \" . . . this \u2018neither PP nor Podemos\u2019 line would make re-run elections inevitable. At that point, S\u00e1nchez would likely have to give way to a different Socialist candidate and PSOE may well fare worse than in the 20 December . . .  \"Potentially, the \u2018third way\u2019 for PSOE could be to abstain in the initial confidence vote and let Rajoy enter office with a minority government. In theory, this would give the Socialists greater influence \u2013 as PP would need their support to pass legislation. It would also shield PSOE from accusations of acting irresponsibly by pushing Spain towards re-run elections. However, this option has also been ruled out by PSOE for the time being \u2013 and it remains unclear whether Rajoy would agree to anything less than a fully-fledged coalition. More generally, while it would avoid re-run elections, this would hardly be a stable solution in the longer term. Ultimately, even if PSOE abstained from the initial confidence vote, it would face pressure to back Rajoy every time legislation needs to be passed. It is easy to see how such an arrangement could quickly run into trouble. \"So far, the main hurdle to an alliance between PSOE and Podemos has been the latter\u2019s willingness to allow a binding independence referendum in Catalonia. Similarly, this appears to be the key reason why Ciudadanos has said that it would vote against any government involving Podemos. However, the political scenario in Catalonia could be changing in the coming weeks \u2013 and this might have an impact at the national level. \"admittedly very hypothetical \u2013 scenario. Podemos could drop its independence referendum \u2018red line\u2019 and put greater emphasis on social issues when setting out its conditions for a pact with PSOE. Ciudadanos could then consider abstaining in the initial confidence vote and allow a PSOE-Podemos government to enter office. At the end of the day, all three parties have been campaigning on the need for \u2018change\u2019 in Spanish politics. In other words, with the Catalan stumbling block (somewhat) out of the way, perhaps Rajoy\u2019s worst nightmare could start looking like more than just fantasy politics material. \"That said, this is all very speculative and several big questions would certainly arise. Would Podemos be prepared to give up on such an important pledge with a new Catalan regional election on the horizon?

It has been more than two weeks since the public took to the polls and yet a new government still seems a long way off. A pact between the PSOE, Podemos and Catalan nationalists is now the only option to find a prime minister before that deadline. If that is not forthcoming then King Felipe will be asked to take centre stage as the broker of a deal to form a government. Should no government be in place on January 13, then the King will select a candidate to take the prime minister\u2019s seat. The King\u2019s choice will then be put to the senate and if his chosen man secures the backing of 176 MPs then Spain will have a new government. If, however, the King\u2019s choice proves unpopular with the senate then the ballot-boxes will be wheeled out once more and the public will be asked to cast its vote for a second time. However, up until January 13 Pedro Sanchez and his PSOE party hold the key to power in Spain. With the election producing the first hung parliament since the advent of democracy 40 years ago, incumbent Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has found friends hard to come by, as one-by-one each party leader has ruled out pacting with the PP. And so, the PSOE and Sanchez now face the tough choice of allying with a rival or forcing a new election. The PSOE leader has already categorically ruled out a political pact with Mariano Rajoy and the PP, following a 45-minute meeting with the acting prime minister. He also said that a second election in the event of no government being formed would be \u2018the last option\u2019. With business-minded Ciudadanos saying it would abstain in a parliamentary vote, the PSOE have been left with two options: to pact with Podemos or to allow the deadline to pass and risk the possibility of being blamed for a re-election. It would be fair to say that Sanchez has been shoved between a rock and a hard place, with neither option open to him extremely attractive. Turning to the left to form a government is a profound political choice, likely to divide party members and determine the PSOE\u2019s fate for many years to come. Yet, failing to pact at all will lead to accusations of destabilising the country, as the party will no doubt be blamed for forcing new elections through its refusal to ally. Despite being openly against new elections, Sanchez will be reluctant to jump into office with Pablo Iglesias and his newly-emerged political powerhouse Podemos. The surprise package of the election, Podemos grabbed 69 seats in their first ever general election, changing the face of Spanish politics in the process. A large portion of Podemos backers are likely to be former-PSOE voters, who won just 90 seats \u2013 their lowest ever total. Therefore a PSOE-Podemos coalition would likely be popular with the voters.\nHowever, should Sanchez pact, it would not go down so well among his own party members. First of all, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias is insisting on a Catalan independence referendum as a condition for a deal, which would be difficult for the Socialists to agree to given their current stance against an independent Catalunya. If the PSOE ally with Podemos, they also run the risk of being gobbled up by the fast-growing new party and losing leadership of the left for good. However, they haven\u2019t got much time to make their minds up, as if they are to pact then Sanchez needs to get his skates on, with January 13 approaching ever-so quickly. Whatever happens, compromises will have to be made and a large portion of voters (and politicians) are likely to be unhappy with the outcome.

That would give her the opportunity to replace him as a leader \u2014 either in the midst of coalition talks or, possibly, just months before a snap election.

Instead, the Spanish leader suggested at a news conference on Tuesday that he would simply wait until Socialist party leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who so far has vowed to stand in the way, changes his mind. Such a strategy could keep Mr. Rajoy in office during a postelection political stalemate well into next year.\n[...]\nSince then, Mr. Rajoy has met separately with his three rivals and won implicit support only from Ciudadanos. Its leader, Albert Rivera, has signaled the party would abstain rather than vote in parliament to block Mr. Rajoy\u2019s re-election. The incumbent would need the Socialists to follow suit to win a second term.\n[...]\nWorried a stalemate would lead to a new election and more uncertainty, Spain\u2019s business and media establishment has urged a three-way alliance among the Popular Party, the Socialists and Ciudadanos.\n~~~~ COMMENT: So... my suspicion is that the time on this IFP will expire before a \"grand coalition\" can form (if it does form). I think the most likely option, PM Rajoy convinces the Socialists and Ciudadanos to abstain (allowing Rajoy to form government).

I hope this analysis helps everyone with their probabilities, but keep in mind that I'm still very ignorant of Spanish politics. The sources (see below) answer a question I had for a while: Yes, there can be a minority coalition government. But, any party or coalition must win a vote of confidence in the parliament. If the party/coalition has a majority of seats, then that task is easy. A straightforward party-line vote would do it. If not, the minority coalition can be blocked by the parties that were not invited to form a government. On the first vote, the coalition must win an absolute majority. On the second vote, merely a plurality. So, technically, one or more parties not invited into the government can merely abstain and that should be enough to allow a minority government to form. I rank the scenarios in order of likelihood. It's really just a compilation of the expert opinion and statements of party leaders cobbled together from various sources. It's still highly speculative, though. 1. Deadlock. PP governs alone with Rajoy as president (caretaker government). Likely. This scenario will lead to new elections (likely in March). 2. Coalition of losers. PSOE + Podemos + Popular Unity + regional parties (majority coalition government). Unlikely. Podemos & the Catalan nationalists require a referendum on secession as a precondition to joining a government. Such a referendum is anathema to PSOE's base in southern Spain, which is very much against Catalan secession. PSOE would alienate its voters and future electoral prospects there if they agreed to these terms. For Podemos, joining a government is a bad idea as it would alienate their own base and undermine their goal of replacing PSOE (just as Syriza replaced PASOK) as the major party on the Left. Both PSOE and Podemos have a lot to lose politically. On the other hand, I don't believe Pedro Sanchez has ruled it out. My sense is that the Socialists are eager to rule, so I wouldn't rule out this possibility. 3. PP + Cuidadanos (minority coalition government). Very unlikely. A natural coalition. However, Alberto Rivera has said he would not join a PP-led government because he wanted to avoid the fate of Nick Clegg and the UK's Liberal Party. So, he would rather have his party remain in the opposition. We'll see. If Cuidadanos stands to lose votes to the PP in the next election and PP sweetens the deal, they may relent. This last point is my own speculation. Even if Cuidadanos agrees to join a government, PP still needs the abstention of Podemos or PSOE to form a government. I don't think that will happen. 4. PSOE + Podemos (minority coalition government). Very unlikely. Same reasons as #3. In addition, Cuidadanos has said it will vote against any coalition that includes Podemos. So, this scenario may require the abstention of PP. 5. PSOE + Cuidadanos (minority coalition government) or PSOE + Cuidadanos + Podemos (majority coalition government). Extremely unlikely, Both are unnatural coalitions. For the former, the same reasons as #2. The latter is a mathematically possible majority government that has no realistic chance of happening. Unfortunately, I did not fully realize this until very recently and assigned way too high a probability to the \"BOTH\" outcome. 5. Grand coalition. PP + PSOE (majority coalition government). Extremely unlikely. Unprecedented. Both the Socialists and Conservatives have a lot to lose from this coalition. The Socialists more so as they will be the junior partner. That scenario would leave Cuidadanos and Podemos as the only alternatives to what is likely to be an unpopular government. Politically, it would be a dream scenario for the two outsider parties that are trying to topple the two-party system. Plus, Sanchez has already ruled it out. Let me know if I've made any errors.

I've moved to a 80% probability of a coalition (i.e. 20% for None) - although unprecedented, the electoral maths just doesn't work without at least two parties working together. Also, there is perception that the country is struggling, hence the need for a break from the norm. The remaining 20% is for the upswing in the economy to sway the undecideds to inch PP over the line to a minority government. Interestingly the bookies very much reckon that PP are going to get the most seats in the Congress of Deputies. Another coalition possibility that I'm now considering is PP + CUID + various other parties, although the coalition most likely to have enough votes according to the simulation source is PSOE-led coalition with both.

Minority governments have worked in Spain because it's hard to get a vote of no confidence through (you need to propose an alternative candidate, too), and PSOE, who ran them most recently, could rely upon several similar small parties to support them on a vote-by-vote basis.

Any party regularly contributing a significant chunk of votes is surely going to want to be part of the government, setting the agenda. Hence, I've moved my probability of a coalition up to 70%. However, on the no side, coalition building is somewhat fraught, and it could just result in multiple elections until there is a clear winner. While this has happened in other European countries, my initial guess is that Spain is too big for this to happen, but I might revisit this. I think something that might be weighing upon the smaller parties, particularly CUID, is the cautionary tale of the Lib Dems in the UK, who were punished electorally this year. Taking a closer look at the polling data, and how it translates into seats, PSOE would need both POD and CUID to get a majority, while PP would just need CUID. Hence, I'm now discounting the probability of POD solely being in a coalition. Otherwise probabilities are in line with bookie odds and probability of coalition, as per my original prediction.

A significant fact is that there has never been a coalition government in Spanish politics since the transition to democracy in the late 70s. When insufficient votes exist, parties have prefered to run minority governments. However, this election is unprecedentedly tight, with opinion polls putting the big parties with only 55% of the vote between them, as opposed to ~80% of the vote in the past.  A minority government with ~30% of the vote would struggle, although other sorts of deals could be made, that while not formally in a coalition, parties with shared priorities could vote together. To be honest, I don't know enough about Spanish politics to translate this into a good probability yet, but this looks enough like what happened in the UK General Election in 2010 to make me think a coalition has a more than even chance - 60%.  This is something I will try revisit in future forecasts, along with any changes that might occur in the opinion polling. For example there could be a consolidation around the major parties, after people have been flirting with other candidates. Next, to work out the probabilities of possible coalition membership, I'm using betting odds for most seats in the Congress of Deputies as to which party will be the senior partner, and hence which of these two parties are likely to be a junior party. As of today, 1 November, the bookies' odds have it ~82% that the currently ruling Partido Popular (PP) will get the most votes, and hence will more likely be in a position to form a coalition. Again, something to keep an eye on in the future. Podemos (POD), being anti-austerity and indeed starting due to the unpopularity of PP's policies, are unlikely to shack up with them. The Ciudadanos (CUID) on the other hand, while more centrist than the PP, are mostly focused on opposing the Catalan nationalists. Hence, provided the PP agree to impede the independence movement, CUID could join them. A further argument in favour of CUID joining a coalition would be that the leader was apparently affiliated with the PP prior to joining the CUID. Hence, 82% of 60% is the 49% chance of CUID joining a PP-led coalition. On the other hand, the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE), the other main party have enough in common with POD ideologically that they could work together. And given PSOE's preference for devolution to regions, it's unlikely that the CUID would be keen on working with them, despite shared stated policies. I'm less sure of that last factor, but for now I'm going with the 18% of 60% being a 11% chance of POD joining a PSOE-led coalition. I might split this, to allow for a coalition with both in it.

With a mix of progressive liberalism and social democracy, and a message of democratic regeneration, Ciudadanos has allied itself with both the PP and the PSOE at the regional level after forcing would-be premiers to sign a list of anti-corruption measures, something that has appealed to voters given the series of scandals that has hit the main parties in recent years. \"The PP believes that such an agreement with Ciudadanos at a national level in the wake of the December elections is perfectly viable, but it wants to anticipate a possible demand from the party, led by Albert Rivera: \u201cThe head of Rajoy is untouchable.\u201d That is the \u201cred line\u201d that has been drawn by three different members of the PP\u2019s leadership.

That is where Pedro S\u00e1nchez is hoping to do battle with Ciudadanos and win votes that have gone to another new party, leftist anti-austerity group Podemos. The Socialists are aiming to push Albert Rivera\u2019s party to the right, painting them as \u201cmodern and affable, but right-wing.\u201d \"An opinion poll published at the weekend, and carried out by Metroscopia, reveals that Ciudadanos will play a decisive role at the general elections. The group is forecast to take 21.5 percent of the vote, narrowly losing out to the PP, with 23.4 percent, and the PSOE, with 23.5 percent. New leftist anti-austerity party Podemos, meanwhile, would take 14.1 percent of the vote, according to the opinion poll. \"The poll predicts, then, that the Socialists would win the elections but in a virtual tie with the PP. The five percentage points that Ciudadanos have gained since the last survey, released just a month ago, would give the party a decisive roll in the political scene that would be revealed in the wake of the December polls. \"On September 27, Ciudadanos won 18 percent of the votes at the Catalan regional elections, taking 25 seats in parliament. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If I understand it correctly, the PP will invite Ciudadanos to be its coalition partner, and the PSOE/Socialists will invite Podemos.
