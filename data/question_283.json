For example, the fact that on previous winners, approximately 80% of the protagonists were male implies that this year's shortlisted novels that have a male protagonists stand an 0.80 probability of winning  (all other things being equal). Or such an association is in fact irrelevant and the judges will not be influenced by the gender of the protagonist? Although the judges will be biased, It is hard to imagine that their bias will be along these lines, and more likely there will be other factors that constitute their criteria for the \"best original novel\". The betting shops [2] consensus favourite was Hot Milk (~0.5) and their least favourite Eileen (~0), the rest shared equally the remaining of the odds. In contrast, the GJO consensus was on Do Not Say We Have Nothing (0.44) and His Bloody Project (0.33). This presented a considerable difference.
