Some factors that may give insight include shared opponents, strength and weakness within matchups, etc.   Considering the OSU-Clemson matchup first - Scoring Offense and Scoring Defense statistics are a virtual dead heat.  OSU is 2.2 pts per game higher on Scoring O, Clemson has 1.9 pts per game lower on Scoring D.  There is a potential argument to be made regarding the quality of the opponents in this game with OSU playing teams that were ranked 8, 8, 13, 13, and 25 at the time of the game while Clemson's wins against ranked teams were against 12 early in the season and 23 at the end.  Intangibles in this game will be key and thus fairly difficult to predict.  Individual matchups and day of performances will be the deciding factor.  No shared opponents to help here - This game goes to OSU but only 60% to 40%. On the LSU, OKL side - the statistics and pundits all seem to point toward LSU.  LSU's scoring Offense statistics are 4 pts high than OKL and scoring defense is also 3.3 pts lower.  The LSU statistics were also accumulated against higher quality competition: 9, 7, 9, 3, 4 vs. 11, 13, 21, 7.  Both teams played and beat Texas by a touchdown in the first half of the season, so no real indicators there. I would give LSU the large edge in this one 90% to 10%.   Following the matchups this puts OSU against LSU in the final.  OSU's scoring Offense is only slightly higher than LSU, but defensively there is a wide gap of 8.7 pts.  Again, no shared opponents to help with this.  The quality of competition edge tilts toward LSU here and they get the nod 60% to 40%.
