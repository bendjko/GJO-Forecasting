This approach may end up with a different answer because the consensus seems to be think that there is a lot of potential cost savings as a result of manufacturing improvements.  However, more than half of the cost of the battery is based on the price of the Annode & Cathode chosen. Here is my distribution of battery production cost (2016):\nCathode (Lithium):   28%\nAnode (Graphite):    24%\nLabor:                        15%\nAssembly:                 12%\nElectrolyte:                  8%\nSeparator:                   5% So you can see, that there are only a few areas where you can truly \"squeeze\" improvements at this point, and everything else is simply going to be the price of the Electrodes.   Now of course, the choice of Electrodes matters, and this probably where the real cost savings may take place Cathode Alternatives: Cost - Life (Market Share 2016)\nLMO (LiMn2O4): Low - Low  (7%)\nLCO (LiCoO2): Modest - Modest (32%)\nNMC (LiNiMnCoO2): High - High (25%)\nLFP (LiFePO4): High - Medium (20%)\nNCA (LiNiCoAlO2): High - Medium (11%)\nOther (eg, Titanate): (5%) So there is always a trade-off in terms of pricing and energy.  As such, the mix of market share will matter.  In many cases the transition to the lower cost LCO from NMC is really where most of the cost savings have spawned.  This trend will likely continue as NMC is great for \"testing\" but not good for actual production and profits. So that's the cost savings, but here's the catch, the cost of the components of LCO has grown exponentially.  Lithium for example has surged 200% from 2014, and 50% from 2016.   That is: $5k / ton in 2014, to $9k / ton at yr end 2016, to around $14k/ton today\nPricing has gotten so wild in lithium that Tesla is actually investing in a lithium mine outside of Nevada.   Similarly, Graphite is up 25% since the beginning of the year.   Putting all these components together suggests that pricing of for the electrodes of a battery produced today should be up roughly 20% (21.6% to be precise).   Using the 5/8th rule (i.e., total revenues/expenses resulting from growth between a prior period to today's prices only reflect 5/8th of the difference), suggest that for the year, pricing should be up 13.5%. This almost entirely wipes out the cost savings trend from the prior result.  Including a modest shift in market share to cheaper batteries (and the elimination of higher cost producers: e.g., Tesla Model 3) for production purposes, and the 16% cost savings trend, suggest that pricing should be down 13.5%.   This places the midpoint of the estimate at $249/Kwh, unfortunately right at the cusp of the upper limit.   ---------------------- 11 / 13 / 2017 Update ---------------\nMy first approach tried to identify the real cost of putting together the battery.

There is one estimate from either battery pack replacement costs or a company representative for 4 vehicles , Bolt, Model S, i3, and Nissan Leaf, 2 published by the same author, and 2 from industry analysts.  The things that could potentially affect next years \"estimated average\" which is not the same as \"next year's actual average costs\" are principally:\n1) Tesla Model 3 is new big player and will likely get a \"data point\" and it will be lower than others (PR, reality, competition)\n2) Whether the same individuals are reached to provide such estimates\n3) Whether the numbers provided and published have any precision.  For example, Tesla could change the way they compute average costs reported to analysts via managerial accounting 101.\n4) whether additional studies are published from alternative sources/methods. Given these things, I predict the 8-10% learning rate will continue.  However, year over year estimates provided by Tesla in 2015 and 2016 (from CEO and CTO to investors) show a 12.4% reduction at Tesla, which will represent the reduction of 2/5 expected measurements in next year's reports.  BMW showed a 22% reduction YOY from 2015-2014 which represents 1/5 of the measurements.  If I assume similar decreases reported for BMW and Tesla, and average 8% decreases for Nissan and Chevy (less expectation of major advances given less investments being made) I arrive at an average reported number of $224/kwh.   Assuming next years published reports will be from similar reports, the manufacturer representing sources have more incentive to report lower numbers than higher numbers, so I will skew accordingly.   This of course is not actually the industry's average cost, because each manufacturer is not producing the same quantities.  But given the question and study's methods, this is how I will answer.  Lots of analysis for somewhat questionable data in my opinion.  As an aside, somewhat lackluster depth of investigation for a Wharton institution, but I like the question and will play along."], [691, "2017-08-21T17:06:32Z", [0.01, 0.44, 0.54, 0.01], ""], [34879, "2017-08-21T14:52:53Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [38473, "2017-08-21T05:45:24Z", [0.08, 0.4, 0.5, 0.02], ""], [14237, "2017-08-20T21:16:41Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.25, 0.73], ""], [36631, "2017-08-19T23:35:21Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.15, 0.65], ""], [22264, "2017-08-19T03:56:04Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [38420, "2017-08-19T01:07:42Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [821, "2017-08-18T00:58:15Z", [0.0, 0.42, 0.55, 0.03], "Estimate based on earlier Mack Institute analysis and article posted earlier from Electrek website."], [691, "2017-08-17T14:22:18Z", [0.01, 0.44, 0.54, 0.01], ""], [37474, "2017-08-16T21:27:36Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [691, "2017-08-16T02:02:03Z", [0.01, 0.42, 0.56, 0.01], ""], [27584, "2017-08-15T15:22:37Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.8, 0.1], ""], [12591, "2017-08-14T22:40:26Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [691, "2017-08-14T17:00:13Z", [0.01, 0.42, 0.56, 0.01], ""], [14493, "2017-08-14T15:29:33Z", [0.07, 0.41, 0.47, 0.05], ""], [427, "2017-08-14T01:57:10Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [5578, "2017-08-13T16:04:44Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.3, 0.05], "The gigafactory feeding Tesla should begin to see economies of scale very soon"], [691, "2017-08-13T12:44:21Z", [0.01, 0.42, 0.56, 0.01], ""], [30610, "2017-08-13T09:48:14Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.65, 0.25], ""], [37971, "2017-08-12T19:40:36Z", [0.02, 0.5, 0.4, 0.08], ""], [691, "2017-08-12T15:14:28Z", [0.01, 0.42, 0.56, 0.01], ""], [691, "2017-08-11T19:33:57Z", [0.01, 0.43, 0.55, 0.01], ""], [30396, "2017-08-11T17:30:39Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [37920, "2017-08-11T16:49:36Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.35, 0.55], ""], [691, "2017-08-10T16:00:30Z", [0.01, 0.43, 0.55, 0.01], ""], [15484, "2017-08-10T14:03:59Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.1], "Declining possible efficiency gains"], [619, "2017-08-09T18:31:41Z", [0.65, 0.15, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [691, "2017-08-09T12:03:03Z", [0.01, 0.43, 0.55, 0.01], ""], [36306, "2017-08-08T18:18:58Z", [0.2, 0.65, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [36819, "2017-08-08T16:30:38Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [601, "2017-08-07T17:10:53Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.58, 0.12], ""], [30610, "2017-08-07T08:36:16Z", [0.03, 0.07, 0.65, 0.25], ""], [29648, "2017-08-07T08:32:32Z", [0.01, 0.75, 0.23, 0.01], ""], [19801, "2017-08-05T14:07:07Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.79, 0.11], "The analysts forecast prices for lithium-ion battery modules to tumble below $200/kWh by 2019, enabling previously \u201cuneconomical applications\u201d such as the colocation of battery storage and solar PV to surge.\nhttps://pv-magazine-usa.com/2017/08/03/falling-lithium-ion-battery-prices-to-drive-rapid-storage-uptake/\n"], [20156, "2017-08-05T07:34:19Z", [0.1, 0.43, 0.45, 0.02], ""], [36686, "2017-08-04T18:36:49Z", [0.02, 0.23, 0.65, 0.1], "Long term trends by Bloomberg New Energy and Finance analysis by Energy Finance analyst Claire Curry, plus thoughts on lifespan of production equipment brought on line in 2011 (see previous comment on 6 yr lifespan).
