The five waterways that control the flow of water into the dam are open, after being closed for over 12 years, and Minister Janabi said water levels are now at the highest level since 2005. \"Despite these assurances, experts who have studied the dam structure say it remains far from safe.  \u201cThere is always a chance that water is going to migrate,\u201d said Azzam Alwash, an Iraqi-American civil engineer who has served as an adviser on the dam. He said 24 sinkholes remain in the dam\u2019s reservoir, making it vulnerable to pressure from water flows. \u201cThis is a dam tantamount to a nuclear bomb,\u201d Alwash said. \u201cAre you going to take the risk of keeping your family in a place where it can sink under as much as 15 meters of water in a matter of hours? I\u2019m not.\u201d \"Nadhir al-Ansari, professor of water resources and environmental engineering at Lulea University in Sweden and a published expert on the Mosul Dam, agreed that the risk is serious. \u201cThere is no guarantee the dam will ever be safe. Studies done on the dam all show that its collapse is imminent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe minister may say it\u2019s safe because Iraq is already past the flooding season, which peaks in April and ends in May. You will have the same problem every year in April.\u201d \"To fill the cavities that form underneath the concrete, engineers have injected the dam with more than 50,000 tons of grout, a liquefied mixture of cement and other additives, since it opened in 1986. \u201cThe grouting solution by the Italian company is only a temporary measure for emergency fixes,\u201d al Ansari said. \u201cWhen they block a cavity in one place, it appears in another place.

I considered the following factors in assessing the current risk and how that risk will change by 1 January 2018.  1)  Grouting (injecting void filling material below the dam to decrease the permeability of the dam's foundation)\n2)  Lowering of the hydraulic head (water level of the reservoir contained by the dam)\n3)  Integrity of the structure\n4)  Snow melt in eastern Turkey\n5)  Possible military action against the dam 1)  According to a geologist I talked to, grouting is a common design element of dam construction. So the existence of a grouting regimen is nothing abnormal. The design of the grout curtain/blanket is key to its effectiveness however, and its primary purpose is to slow the velocity of water seeping through and around a dam (all dams are permeable to some extent). The quicker the flow, the more energy the water has to carry away material, which equates to a higher volume of material and individual particles of larger size being transported away from the foundation. Reading the New Yorker article cited below it seems the grout curtain at the Mosul Dam is being applied haphazardly, but the key fault many geologist find with it is actually its design, not its implementation. So the hundred thousand tons of grout used at the dam to date is almost certainly helping, but it's not as effective as it otherwise could be. 2)  Lowering of the hydraulic head decreases pressure on the dam (and also decreases electricity generation) in a linear fashion according to Darcy\u2019s law. Currently, the hydraulic head is 90% lower than it was in 2005, meaning at this point the dam is not even generating significant electricity (which has other implications for the local power grid and for flood control downstream). This has significantly decreased the pressure on the dam structure itself and the velocity of the seepage, but erosion of the dam's foundation can still cause its collapse. 3)  Due to the aggressive erosion of the gypsum foundation, the Mosul Dam has been subject to abnormal movement/shifting, some of which is described in the New Yorker article. However, the lowering of the reservoir described above has probably helped preserve the structure. Again, collapse of the dam will likely come from below, not failure of the structure itself. 4)  The most dangerous time period for the Mosul Dam is the spring, as snow melt flowing into the Tigris floods the reservoir. This usually peaks in March/April/May (see USGS report, page 20, figure 9). Given the already low hydraulic head, the fact that one of the two control gates is still working, and the second is supposed to be repaired under the current maintenance contract with Italian firm Trevi, it would take a truly record snow melt to accelerate foundation erosion to the point of causing the dam's collapse. I found no evidence of abnormally high precipitation this winter in the Tigris river basin north of Mosul. 5)  Rather than natural causes, the dam could be destroyed by a military attack. In 2014, ISIS briefly took control of the dam for five days, and other military operations have since been attempted. While the dam is currently under control of the Iraq government, the nearby city of Mosul is engulfed in heavy fighting. Blowing up the dam would be devastating to residents downriver, which is the type of destruction and publicity a terrorist organization might relish. Even extended capture that would put a halt to the dam's grouting program could inadvertently expedite its demise. According to the New Yorker article however, hundreds of solders now safeguard the dam. The recent push to retake Mosul city should help mitigate some of this threat. Finally, I will quote the geologist I talked to who said, \"The Mosul Dam is rather famous at the moment in Engineering Geology circles, and folks have been looking at it for years ... Most folks I talk to say on a scale of 1 to 10 this dam is at 8 to 9 in terms of requiring some sort of emergency repair.

And I have uncovered information that it has been bombed (by the US, years ago), to little ill effect.  Therefore, I consider sabotage a less likely cause of it collapsing.   My concerns are focused on \n-the lack of clarity about the actual condition of the dam\n-my grave concern about the integrity of the dam that was triggered when I read that a whole segment of the dam has sunk significantly and that so long as one of the outflow gates is malfunctioning, the integrity of the dam is impacted when there's outflow through the other gate.  See http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/409902\n-my lack of confidence that engineering science will prevail when there's political pressure to allow the water level in the dam to rise There's several things that remain open questions for me:\n-theoretically, at some point won't the dam become \"safe\" because all of the soluble rock has been replaced with concrete?  How long will it be before that point is reached?\n-if there's not going to be any warning of imminent collapse, why are they doing pressure tests, monitoring seepage, comparing satellite photos, etc?\n-isn't it possible that a significantly smaller blast than would otherwise be required to cause a dam of this size and composition to collapse could trigger such an event because the dam has less structural integrity than it should? Reading through \"top\" comments, I noted two points that other forecasters have made:  1)  if ISIS thought it could destroy the dam, would it fight so hard to defend Mosul?  2)  Nobody is moving out of the flood zone.   I also note that there seems to be agreement that the only sure solution is to build another dam, downstream.  Yet, this plan is drawing little attention and no funding.  Wouldn't the IMF be loaning money for this purpose if they thought that the Mosul dam really was going to fail soon?

During the Gulf War, American jets bombed its generator but the dam remained intact. 2)  Alwash, an Iraqi-American hydrological engineer, says that \" . . . nearly everyone outside the Iraqi government who has examined the dam believes that time is running out: in the spring, snowmelt flows into the Tigris, putting immense pressure on the retaining wall. 3)  \"Sinkholes were forming around the dam, and pools of water had begun bubbling up on the banks downstream. \u201cYou could see the cracks, you could see the fractures underground,\u201d 4)  \"  satellite photos showed water from the reservoir seeping through the sides of the dam. 5) In Iraq there is a tradition of inertia, begun during Saddam\u2019s dictatorship, in which officials live in fear of being penalized for taking initiative. \u201cIraqis will ignore the problem until the day the dam collapses, . . .  If the boss says there\u2019s no problem, then there is no problem. \u201d 6)  \"It took me more than a hundred phone calls, e-mails, and visits before a single American official was granted permission to speak to me on the record; even then, three other State Department officials listened in on the conversation. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to publicly embarrass the Iraqis,\u201d the senior American official told me. 7)  In January, a team of American scientists reported that a thirty-metre-wide block on the western side of the dam had tilted, with one end sinking into the earth a tenth of an inch. (The State Department has refused to make the report public.) It was the fourth time the dam had moved since November, 2015. To engineers, uneven movement of a dam means that the ground underneath may be falling away; the uneven pressure could ultimately cause a breach. . . .  the dam\u2019s overseer, said that the dam was merely \u201csettling\u201d into the earth. But most dams stop settling within a few months after they are built. Outside experts, including Ansari, told me that for the dam to move that much was highly irregular. \u201cThat\u2019s more than it\u2019s moved in thirty years,\u201d he said. Alwash, the Iraqi civil engineer, told me, \u201cSomething has changed. The underlying soil is readjusting itself because of the voids.\u201d\n\nA second report, also kept from the public, was equally alarming. Like the first, it concluded that sections of the dam were moving unevenly, that water was passing through the foundation rapidly, and that water downstream contained high concentrations of dissolved gypsum\u2014evidence of large voids.\n\n8)  Nadhir al-Ansari, the engineer who made the first inspection of the Mosul Dam, . . . [and] Adamo, the former chief engineer, . . .  remain obsessed with the dam, haunted by decisions made more than thirty years ago. They confer on the phone daily and get together to discuss the situation; they sometimes reach out to engineers who work at the dam. Adamo keeps an up-to-date maintenance log  . . . Neither he nor Ansari is optimistic that the Iraqi government will be able to solve the problem in time. \u201cI am convinced the dam could fail tomorrow,\u201d Adamo said.\n\n9)  The Italian team of engineers from Trevi S.p.A,'s main task is to install updated equipment designed to fill the voids beneath the dam more precisely, and to repair the broken control gate. Under the contract, the Italians will do the grouting for a year, and then leave the equipment with their Iraqi counterparts. The engineers say that they are confident they can prevent the dam\u2019s foundation from washing away.\n\n What I find a bit confusing is that on the one hand they say If there is a breach in the dam, there will be no warning and on the other hand experts are using pressure gauges to detect water flow under the dam,  and site satelite photos which show seepage, sinkholes forming around the dam, pools of water bubbling up on the banks downstream, blocks of the dam settling and moving unevenly, high concentrations of dissolved gypsum in the water downstream and visible cracks and fractures underground as evidence of imminent failure.  The difficulty that the reporter had in getting anyone to speak on the record because of political concerns, and the Iraqi culture of problem denial, suggest to me that there IS a much bigger danger than is officially acknowledged. One curious thing to me is that in all the articles, reference is made to a wall of water should the dam fail.  I suspect that the real damage will occur not as a result of the water,  (i.e. it won't be flood damage)  but as a result of all of the detritus that the water pushes along.

Reading these reports carefully, I do not find any new information.  That means that the dam is not significantly more or less unstable and dangerous today than it was 6 months ago.   So, the question is, is it more at risk for sabotage?   The dam is now being guarded by Italian and Kurdish soldiers, so it is probably the most carefully guarded dam on the planet.  Khalid, a civil engineer and GJO top forecaster and others have said that it would take a gigantic blast to rupture the dam.   Also,  why would ISIS do this now, while it still has thousands of its best fighters in Mosul--all of whom would be killed in the wall of water? Tactically, wouldn't ISIS be probing the dam's defenses?  Has it?  Wouldn't ISIS wait until its fighters had vacated the floodplain?   With only 14 days to go in the first time bin, I am adjusting my forecast down to 0.\nHowever, I've been reading about how ISIS has developed massively more destructive VBIEDs in the last 2 months, so I'm increasing the 2nd bin to 12%:  1% per month. EDIT:  We've seen some pretty incredible things happen in this war:  whole-sale slaughter of civilians using WMD;  deliberate destruction of cultural ruins; the US taking out the bridges in Mosul that everyone feared ISIS would take out; and at least 5 air forces capable of taking out the dam operating in the theater (Russian, Iraqi, French, Turkish, US). . . .

It also seems to possess rockets & large guns, and it knows all about how to build VBIEDs.    By setting oil wells on fire, ISIS has shown itself to not care about causing environmental damage, and by kidnapping people to use as human shields it has demonstrated its lack of care for the people,  so why would it restrain itself from blowing up a dam and wiping out a city or two? This is the kind of question that could close early--in a blink.

Further, this is the least risky time of year.   My writeup on what I think is going on is here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/288080. A few clarifications and thoughts. I keep hearing about terrorism and ISIS trying to attack the dam.  This dam is basically a massive hill made from dirt, about 370 feet tall, 2 miles long, crest is about 35 feet wide, base is something like a half mile wide (i.e., front to back).  The reservoir is being kept significantly below full, thus terrorists would need to remove hundreds of feet wide, and maybe a hundred feet deep of dirt.  With explosives that you can move by truck?  That isn't going to happen.   ISIS could create indirect damage that would further endanger the dam, such as killing engineers and technicians, or destroying more equipment, etc.  But the dam?  No. Next, why is the dam now safe?  They have lowered the level of the reservoir behind the dam to safe levels.  Thus, this year odds of failure are minuscule. Why is the dam going to be in danger next year (specifically, spring)?  Two issues - water inflow and condition of the dam.  One - spring floods tend to fill the Mosul dam reservoir at levels that cannot be controlled (see part Two).  Two (part A), one of the two outlet gates remains broken.  I don't totally know why, but the two gates are designed to work together to minimize erosion of the dam.  However, they have been using only 1 gate for the last few years, and so far have not been able to get the other gate working.  Two (Part B) is that they are STILL not doing maintenance on the dam (as per an excellent article found by @Raahul_Kumar, http://pure.ltu.se/portal/files/107014510/Mosul_Dam_the_Full_Story_Engineering_Problems.pdf), dated last month.  The issue is that in 2014 the engineers and technicians were killed by ISIS or fled, the equipment for pumping grout (cement) was destroyed by ISIS, and even though Iraq captured the dam, ISIS has kept control of the cement plant.  When you need tens to hundreds of tons of cement in one pour, every day, 24/7, you don't do that with sakrete (i.e., Home Depot). Murphy continues to control the Mosul dam.

Not that often though.  Dams also seem to collapse in the late fall and spring.  Dams collapse for a variety of reasons.  Poor maintenance, extreme inflow, earthquakes, geological instability, and poor construction a few reasons for Dam collapsing.  Dams have also collapsed by deliberate means.  The British in World War 2 bombed several Dams under code name Operation Chastise.  The Mosul Dam is an interesting study.  This Dam is located in a conflict zone, it has been poorly maintained, and it was built on porous earth.  I asked a former employee of the Bureau of Reclamation and he said the Mosul Dam reminded him of the Teton Dam that collapsed in June 1976.  Both the Teton and the Mosul Dams are earth-fill type Dams with very porous foundations.    There is a law called Darcy\u2019s Law it describes the flow of fluids through porous mediums. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law  I first read about this law while researching the Teton Dam failure http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/teton_dam/Background%20on%20Teton%20Dam%20Failure.pdf  Once \u201ceffective stress\u201d has occurred the Mosul Dam should collapse.  Effective stress would occur when enough water has filled the Mosul Reservoir and that pressure forces water through the porous sediment then causing the collapse. Recently the Mosul Dam has reported that the water levels are down and there is less risk for collapse.  I give the natural occurrence for the Mosul Dam to collapse within the next year below 10%.   There is, however, sabotage considerations.  Turkey is just now completing the Ilisu Dam located just north of the Mosul Dam on the Turkish side of the border.  This means water flow to the Mosul Dam should decrease further.  In theory the Mosul reservoir should just dry up.  As the Mosul area dries up and less pressure is placed on the Dam it would not take much water flow from the north to put Darcy\u2019s Law into effect and cause the effective stress required to cause a collapse.   The likelihood of an intentional Mosul Dam collapse is small but still a possibility.  I do not understand all the geopolitics currently going on with Russia, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq, US, Europe, Kurds, ISIS and NATO.  But I bet one or more of the above would benefit from a Mosul Dam collapse.  I can see the Mosul Dam collapsing in the fog of war.  For this reason I\u2019m changing my forecast to 20/40/40.  I am also forecasting that Mosul will not be recaptured until next year.

Recognizing that deviation from expectations (Why not simply a photo of the shrine?) indicates that there is a causal mechanism at play which I had not anticipated, and begs for an explanation.  So, assuming nothing happens without cause, why might the photo of the Mosul dam be included with an article about the \"collapse\" of a Jewish shrine? a) The innocent explanation 1: A simple error. The photo editor pulled the wrong photo by mistake, and it passed through editorial proofing undetected. b) The innocent explanation 2: The photo editor, or whomever the decision-maker was, had no photo of the shrine on file and had a pre-existing mental association between the dam and the shrine, which association centered on their sharing the property of \"potential collapse.\" (This explanation requires the assumption that out of an unrestricted universe of photos [since no photo of the particular shrine presumably was on file] this particular association, out of all possible associations, was considered most informative, or best, or whatever. Quite a coincidence that out of the unlimited universe, this particular association, and our Mosul dam, was selected. Why not other shrines that have collapsed? Or just other ancient shrines? Or a picture of the local city where the shrine is located?) c) The not-so-innocent explanation 1: This is an instance of psychological warfare, which I believe has a very specific label which I do not recall, but that can be generally described as pre-saging psychological framing. That it is so apparent makes it seem, assuming the not-so-innocent explanation applies, almost like a homework exercise for some student in a psy-op 101 course.\nhttp://www.workingpsychology.com/whatfram.html Note that the purpose of this technique is to manipulate salience in order to influence SUBSEQUENT judgment. So, when the dam falls to sabotage, we're all supposed to say, \"Ah yes, it was destined to collapse all along.\" d) The not-so-innocent explanation 2: A veiled threat. Here we'd be catching the glimpse of a communication between two opposing minds that, which, given their circumstances, they can ascribe specific meanings to the message that we, as outsiders, may not fully grasp. Nevertheless, I forecast this question specifically excluding sabotage, and will require that the dam be deemed to have \"fallen down\" without any action intended to \"bring it down\" (or in the parlance of 9/11, to \"pull it\" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jPzAakHPpk )).

It really makes no difference to me whether the cause of the collapse is intentional or unintentional (although I believe most would say that there is some general connotation of unintentionality with the word collapse). It does matter to me, however, that there is an obvious possibility of semantic interpretative segregation in this question, and this would result in some set of mixed forecasts, thus invalidating the meaningfulness of any measure of \"consensus.\" cc: @ravel (narrative); @Anneinak (definition); @morrell (weirdness)"], [484, "2016-08-03T02:56:43Z", [0.01, 0.2, 0.79], "Adjusting middle bucket down 5%."], [26028, "2016-08-03T02:21:17Z", [0.15, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [691, "2016-08-02T20:55:15Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.91], ""], [368, "2016-08-02T18:12:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2016-08-02T17:56:32Z", [0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [14493, "2016-08-02T17:16:00Z", [0.02, 0.08, 0.9], "It seems to be past the point of maximum risk (April/May) for this season so it seems that there is good chance it will last until 2017.

The more I read the worse it got.  A bit of background. The Mosul dam was built in the mid 1980\u2019s on the Tigris River.  The lake behind this dam is the fourth largest in the middle east.   Heaviest flows along the Tigris river occur in March, April and May.   The Mosul dam is basically a thick fin of impervious clay with earth fill upstream and downstream to protect it.  On top of this is a layer of river rock or other material to keep it from weathering.  There is a spillway on the east side (i.e., used when the dam is full), and two bottom outlet gates (to allow release from near the bottom).  One of these two bottom outlet gates is broken, and if they are not used together, they cause unacceptable erosion.  But, the functional one has been used singly for the last 4 years.  Without filling the dam and using the spillway, the only way to remove water from the dam is electric generation and these two bottom outlet gates.  I could not find out why these gates are broken (mechanical issues, design/ installation issues or settling and warpage).  By the way, bombing the dam would be like bombing a hill.  Terrorists probably couldn\u2019t hurt it.  They could damage a lot of equipment, however. The Mosul dam is built upon a karst type rock foundation.  When you read the term karst, think geology that makes caves \u2013 i.e., crap.  It is a mix of limestone that has holes and cracks (sort of like cracked cement) and gypsum (think plaster board).  Gypsum is a water soluble salt, and in the presence of water, it dissolves.  When you put a dam on a river, it creates huge water pressure on the rock around the dam (about 160 psi when full for the Mosul dam.)  Thus, unless something is done to stop it, water is constantly moving through this rock, washing out the dam\u2019s foundation.  There have been huge sink holes opening up in the areas around the dam, I assume where gypsum is washing out.  Huge is defined as 15 meter by 15 meter by 15 meter.  As if this weren\u2019t enough, the area around the reservoir is sinking at about .5 to 1 cm (1/4 inch) per year. This erosion has been dealt with for 3 decades by injecting cement (grout) below the dam from an access tunnel.  ISIL captured the dam the summer of 2014, and grout injection was stopped for a few months.  Upon returning, the engineers and managers found their equipment destroyed, and staff gone.  Thus, even though they are grouting once again, they are not doing so at the frantic pace they did for previous decades. Spring of this year a contract was signed with an Italian firm to manage and fix the dam. Now that we know about the dam, its foundation, the geology, the Tigris\u2019 flow rate, we can make guesses.\nThe dam will move to less risk over the next 9 months, when it will increase risk once again due to snow-melt filling the reservoir. Next year will be the interesting and frightening one.  Assuming the dam remains in Iraq control, assuming they get the two gates opening, assuming they increase grouting and get control of the foundation, assuming politicians don\u2019t insist they keep the reservoir full (it produces more electricity full, but they are trying to keep it 10 meters below full), assuming, assuming.   The Mosul dam has lasted for 30 years, thus so far, risk historically is no higher than 3% per year.  But, as it is today with current damage, I think I will double that to 6%.  6 months left \u2013 so 3% this year.  Next spring (and all springs in the future unless they get the foundation and gates under control) is the risk.  Until they do, doubling the yearly risk once again.  12% next year.
