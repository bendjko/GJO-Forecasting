Trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving Washington on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in January, so he could keep his promise to finish work before Christmas. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you folks to say I wasn\u2019t keeping my promise.

Instead, Congress moved toward a one-month punt that would keep the government funded into January and once again put off policy confrontations. As Republicans celebrated the passage of their tax overhaul at the White House with President Trump, the party\u2019s leaders in the House and Senate worked behind the scenes to shape a stopgap spending measure to fund federal agencies and avert a government shutdown. Only days ago, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would vote for the tax bill because she had secured a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to include two health care provisions to stabilize insurance markets in an end-of-the-year spending measure. On Wednesday, she dropped that demand and said she hoped it would be passed in early 2018. \u201cIt looks like the Christmas present of lower health insurance premiums will now have to be a Valentine\u2019s Day present,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who had joined Ms. Collins\u2019s demand (para. 1-5).
