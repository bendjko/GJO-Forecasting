It seems that if Indiana had not confiscated the vehicle under civil law and instead had done it as part of criminal law, then it would have clearly exercised its right to confiscate property involved in the crime.  As it is now, in my understanding, the case pits a state law versus the federal law, and this SCOTUS will air towards the Indiana SC's ruling.

Under Indiana criminal law, the maximum fine that could be imposed for that particular offense and subsequent conviction is $10,000 and his vehicle is worth 4 times that. If the Eighth amendment is understood to apply to states AND the circumstances of the confiscation are understood to be directly connected, then his claim should be upheld by the SCOTUS.\nThe state of Indiana is arguing that the vehicle was seized under a separate act to his criminal prosecution, in a civil case. Due to TImbs admission while in custody that he routinely used the vehicle to transport heroin, there is a case to be made that the forfeiture of his vehicle was related to confiscation of a vehicle used for illegal activity.  It will be interesting to see how heavily the outsourcing of civil forfeiture cases to private firms with a vested interest in seizing assets will influence the decision in this case.

However, it would seem odd that one could retain property involved in a crime, where guilt is shown (bifurcated nature of standard of proof for the crime and whether the asset was used in connection with the crime proven to have been committed shows that there is a common law preference for restricting the use of assets that can facilitate or are the result of criminal activity), when the forfeiture could be obtained by the state through a civil action without having to meet any standard of personal guilt but merely show that the asset was used in an activity deemed illegal. There is long standing precedent in this regard (civil): \"In that case, a Michigan woman named Tina Bennis fought the seizure of her car after her husband was caught having sex with a prostitute in it.\nFor her part, Bennis argued she had no clue her husband would use the car for the illegal tryst. The high court ruled that didn't matter, citing the following case law:\nIt has long been settled that statutory forfeitures of property entrusted by the innocent owner or lienor to another who uses it in violation of the revenue laws of the United States is not a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\nIn its 1996 decision, the high court pointed to a bizarre line of reasoning it made in its first-ever decision on civil forfeiture handed down back in 1827. That case involved the government's attempt to seize a ship used for piracy. When the owner of the ship claimed it couldn't be forfeited until he'd been convicted of a crime, the Supreme Court had this to say:\nThe thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to the thing. \" http://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/blt/content/2012/06/article-02-dery.shtml See also: http://apps.americanbar.org/buslaw/blt/content/2012/06/article-02-dery.shtml, which notes the remedial nature of civil forfeitures versus the punitive nature in criminal cases.   Thus, it would seem that the vehicle in question would almost certainly be forfeited under a civil proceeding.  Is there compelling rationale to justify the forfeiture in a criminal one?  The difference hinges on how interests are treated among owners.  The case law appears to be rooted in the concept that a person that engages in breaking the law runs the risk of  (1) punishment under the law in terms of incarceration, suspension, monetary fines, service, etc. to the full extent, though there may be mitigating circumstances and (2) any instrument used in the commission of that crime, especially where it facilitated the crime's commission. Here is the difference: even if the vehicle had been financed or owned by another, it can be seized civilly.  If seized under a conviction, all that the offender has to give of it is fair game unless otherwise proscribed by law (state constitution, etc.) such that if the vehicle had been financed, a legal seizure could take place with the financing company claiming ownership in the vehicle and the state obtaining the equity value of the instrument/asset not owned by the finance company from the offender.  The state could later obtain the vehicle civilly, but the criminal aspect means that ownership is waived and not protected by a society's laws that are being violated through the criminal's act.  Consider whether the facts, if changed such that a state crime was committed with a weapon/firearm.  This would clearly be forfeited.   Now assume that the firearm was worth $40k plus.  It would not matter and thus should not matter here as the property's ownership transferred from the individual to the state once the laws of the state that protect the individual's property rights were violated with that property. It seems unlikely that a conservative court that respects stare decisis would be willing to legislate for states that have chosen to follow well established common law and not include limits to the contrary in their respective constitutions as many others have done.   ***Updating forecast to reflect comments of justices who appear comfortable to incorporate here for the purposes of civil forfeiture even though this case is of a criminal nature.***"], [1333, "2018-11-09T19:15:13Z", [0.5], ""]]}
