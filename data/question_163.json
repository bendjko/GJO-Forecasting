Taking the first error, I have now looked at every forthcoming primary (mainly based on the tools provided by 538 - http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/), and ended up consequently focusing solely on the races in Indiana and California, there aren't too many margin of error in the others.

I wouldn't argue if anyone said it was lower but I figured 1180-1210 is the right range. So going back to Indiana, because of its partial binary nature (wta 30 delegates) and its demographics, if it goes to Cruz, which I think it will, Trump may only get 9 votes which would mean he would need around 122 from California.

There is no reason to believe that his performance (or the performance of others) will have any impact on his decision to remain in the race. As it stands now, Kasich still has fewer delegates than Marco Rubio and even came in 4th place behind Rubio in the Arizona primary a week after Rubio suspended his campaign. Kasich has not won any delegates since this became a three-person race. Kasich has continued to underperform in recent primaries. Kasich has little money and organization and has no national campaign apparatus. There is no reason to believe that Kasich's decision to remain in the race or to suspend his campaign is in any way tied to his performance in any primary contest. He has no mathematical path to the nomination, he can only hope for a brokered/contested convention. Kasich foresees that a brokered/contested convention is likely and his control of a election-changing number of delegates will make him very powerful. He will be able to force either Trump or Cruz (more likely Trump) to make him their VP. He is also hoping there is a chance that the so-called \"establishment\" or Republican party insiders will completely bypass the will of the republican electorate and crown him the nominee, but that is also unlikely.  I think the most likely outcome is there will be a brokered/contested convention and Kasich will join forces with Trump (like he did in Michigan recently) and Trump/Kasich will be the Republican ticket. There are many unknowns, like the yet to be established convention rules, that could greatly impact the likelihood of this outcome, but I think Kasich sticking it out to the very end is almost a certainty.

Below is what I wrote for Ted Cruz, it also applies to Kascsh : \"My rationale is the following_ Ted Cruz will only drop out of the race if Trump gets the majority of delegates. So we have to analyze how likely Trump is getting the 1237 delegates he needs to at every stage of the bet. In order to help me with my analysis I go to 538's models  (http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/ ). Some notes on this model: - Until now it has been quite accurate in predicting the number of delegates for Donald Trump. \n- The model doesn't predict that Trump will get his majority before California. So my conclusions from the analysis of 538: a) Donald Trump will not get his 1237 delegates before California\nb) Even with the errors that may occur in the model it is very likely that Trump will get his delegates before the Convention.   So below follows my forecast: NY- 0%\nNEB- 0%\nCA- 0%\nCONV- 70%\nCONV+ 30% Conditions to change my forecast\n- Of course, by relying on 538's model I will have to check on how it performs. And review my forecasts accordingly. Further note: sice this forecast is radically oposed to consensus, I challenge everybody to question it. I think my reasoning makes sense and that 538's analysis is solid but would like to hear other opinions. I too was quite surprised that my reasoning led to this conclusions :) :) :)  \""], [12874, "2016-04-01T08:47:25Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.03, 0.22, 0.65], ""], [1544, "2016-04-01T08:20:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7], ""], [1544, "2016-04-01T08:20:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [4972, "2016-04-01T07:36:50Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.93], ""], [19912, "2016-04-01T05:40:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [241, "2016-04-01T04:03:38Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.05, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [241, "2016-04-01T03:59:53Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.01, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [102, "2016-04-01T02:06:40Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.08, 0.19, 0.63], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/gitrep-31mar16pm/"], [601, "2016-04-01T00:56:45Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.7], ""], [7445, "2016-04-01T00:47:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [22940, "2016-04-01T00:24:48Z", [0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.89], ""], [19170, "2016-03-31T21:10:59Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [18838, "2016-03-31T20:30:17Z", [0.01, 0.15, 0.06, 0.19, 0.59], ""], [368, "2016-03-31T19:54:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2016-03-31T17:27:02Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.03, 0.21, 0.67], ""], [484, "2016-03-31T16:10:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.95], "Moving 5% from 4th to 3rd bucket.

I've been thinking about it a lot lately. As of 3/29/16, many top operatives and Kasich himself believe that he has the best chance of Republicans in the general election. In order for Trump to win on the first ballot, he would need in excess of 55% of the remaining delegates, which is highly improbable given his rising unfavorable ratings in polls since the primaries began and his recent attacks on Cruz' wife.  If Trump does not win on the first ballot, the delegates are free to switch to another candidate. Top party operatives seem crystal-clear on this scenario as does Kasich.

Trump from capturing the presidential nomination increased the pressure Wednesday on Gov. John Kasich of Ohio to quit the race . . .  \"Mr. Kasich refused, saying that he, not the Texas senator, was the best option to stop Mr. Trump . . .\"Mr. Kasich ignored all calls to step down. He campaigned Wednesday in Wisconsin, where the next Republican primary will be held April 5, and his advisers argued that the race\u2019s final stretch of 20 states, mostly in the Northeast, Middle Atlantic and the West Coast, put Mr. Kasich in a far stronger position than Mr. Cruz to halt Mr. Trump.\n\u201cWhen we get to Pennsylvania, we get to New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island \u2014 let me tell you, I drop out, Donald Trump is absolutely going to be the nominee,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Senator Cruz can come to the East and win.\u201d \"Charlie Black, a strategic adviser for Mr. Kasich, echoed the theme, stressing that moderate Republicans dominate in most of the remaining states, not those who identify as \u201cvery conservative\u201d or evangelical, who have been Mr. Cruz\u2019s base of support.\n. . . \n\". . .  His strategy is to emerge as a white knight at the national convention, under the assumption that Mr. Trump will arrive in Cleveland lacking enough delegates for a first-ballot nomination.\n. . . \n\"Despite his huge deficiency, the Kasich campaign, citing national polls, argues that he would be the only Republican nominee with a chance of winning the White House in November. A poll this week by The New York Times and CBS News showed Mr. Trump losing a general election contest to Hillary Clinton by 10 points, with Mr. Cruz falling behind Mrs. Clinton by a narrower margin, but Mr. Kasich holding an advantage over her. \"Strategists for Mr. Kasich argue that having two challengers to Mr. Trump will deny him more delegates in more places, especially states where most delegates are allocated based on congressional districts. These include Wisconsin, New York and California, whose trove of 172 delegates is the largest of any state. \"That claim is \u201cempirically false,\u201d said Chris Wilson, a pollster for Mr. Cruz. \u201cThe fact is, Trump has a ceiling that is demonstrated election after election. All John Kasich does is split the anti-Trump vote, thereby handing Trump a plurality in each of these states.\u201d\n. . . \n\"All three candidates are looking to Wisconsin, where Mr. Kasich hopes to appeal in a Midwest industrial state similar to Ohio. An analysis of polling data by The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel recently showed Mr. Trump was highly unpopular in suburban counties near Milwaukee, which are some of the most favorable districts in the country for Republicans. But Wisconsin\u2019s governor, Scott Walker, has signaled that he favors Mr. Cruz.\n. . . \n\"A problem for Mr. Kasich in emerging as the nominee at a contested convention is that current rules require candidates to win a majority of delegates from eight states to be on the ballot in Cleveland. Although that can theoretically be relaxed by the rules committee, delegates loyal to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz on the committee, likely to be in the majority, could block changes favorable to Mr. Kasich. \"So desperate are some Republican leaders to stop Mr. Trump, believing he would lose the White House and threaten the party\u2019s grip on Congress, that they have urged Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich to coordinate efforts. The Ohio governor, say, might concentrate on districts in liberal Northern California, with the Texas senator focusing on more conservative Southern California.  But there is probably too much bad blood between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich for that kind of d\u00e9tente. Mr. Cruz was furious that Mr. Kasich campaigned in Utah. Mr. Kasich is angry at Mr. Cruz\u2019s continual refrain that he is a spoiler and should quit.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Kasich has been resisting pressure to drop out since almost the beginning.

I therefore estimate his chances of dropping out before NY as 40%. Next up comes NY, CT, DE, MD, PA, RI, IN. These states heavily favor Trump. Presuming Kasich is still in the race, he is likely to be left without winning many delegates in this section. I estimate his chances of dropping out at 40%. If he somehow manages to stay in the race until the Nebraska primary, I think it is likely he stays in until the convention.

PredictIt gives Kasich a 17% chance of being VP, so I'll say that he has a 15% chance of being Trump's VP, and distribute that among all of the possibilities except CONV+.\n- Kasich could leave because he realizes he can't win.  This is probably most likely after the New York or Pennsylvania primaries (in time period NEB-), so I'll that period an additional 25% chance.\n- Kasich could leave after Trump wins the majority of delegates.  This is most likely after the California primary, so I'll give CONV- the remainder of the probability weight.

He is betting on his appeal in the Mid-West.  Wisconsin is the only remaining  Mid-West state left in the race in a short time frame (Indiana and Nebraska are in May---too far out in my opinion).  If he does not win that one (he MUST win that one to be considered AT LEAST a small chance at the Convention as the alternative who can win the important Mid-West), he will lose all momentum (meaning money!) and the \"establishment\" will throw in the towel and go all-in for Cruz (not their preference, but...).  This pundit suggested that from \"his sources\" that Kasich will decide after Wisconsin to make a deal with Cruz or not. Take this all with a grain of salt, but Kasich IS a smart guy and if he can't win Wisconsin then even with his ambition I think he will see the writing on the wall. Seems to me \"Before New York\" should be in play more than it is (at a higher risk, though), \"After New York but before Nebraska\" out of play, and \"After Nebraska but before California\" should be more in play. However, if he loses Wisconsin and does not quit after Wisconsin, then he would stay in through \"Nebraska\" because that would include Indiana as well---Mid-West states.  He would not quit after New York because he will not do well there anyway. Bottom line: If he does not win Wisconsin, then he can write off Indiana and Nebraska too.  That is his whole strategy and he loses all moral claim to claim any legitimacy.  So, I think Wisconsin is more important than we may think it is. Kasich may want to be VP, but absolutely not for Trump. But I can see him consider to be Cruz's VP.   That is where the dealing may come in. Just my thoughts upon hearing this analysis.
