One thing it does do, however, is allow itself to be swayed to some degree by public sentiment. In 2019, there was an anti-China  wave among progressives and conservatives alike in light of the Hong Kong protests. When public opinion shifted toward Palestine in the US with the 2021 Israel-Palestine conflict, the Biden administration did show a sympathy toward Palestine uncharacteristic of American leadership.  There is momentum building for boycott: scores of human rights organizations have called for it and Biden has not ruled it out. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/12/olympics-china-boycott/) The only precedent for this drastic move is the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where the US boycotted at the height of the Cold War.(https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/carter-announces-olympic-boycott) It was nominally in response to USSR's invasion of Afghanistan, and was instigated by Jimmy Carter, a president who Biden has been compared to.   However, an important factor is the power of the Chinese market\u2014which has been shown to deter such entities as the NBA and Disney from causing any semblance of controversy with the country.

This will exert pressure on the White House in the debate over the Olympics.  I think a boycott is unlikely. But if there were some galvanizing event\u2014a Chinese action akin to the USSR invading Afghanistan or further escalation in Hong Kong or with the abuse of Uighurs\u2014public opinion could rise to a fury and push Biden into boycotting. This could create an increasingly rare scenario in which liberals and conservatives are united over a common enemy. Their voice would only need to drown out the impassioned lobbying of the Disneys and NBAs of the world desperate to maintain their global market.

Fighting against any \"genocide\" is a strong cause that could trigger a US boycott on Olympics. It is not for the 1st time US is raising this issue. In 2020, the US imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against several Chinese government officials, in response to the Uyghur genocide and human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Tibet. If more convergent statements at state level are coming in the next months the probability will increase. Any US Olympic committee decision should be based on something. In this case would be US official statements, and this makes a strong bond between US administration and Olympic committee. \nHistorically China doesn't engage in public debates about something considered \"internal affair\". But if US goes for a boycott is not only US-China trade at stake. EU and the Muslim world could adopt a similar stance. Historically, when engaging in an international action, US always looked for allies to take US side and give weight. Today, China\u2019s economic power depends on free trade and at global scale. The boycott on Olympics could be followed by international wide economic sanctions which pending on the duration could affect Xi Jinping 2025 announced development plans for China and challenge his authority. Even he is a president for life with dictatorial power, a long-term drawback in standards of living for common Chinese people is not something easy to go with. Also there is a risk that a new round of trade disputes will set US-China economic relations on a new base, and bilateral sanctions will become a norm. Therefore, there is a probability that China might accept an international commission investigation to alleviate the situation. This can gain time for China and go over the deadline for a go/ no go decision. On top, a positive turnaround can be politically used by Xi to pose in a victim of unfounded accusations and extend this on other hot issues like democracy in Hong Kong or Covid origin.

Inside Probability: The reason the US boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 was because of the Cold War.  Wikipedia describes the state of affair between the USSR and the US at the time: \"Carter responded to the Soviet intervention by withdrawing the SALT II treaty from ratification, imposing embargoes on grain and technology shipments to the USSR, and demanding a significant increase in military spending, and further announced that the United States would boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He described the Soviet incursion as the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War).  This all sounds fairly dire.  It's also worth looking at boycotts the US did NOT partake in to understand the things that US are more comfortable with (than other countries who boycotted).  This might gain insight into what the US might be willing to ignore.

That estimate puts me in the \"this COULD happen, but I have strong doubts\" category. Why the strong doubts? The decision-maker here is the USOPC (its official name), not the US government. Unlike most national Olympic committees, the USOPC gets virtually no direct funding from the US government. (https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usopc) Most of its funds come from sponsorship and licensing fees and its share of the IOC's television contract revenues and global sponsorship fees.

To me, the question of whether or not the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will be boycotted centres around Taiwan. Human rights alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to result in this historically unusual move. Given the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s atrocious human rights record, the calls to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will probably persist. So will the counter-arguments against politicization of sports. (It is said the boycott of the games in Moscow accomplished nothing but hurt the athletes.) The Olympics, however, are always more than just a sporting event (for instance, the Tokyo one later this year is presented as a symbol of hope, resilience, and recovery from COVID). A planned boycott by Western democracies would send a strong message, but the politicization argument will enable many to avoid drawing the lines between the collective West and the revisionist powers. Many in the collective West don\u2019t want to look confrontational, not the least for economic reasons.  However, should China invade Taiwan, the odds of a boycott would go up. An increasingly assertive China in what it considers its territory, the unfortunate precedent of Russia annexing Crimea with almost no meaningful negative consequences, and the ongoing military activity around Taiwan make such an invasion possible in the near(ish) future.  Another angle: The State Department has seemingly backed away from the idea of a boycott. But should we expect an announcement this early? Looking back at 1980, Carter announced the boycott in March 1980, just four months before the Olympics.  Chinese media\u2019s take on this: \u201cmeaningless Western boycott would only prove US weakness\u201d (SCMP).

If more and more agencies begin to call for a boycott, or athletes themselves declare that they will not participate (think along the lines of Mesut Ozil, formerly of Arsenal FC, who was, more or less, blackballed by calling out these atrocities in china), we might see USOC start to shift their position in wanting to be on the \"right side of history.\" It still appears to be a very small chance, but movement is starting and I am upping my forecast slightly, more in line with the crowd."], [57778, "2021-02-02T22:54:17Z", [0.35], ""], [27661, "2021-02-02T11:19:09Z", [0.11], ""], [11817, "2021-02-01T23:44:42Z", [0.03], ""], [62808, "2021-02-01T22:54:13Z", [0.15], ""], [1333, "2021-02-01T14:24:07Z", [0.3], ""], [96828, "2021-02-01T03:12:59Z", [0.15], ""], [57778, "2021-01-31T22:22:41Z", [0.35], ""], [57778, "2021-01-31T21:52:28Z", [0.42], ""], [96828, "2021-01-31T12:20:06Z", [0.2], ""], [57778, "2021-01-31T01:58:54Z", [0.45], ""], [97841, "2021-01-30T14:09:42Z", [0.03], "US population is incredibly focused on domestic, rather than international issues (in general and in particular at present).

US Boycotted 1 out of 3 (USSR 1980). And arguably, 1936  Germany was not \"yet\" on the enemy list. So essentially, US boycotted  50% of events historically. I'd say confrontation in 1980 was higher than with China now, and 2014  RU was lower. So let's dial it down to 30%. So if China  relations don't improve or deteriorate, I'd rank the chance at 30%. The current crowd forecast for Trump win in  US is 35%. Let's say the chance of boycott is 50% under Trump (because he will damage the relationship and China will do something in return, and US always sees this as an agression), and 20%  under Biden (there got to be reveral to \"normal\"). So it's 0.5*.35+0.2*.65 = 30.5% (rounding up to 31%). Let's discount a heat of election year a bit, I may be overweighting it all. So, I'd say 20% yes. PS:\nUPD: I missed one past China Olympic in 2008.  Hard to factor it in my original math, because Beijing was semi-rival at the time, almost not a rival. But the other thing is that the one time that US boycotted the Olympics, there was backlash from the athletes. And also if Olympic movement needs a recovery, post-COVID.

The announcement would be made on behalf of its Board of Directors, having 15 voting members.[4] Each individual vote is influenced by: a)\tThe USOPC\u2019s interests; Continued existence, revenue, renown.\nb)\tThe advertises interests; Association to the ideas of winning and good.\nc)\tThe Athletes\u2019 interest in competing.\nd)\tTheir personal value hierarchy in weighing these interests; Political views, own career perspectives. 3)\tWhen would it happen? If the USOPC\u2019s boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics became to be seen as having significant meaning to those interest groups, that can affect the USOPC\u2019s decision process and that choose to do so; Athletes, the US-Public, Sponsors, the US-Administration, and their respective stakeholders. a)\tAthletes dedicate their waking life to preparation. In 1980, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was not enough [5], even within the context of the Cold War. So the perception of the preceeding events would have to be substantial for athletes to make the individual or collective choice to boycott the games.\nb)\tThe US-Public does not have direct or indirect authority over the USOPC, but strongly felt general sentiment might have sway under (2a).\nc)\tSponsors wish to be associated with the concept of winning in the abstract. If advertisement at the 2022 Winter Games would mean to choose between markets (b/c being seen either as pro Western value hierarchy, or pro Chinese value hierarchy), they might pressure to boycott, so they would avoid this choice. Or supply without advertisement. [6] Or the opposite: They might embrace that possibility to associate themselves with a value hierarchy. [7]\nd)\tThe US-Administration does not have direct authority over the USOPC [7], but could still hinder the USOPC\u2019s attendance through political means, like travel restrictions. Reasons for this might either be an ad hoc decision, more likey under Trump 2, or stem from an express strategy, more likely under Biden 1. As of now, there seems to be no express public strategy by the receding dominant power in the US-China Thucydides's Trap, like the Cold War was against the Soviet Union. With the power dynamics being continually at play, as noted in examples by @chiefthe, for both options I increase the initial 3,8% odds slightly to 4,8%, giving 5% as current (09/03/20) answer.

I expect there's an 80% probability that Biden (or Harris) is the president, 20% that it's Trump (or Pence).\nIt seems nearly certain that there will be a significant movement pressuring countries to boycott the games, given that there are already calls being made and the general climate of anti-racism and pro civil rights activism.\nUnder a Biden administration, I expect that pressure to have a significant likelihood of being effective, especially if some high profile US athletes opt not to go individually. I'll estimate that at 40%.\nA Trump presidency could go one of two ways. In general, he appreciates spectacle and displays of nationalism, which suggests he'd strongly prefer the US to compete. Conversely, he has a mostly antagonistic relationship with the Chinese government.
