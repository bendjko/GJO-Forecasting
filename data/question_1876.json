It's hard to judge technology readiness 5 months away, and Diem does probably have *something*\nb. They have at several points announced that they will launch this year.\nc. The fixed costs are probably fairly large, driving FB to launch Diem *eventually*\nd. There is already an open source project building on top of Diem/aiming to bridge Diem with normal crypto, the Pontem network: https://twitter.com/pontemnetwork?lang=en. They seem to be fairly active\ne. Novi, a wallet for Diem, already exists. https://www.novi.com/news.  So my overall impression is that, sure, I could be reading the tea leaves wrongly, but most of the time in situations like this I'd expect there to be a delay. More generally, by looking at their Github I get the strong hunch that this will not launch in the ~next month, but I'm much less sure whether they will be ready by Christmas, *and I expect Diem developers to be in the same position*, hence the 2021 announcement."], [60948, "2021-08-12T10:41:10Z", [0.3], ""], [60948, "2021-08-10T17:21:24Z", [0.22], ""], [1333, "2021-08-09T09:57:37Z", [0.1], ""], [62808, "2021-08-08T15:55:11Z", [0.5], ""], [96757, "2021-08-08T12:47:41Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2021-08-06T17:29:42Z", [0.3], ""], [1333, "2021-08-06T14:25:28Z", [0.11], ""], [59881, "2021-08-05T15:52:15Z", [1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-08-05T05:41:57Z", [0.32], ""], [102150, "2021-08-04T14:06:06Z", [0.6], ""], [60948, "2021-08-04T14:03:57Z", [0.25], ""], [90167, "2021-07-31T23:22:20Z", [0.29], ""], [86367, "2021-07-31T11:22:00Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-07-30T00:59:39Z", [0.1], ""], [60948, "2021-07-28T22:14:50Z", [0.32], "Paper by someone associated with Diem: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3893937.
