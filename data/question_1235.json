Wind speed on Nov. 17th.\n\"Hurricane Lenny was the fifth category-four hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) of the 1999 season - a record. This hurricane had a major impact on numerous land areas in the Caribbean Sea. Moreover, Lenny was the first storm to have an extended west-to-east track across the central and eastern Caribbean Sea in the 113-year Atlantic tropical cyclone record.\" Michelle (2001): Low pressure ID'd on Oct. 16th, max wind speed on Nov. 4th:\n\"The origin of Michelle was a tropical wave that moved westward across the coast of Africa on 16 October. The wave showed few signs of development while it crossed the Atlantic to the Lesser Antilles by 23 October. Associated shower activity increased on 26 October when the wave reached the western Caribbean, and a broad low pressure area formed near the coast of Nicaragua the next day.\n...\n\"Michelle turned slowly north-northeastward after 1200 UTC the 3rd while some fluctuations in intensity occurred. It reached a peak intensity of 120 kt from 0600-1800 UTC on the 4th while accelerating northeastward. This motion brought the center of Michelle to the southwestern offshore islands of Cuba near 1800 UTC that day as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, and to the Cuban mainland near the Bay of Pigs about 5 hours later.\" Paloma (2008): Low pressure ID'd on Nov. 1st, Max wind speed on Nov. 8th:\n\"Paloma originated from a broad area of disturbed weather that developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on 1 November. Convection in this region was intermittent for a couple of days but became more persistent on 4 November, and Dvorak classifications were initiated on the disturbance at 0000 UTC that day.\n...\n\"Paloma began to rapidly intensify late on 7 November and became a major hurricane around 0000 UTC 8 November....  This increase in divergence aloft occurred ahead of an approaching upper-level trough digging into the Gulf of Mexico, which also appears responsible for enhancing the outflow on the northwestern periphery of the cyclone early on 8 November. Paloma reached its peak intensity of 125 kt (category 4) around 1200 UTC that day as it turned toward the northeast (Fig. 4). During the 24-h period ending at 1200 UTC 8 November, Paloma\u2019s intensity increased by 50 kt. At its peak intensity, Paloma became the second strongest November Atlantic hurricane on record; only Hurricane Lenny (1999) was stronger (135 kt)2. Paloma was a category 4 hurricane when the cyclone\u2019s eye passed just to the southeast of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, with the northwestern eyewall passing over the eastern end of Cayman Brac.\""], [78328, "2019-10-30T21:36:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [78328, "2019-10-30T21:35:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [68294, "2019-10-30T16:19:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.96, 0.04, 0.0], "So far only Dorian and Lorenzo qualify as >= Cat 4 Hurricanes.

That works out to roughly 1 late-season hurricane every 8-10 years, or 10-15% chance. Also it appears that the frequency of these storms has increased strongly in recent years: 4-5 hurricanes have averaged about 1 every 4-5 years from 1920 - 2010 (at least based on storms that were detected; presumably some where not in those early years); versus an average of 1-1.5 per year in the last 5 years. So perhaps we should multiply our odds by about 4? Of the 5 conditions necessary for hurricane formation, it appears that all are currently in place particularly in the Caribbean and gulf.  So by this analysis I would predict a much higher probability than I have in the my earlier estimates. Maybe it should be more like 15-50% probability range.

For 2019, NOAA predicts a likely range of 9 to 15 named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), of which 4 to 8 could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 2 to 4 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).  NOAA provides these ranges with a 70% confidence. An average hurricane season produces 12 named storms, of which 6 become hurricanes, including 3 major hurricanes. https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-predicts-near-normal-2019-atlantic-hurricane-season"], [55516, "2019-07-29T19:20:18Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.06, 0.88], "Most hurricanes never make landfall, so they go unnoted."], [77466, "2019-07-29T16:48:20Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05], "https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastint.shtml"], [77465, "2019-07-29T14:42:46Z", [0.17, 0.2, 0.42, 0.13, 0.08], ""], [1019, "2019-07-29T13:46:35Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.44, 0.44, 0.02], ""], [56863, "2019-07-29T11:41:45Z", [0.11, 0.51, 0.18, 0.07, 0.13], ""], [29969, "2019-07-28T18:27:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.69, 0.27], ""], [29057, "2019-07-28T17:39:16Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.5, 0.4, 0.01], ""], [35054, "2019-07-28T17:16:33Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.2, 0.35, 0.35], ""], [32438, "2019-07-28T11:59:59Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [77452, "2019-07-28T10:16:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.55, 0.25], ""], [77445, "2019-07-28T02:06:13Z", [0.07, 0.08, 0.3, 0.4, 0.15], ""], [77439, "2019-07-27T18:02:58Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.45, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [77436, "2019-07-27T13:53:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25], "Total guess but I don't think we have many we have many years when we have none.

This is an average of 1.625 such hurricanes per year.  Some years there were no major hurricanes (83, 86, 87, 90, 93, 94, 97, 06, 12, 13) whilst in others there were 4 or more (99, 04, 05, 10, 17), or 3 (88, 95, 08) .  From this it would appear that the greatest probability would be 1 or 2 hurricanes.\n\nLooking in more detail, hurricanes seem to be dependent upon (i) the ocean surface temperature (if it is over approx 26.5 degrees Celsius then hurricanes can more easily form and there is a correlation between increased surface temp and increased storm intensity) and (ii)  the shearing winds over the ocean which will hinder hurricane formation if they are strong.  The shearing winds appear to be related to the El Nino effect, such that in significant El Nino years there are increased shearing winds over the Atlantic and fewer hurricanes develop.  Over the last 40 years, El Nino effects were significant in 80, 83, 86, 87, 91, 93, 94, 97, 02, 04, 06, 09, 14, 15 and 19.  They apparently are cyclical, with effects lasting for around 6-18 months and occurring every 2-5 years on average.  There is a very noticeable correlation between the El Nino years and the years in which there were none or only one major hurricane (cat 4 or above).  This would seem to suggest that in an El Nino year, there is more chance of none or only one major hurricane.   The ocean temperature appears to be also cyclical, but over longer periods and I haven't yet considered this in detail.  At present, we seem to be in a \"warmer phase\" and the ocean temperature in the Atlantic east of the Caribbean seems to be just over 27 Celsius, so hurricanes are possible but as I see it are likely to be offset by El Nino.

NOAA's climate prediction service thinks there is a 40% chance it will be an average year, and 30% each on being above or below average - but these figures deal with the season as a whole rather than severe storms.  Crowd forecast with 12 forecasters is 0 = 7%, 1 = 8%, 2= 31%, 3 = 23%, and 4+ = 31%, which is probably a function of whether they decide to more heavily weight the average or whether they think global warming, El Nino, etc. is going to drive more storm activity. Ironically, El Nino actually reduces the number of storms in the Atlantic.[2]  Edit: Looked over the years and it's like 70% chance that it will be 0 and 30% chance it will be one major storm in a year with a moderate to strong El Nino.  Interesting tidbit from the article: \"In early April, the Tropical Meteorology Project at CSU's Department of Atmospheric Sciences predicted 13 named storms and five hurricanes, two of which would strengthen into major hurricanes. That's a slightly less active season than typically seen from 1981-2010.\" Update in June raised probabilities to a typical season with 2 major Category 3+ storms.
