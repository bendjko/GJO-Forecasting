This is a very tough question, which is why I decided to try it.   The governor is very unpopular.  The challenger is more popular.  In the most recent debate, the Republican governor dropped his anti-Trump impeachment attacks on his Democratic challenger.   I doubt he would have done that unless his internal polls said the issue was not helping him.   The summary of the most recent debate suggests that Beshear has a more appealing economic message and Bevin might be  stronger on  Kentucky social issues.   Bevin has closed an 8-point gap in the last few weeks so the trend is in his direction, and he recently pumped in another $900k of his own money into his  campaign.
