On the website of EWP they state that the Taliban already engages in a \"mass killing episode\" against \"non-combatant civilians suspected of supporting Afghan government or NATO Coalition Forces\" since 2001 [1]. In their own risk assessment of Afghanistan, they state that this only \"relates to the possibility of a new and distinct non-state-led or state-led episode beginning, not to the likelihood of Taliban attacks continuing or increasing.\" [2] From the phrasing here on GJP it's not clear at all whether this only refers to such new episode and not the Taliban one. However, I will assume that it does indeed refer to new episodes, and not a continuation of the Taliban one. Base rate: not clear at all how one would calculate this here. EWP only has \"ongoing mass killings\", but not a list of all recorded ones as far as I could find. Eye-balling this gives about 0-3 new such mass killings per year. Let's assume 1 on average for now. Let's say there are about 30 to 50 countries which are reasonably at risk of such an episode (including Afghanistan). That gives 2-3% as a base rate. This fits kind of well with the global average of 2.6% that EWP gives. (I'm somewhat surprised by this high number though as a **global** average.) A wider distribution would give a reasonable interval between 1% (1 out of 100) to 10% (3 out of 30). This seems about right. Other judgments:\n- EWP itself gives a probability of 24.1% [3]\n- CFR lists Afghanistan as a \"Top Conflict to Watch in 2019\" [4]\n- crowd forecast here is 2% Insight view:\n- If we assume that the Taliban do not count, other plausible perpetrators are: (1) military forces of Afghanistan, (2) Islamic State, (3) other\n- (1) seems extremely unlikely. While governance is bad, I think there is only an extremely low chance that the government would **deliberately** target civilians,  <1%.\n- (2) seems plausible: In 2018, \"UNAMA attributed 2,181 civilian casualties (681 deaths and 1,500 injured) to Daesh/ISKP, an increase of 118 per cent compared to 2017, comprising 20 per cent of all civilian casualties.\" [5] If this trend holds, this would constitute another instance of mass killing resolving the question positively. In fact, the increase would only need to be ~50%, not 118%. However, violence seems to have decreased over the previous months. They also seem to have suffered some setbacks last year. They are still operational though with about 2,000 fighters [6], and continue to target civilians. [7][8] They are not part of the peace talks as far as I can tell. \n- (3) seems less likely. It's unclear which actors this would be. While \"UNAMA attributed 678 civilian casualties (196 deaths and 482 injured) to undetermined Anti-Government Elements\" [5], this does not constitute a campaign. I estimate about 1%, maybe 2% at worst.  Overall judgment:\n- The crowd forecast of 2% seems far too low, both given the base rate, EWP judgment, and insight view.\n- I'm not sure how to reason well about this to be honest. There are between 20,000 to 40,000 Taliban fighters [9], compared to only 2,000 Daesh fighters. Naively, they should never be able to reach the Taliban numbers in terms of civilian deaths, but they were already at about 50% last year, far beyond the expected 5-10%. So this doesn't tell us much.\n- I will just go with my updated gut judgment which is 32%.
