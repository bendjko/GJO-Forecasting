That translated to $54M, $33M and $22M wide (same source, but movie).  There are some projections already for the weekend [2] in the region of $30M, maybe $25M, which for the week would be closer to the last two movies (range $33M - $22M), but both of them in December. Maybe this is a factor to consider. About the movie, it got 92% in the Tomatometer [3], not a guarantee of anything with audience, but a good reference, with DiCaprio and Pitt as attraction. Just to compare, the previous three movies got 88%, 86% and 72% [4]. It got 9.6/10 in IMDb (8.3, 8.4 and 7.8). Critics are expressly mentioning that they would not reveal the end, another indicator, and while not the typical Tarantino's movie, it seems it gets close to a masterpiece (not being one). So, saving 1% and 5% for <$20M and >$60M, 30% up to $40M and 64% more than $40M.
