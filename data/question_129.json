While the data reported 585 fatalities in its \"violence against civilians\" category for the 12 months running up to August 26, it now reports 688 fatalities for the same time period. This is likely due to the way ACLED handles its input data (and the delayed availability of that data) and I will anticipate this behavior in future analyses.\n- As of today, 804 people have been killed in the last 12 months in \"violence against civilians\" events, already more than my initial estimate. I will assume that the actual number is even higher because of ACLED \"backloading\"\n-  The patterns of violence that I talked about in my last comment (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/311161) seem to have changed. While killings were concentrated around individual large scale protest events for the better part of the year, since the last wave of protests civilians have continued to suffer at a pretty consistent pace. The last 30 days saw 120 civilian deaths, dispersed over several distinct events, pointing to an escalation of the violence perpetrated by government forces.\n- Perhaps the reason for the escalating violence, protest events seem to spread across more (and smaller) towns within the country.  Based on this new data, I am pretty certain that ACLED will see more than 1,000 deaths at the end of the year. The challenge is of course that the question doesn't ask for a forecast on ACLED data, but is based on the EWP's definition of \"mass killing\", which has additional requirements pertaining to the nature of the victims. It would be great to have a representative of the EWP comment on how they see the current situation in Ethiopia and if all or the majority of the civilian deaths so far fit into their definition or not. Until then, this question presents the most important source of uncertainty, not actual developments on the ground. I will nonetheless increase my forecast considerably. At this time I assume that about 750 people have been killed since January 1 under circumstances consistent with EWP's definition. Given that the Ethiopian government has so far not reacted in any material way to the protesters' demands and grievances, I will assume that current levels of violence will at least continue, if not become worse. This puts my revised estimate at 60%.

Practically all of these fatalities occured after 31 December 2015, so they won't \"expire\" before the question runs out. Projecting the current rate would leave fatalities short of 1,000, but not considerably. Assuming current levels of violence, I estimate that 2016 will see around 800 total civilian deaths at the hands of security forces. Note that this report by Amnesty International (https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/ethiopia-dozens-killed-as-police-use-excessive-force-against-peaceful-protesters/) seems to be already reflected in the data. Looking at the patterns of violence against civilians reflected in the ACLED data, it seems like the vast majority of killings happen in the wake of mass protests that are suppressed violently by security forces. Since the beginning of 2016 I count three of these extremely violent episodes, with fatalities reaching from about 100 to more than 200 for each of them. I make the assumption that the basic dynamic of this violence won't change (e.g. the Ethiopian government won't start going from door to door killing opposition members, but will continue to meet any form of protest with extreme violence). We should expect one or two more weekends of mass demonstrations which will result in an average of 150 civilian fatalities if the trend holds, leaving the total well below the 1,000 mark. That would put the probability of the question resolving with \"yes\" at well below 50%, I would argue at about 10%. There are reports (http://qz.com/757824/how-the-ethiopia-protests-were-stifled-by-a-coordinated-internet-shutdown/) that the Ethiopian government has for the first time shut down online access during the last protests. Assuming these tactics are continued and handled professionally, it would reduce the capacity of protesters to organize, thus limit protests and fatalities. On this assumption I subtract 5% off my forecast. But the geographic reach of the protests are spreading, with some of the most significant demonstrations of the last wake taking place in Amhara region. This puts the ruling elite under considerable pressure (http://www.africa-confidential.com/article/id/11754/The_centre_holds_on) and increases the potential for large-scale demonstrations and corresponding violence, which inclines me to add 10% to my initial forecast, bringing the final tally to 15%. What I will be looking for in the future:\n* Will the current dynamics of violence hold?\n* How many large-scale demonstrations are we seeing/anticipating?\n* Are other sections of society joining the protesters?\n* The capital itself didn't see large demonstrations or much bloodshed so far. It is the largest city of the country and if it experiences a sizable demonstration with corresponding violence, it will likely push the number of fatalities up considerably."], [19801, "2016-08-26T03:47:40Z", [0.25], "Up on Shiva's link.

A narrow interpretation is that whatever government (\u201cin\u201d tribe) forces there are target only a specific subset of the population. Then there is a broader interpretation that any significant deaths that are not combat related or otherwise proscribed would count (in the sense that those targeted are \u201coutsiders\u201d in some sense).

This rank does not account for the terror originating from Ethiopia but merely terror on the country.   Regarding the impact of terror,  the country has a ranking of 50 out of 124 with a scaled value of 3.54 / 10.0 .  Al Shabaab has been primarily responsible for these deaths along with domestic and international externalities with 1,021 deaths for 2014.  With the number of attacks increasing by one and a half times to nearly 500. If this rate increases exponentially (given that terror networks always seek new and better targets with none or little counter terror activity planned or executed by the ruling government.  If the rate of attacks continue on par with 2015, we can expect it to surpass the empirical requirement of 1000 deaths in 1 year, cummulatively.  With attacks in shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, including in February 2015. Although al-Shabaab has attracted members from the United Kingdom and the United States, they have not conducted attacks in countries outside of East Africa, externalities continue to arise with every successful terror operation. Private citizens are the target of 36 per cent of attacks, with an average of 2.5 deaths per attack. The military is also a major target of al-Shabaab, accounting for 237 deaths over 55 attacks. The biggest attack by al-Shabaab was against the paramilitary group Raskamboni Movement and the military forces of\nJubaland which killed 91 people. Al-Shabaab also had 70 separate kidnapping or hostage attacks which resulted in 238 deaths.   The share of world refugee population by country of refuge in 2014 was 5% of the global total.   This measure is a good indicator of the the relative extent, intensity of political instability.   Political instability in this case is not intended to exclude economic, infrastructural or military fractionalization.  All these factors provide non causal by interconnected event outcomes that leads us to potentially 'see' the movement to the mass killing ceiling. Additional note:  The intensity of terror and the rebellion in Ethiopia, like other states, indicates where the state will place its resources,  Since rebel and terror movement hide members of their cells among urban centers and rural populations, this also provides and indication of what counter-terror directions a state would take.   An additional indicator, particularly in Africa is the degree of social cohesion in societies that are heavily fragmented along lines of ethnicity (ie., ethnic backgrounds and affiliation).

A more recent source (2) suggests that the dispute doesn't seem to have settled. So if we use a base rate of 90 people killed per month, we get 1080 people killed over the course of 2016, which would just about qualify as a mass killing.

I think it'll get worse for the following reasons: >Usually, when the government fires on protesters, things get worse. Off the top of my head I can think of four times when violent intervention worsened the situation (Ukraine, Tunisia, Syria, Libya), and one time when it was effective (China 1989). (Of course, 'off of the top of my head' is not a great sampling technique, so if anyone can offer some better examples, let me know). Three of those samples (Tunisia, Syria, Libya) were closely related and shouldn't be considered independent - let's call them 2 samples instead of three. It vaguely follows that 75% of the time, violent government intervention leads to a worsening situation (I will also add that in all of those samples except Tunisia, more than 1000 people were killed). I'll bump that 75% down to 50% because sampling bias - I'm more likely to remember protests that escalated into wars than those that didn't. So we'll start with a rate of 50% >Thus far, the violent intervention has not succeeded in stopping the unrest. The best predictor of future performance is past performance. If killing >140 people doesn't stop it quickly, it's probably not going to stop it slowly. Bump up 15%. >The issue underlying the unrest is deep seated and largely intractable. I imagine it is like a powder keg ready to explode: They have a distinct ethnic identity, and their economic and political marginalization will not be fixed within the year. I.e, this issue won't just \"blow over\" as people get bored of it. It is probably here to stay. Bump up 7%. I can't think of any obvious reasons that the situation will get better rather than worse.

The project that was causing so much harm has been canceled and violence may subside (this project has been the source of most of the violence in the past 5 years).  http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/02/08/road-linking-kenya-to-ethiopia-to-be-completed-in-six-months_c1291414\nIn more good news, a major new road (through Oromo territory) is nearing completion. \nRoads, in Africa, bring better living conditions and the Oromo will likely benefit from this.
