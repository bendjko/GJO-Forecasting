Paul LePage (R) . . . released a statement saying, \" . . . . my administration will not implement Medicaid expansion until it has been fully funded by the Legislature at the levels DHHS [Department of Health and Human Services] has calculated, and I will not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.\u201d The statement by LePage indicates that the implementation of Question 2 could conflict over how to fund the state's portion of the costs of Medicaid expansion and resulting delays in implementation. The Maine Office of Fiscal and Program Review estimated that the state's portion of the cost would be about $54.5 million per year, while LePage estimated the cost at closer to $100 million. Normally, initiatives go into effect 30 days after the official proclamation of election results. If the initiative requires spending beyond available state funds, however, and does not provide a funding mechanism, the effective date of the initiative can be delayed until 45 days into the following legislative session. Question 2 was written to give the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 90 days after its effective date to submit a plan to the federal government and 180 days to begin expanded coverage\" \n~~~~~~~ \nCOMMENT:  Given all of the above, and the closing date of Nov 30 on this question, if I was an Admin, I'd be leaning towards saying that ME doesn't satisfy the question because even in the best case scenario--no funding issues or objection from the Governor--it would be 30 days from 11/7 before it went into effect.
