First, my own biases: (1) I'm a tax editor, so I HOPE we get tax reform because it will sell a lot of books. (2) I think Trump is an incompetent racist who never really thought he would be President, but here we are. However, he's only one of the moving parts in the tax reform machine. So the shortcomings that I have identified are only partially relevant to my analysis.  So me and my other editors, along with our gaggle of authors (lawyers, accountants, financial planners, and other people that Jimmy Buffet warned us about) have been keeping an eye on the possibility of tax reform, including a repeal of the estate tax, ever since Trump got elected. According to all concerned, The right timeline for doing tax reform was to introduce a bill (maybe more than one) in April or May, kick it around for the summer, do the hard work in the fall, and get it passed sometime in October. For many reasons that didn't happen. So then the plan became to gather at the Reagan ranch and write a bill in August to be introduced after Labor Day. That hasn't happened. Given Hurricane Harvey some delay was understandable, but now we're hearing that a bill will be introduced Sept. 25 (http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/14/trump-tax-reform-big-six-242719), though it seems like they're struggling to even meet that deadline. So, questions: (1) Assuming a bill (and not just a statement of policy positions, but an actual here's-how-we're-changing-the-code bill) gets filed (not just waived around) by Sept. 25-ish, could they pass tax reform? Yes, if they are willing to step on some toes (and they are). It will likely require the rest of the year, and the process of implementing it will make heads explode at the IRS, but it could get done. (2) Will tax reform include a repeal of the estate tax? Yes. First, repealing the estate tax has been an absolute darling of the Republican party for a long time. In fact, they actually did repeal it for one year (2010), and nothing bad happened. This is because next to nobody pays the estate tax. Currently you have to have an estate north of $5 million to even worry about it ($10 million if you're married), and anyone with that kind of money has hired a good estate planner. This means that repealing the estate tax is something the dems are happy to give to the Rs in exchange for something else, and it also means that it won't add too much to the deficit. The hard part about doing tax reform is doing it in a way that gets anything even remotely close to a reasonable score from the CBO. Repealing a tax that all Rs hate and that adds very little revenue? Easy call. (3) So, will they? If Trump was even marginally competent at negotiating Washington's corridors of power, I would put this at 60+%, even at this late date. Politically, this is a must-win, do it for the Gipper (literally), failure-is-not-an-option issue for the Rs. There is enough complexity in tax reform that you can put enough sweeteners in to get some D votes, and this gets a whole lot harder to do in 2018. Think of it this way: If you do it 2017, you can debate until just before Christmas, pass some back-room compromise, and let the IRS sort it out over the next 12 months. But if you push it until 2018, you have an election in early November, and primaries in the spring. So not only do you have two fewer months of debate, any R who goes into primary without having passed tax reform (or anything else of substance, for that matter), is in real trouble from the Bannon Brigade of potential hard-right challengers. And if you end up with too many hard-right mouth breathers running for office, some seats that used to be safe for Rs won't be. Rs absolutely need tax reform for their own political survival. So let's pick some numbers.  If John Kasich was President, I'd go with 75%. With Trump, I'll start at 40% and add the following modifiers:\n-Trump is  apparently willing to work with Dems on certain things. If it was earlier in the year, I'd give this +15%, but getting anything through the House that Ds support is tough and adds a lot of delay, so I'll go with +10%.\n-Hard-left dems are really mobilized against anything Trump does, and he still hasn't released his tax returns (which is particularly relevant to this debate). -5%\n-More bad things can happen (hurricanes, indictments, DPRK nukes Guam, etc.) and tax reform needs some stability -5% So I'll stick with 40% for now. However, if we get past September and we're still screwing around without any hard proposals, it will probably go way down."], [368, "2017-09-14T20:33:25Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T20:25:38Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-14T20:25:12Z", [0.0], ""], [30610, "2017-09-14T15:35:08Z", [0.0], ""], [1993, "2017-09-14T05:49:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T02:11:00Z", [0.01], ""], [1529, "2017-09-14T00:44:49Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-13T20:30:27Z", [0.0], ""], [38940, "2017-09-13T08:32:41Z", [0.11], ""], [691, "2017-09-13T01:18:22Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-12T17:39:33Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2017-09-12T02:23:32Z", [0.0], ""], [38930, "2017-09-12T00:59:22Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-09-11T20:16:10Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-10T19:47:32Z", [0.0], ""], [38840, "2017-09-10T17:17:45Z", [0.01], "There is too little time left in the year to get even a first round of tax reform done, especially now that Trump and the Democrats agreed to revisit the debt ceiling in December, and immigration has taken center stage for at least the next month or two.

However, the antagonistic, Freedom Caucus-ish bill is likely to deepen the divide within the GOP between conservatives and moderates. Additionally, increases to the defense caps outlined under the 2011 Budget Control Act requires a bipartisan budget agreement, meaning the GOP would need 8 Senate D's to support these cuts, which is unlikely.  (For clarification, a budget resolution, which this article talks about, is essentially an agreement between House and Senate on overall discretionary spending levels, and is what sets the rules for using reconciliation. A bipartisan budget agreement to relieve pressure from the 2011 BCA caps is usually a 2-yr deal to allow discretionary spending in defense and non-defense to exceed the sequestration levels set forth in the 2011 BCA. Failure to come to agreement would result in sequestration taking effect, with cuts to both defense and non-defense. The non-defense cuts would be spread across the 11 appropriations that comprise non-defense expenditures, where the defense cuts would be spread across DOD. -- Fun fact: the 2011 BCA was created as a forcing mechanism to address the ballooning costs of mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid - the very things that will cause the FY18 budget negotiations to possibly devolve into a government shutdown!) It seems unlikely that such efforts will go anywhere, especially since Sen D's can use their leverage to either enact sequestration or to shut down the government, both of which would look bad for a GOP-controlled WH and Congress (it'll also look bad for the Dems, but Ted Cruz's stunt in 2013 demonstrated the party out of power will suffer less than the party in power).

While Paul Ryan is optimistic about passing legislation before the end of the calendar year, Mitch McConnell has indicated he hopes to have it passed by the end of this Congress, which is December 2018 (http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/24/paul-ryan-wants-to-put-tax-reform-on-trumps-desk-by-christmas.html). But as Forbes reports (https://www.forbes.com/sites/stancollender/2017/05/23/trump-2018-budget-puts-tax-reform-in-jeopardy/#794b9034e29b), the FY18 President's Budget Request essentially sets up a showdown this fall, either between R's and D's over the budget, or between Congress and the White House over different budgets. All of this makes it less likely any meaningful tax reform will be accomplished, no matter how seemingly appealing it would be to wealthy Republicans. Also, reconciliation is a complex process that takes a significant amount of time. And while it may seem like it should be easy to achieve, the reconciliation process, especially in the Senate, gives a lot of power to the committee chairs, who can then pursue changes not originally intended by leadership (the House has more control through the Rules committee and House leadership). But at the end of the day, any reconciliation legislation must go through the Senate's \"Byrd bath\" (real term they use) before it can be approved. This significantly reduces the likelihood of accomplishing this in the first 3 months of FY18, especially if Congress passes a CR to keep the government open in October, as the CR would likely expire Friday, December 8th, requiring Congress to either pass a budget or negotiate a new CR. From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_(United_States_Congress)): Process To trigger the reconciliation process, Congress passes a concurrent resolution on the budget instructing one or more committees to report changes in law affecting the budget by a certain date. If the budget instructs more than one committee, then those committees send their recommendations to the Budget Committee of their House, and the Budget Committee packages the recommendations into a single omnibus bill. In the Senate, the reconciliation bill then gets only 20 hours of debate and amendments are limited. Only one reconciliation bill can be passed in any given year.[4] A reconciliation bill is a bill containing changes in law recommended pursuant to reconciliation instructions in a budget resolution. If the instructions pertain to only one committee in a chamber, that committee reports the reconciliation bill. If the instructions pertain to more than one committee, the House Budget Committee reports an omnibus reconciliation bill, but it may not make substantive changes in the recommendations of the other committees.[21] Former Senator Judd Gregg explained the complex sequence of steps involved in reconciliation. He emphasizes the complexity of the process, especially if there is a deep partisan divide:[22]     Congress passes a budget resolution, with a deadline of April 15. No presidential signature is needed; sometimes the resolution is delayed or never passed.\n    The budget goes to both houses.\n    It goes to the Senate with a special rule: it can pass with 51 votes and cannot be filibustered. Other legislation can be filibustered and requires 60 votes to end the filibuster.\n    The budget cannot affect entitlements such as Medicare unless the budget includes \"reconciliation instructions.\" In that case, the Byrd rule applies and the primary result must be to reduce entitlement spending. Gregg notes, \"If the budget calls for more revenue to reduce the deficit, then reconciliation can be used to produce that revenue via fees or taxes.\" A reconciliation instruction is a provision in a budget resolution directing one or more committees to submit legislation changing existing law in order to bring spending, tax revenues, or the debt ceiling into conformity with the budget resolution. The instructions specify the committees to which they apply, indicate the appropriate dollar changes to be achieved, and usually provide a deadline by which the legislation is to be reported or submitted.[23]\n    After the changes are made, the Budget Committees consolidate them into one bill that is voted on by both houses; it needs 51 Senate votes.\n    The final reconciliation covers government spending and goes to the president who can sign it or veto it; the veto can be overturned by a two-thirds majority in both houses. Byrd Rule\nFurther information: Sunset provision \u00a7 Budget Act and the Byrd Rule\nThe Byrd Rule defines any reconciliation changes to Social Security as \"extraneous\"\u2014and therefore ineligible for reconciliation. The Byrd Rule is a United States Senate rule that amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to allow Senators during the Reconciliation Process to block legislation if it possibly would increase significantly the federal deficit beyond a ten-year term or is otherwise an \"extraneous matter\" as set forth in the Budget Act.[24] It is named after West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd. Reconciliation generally involves legislation that changes the budget deficit (or conceivably, the surplus). The \"Byrd Rule\" (2 U.S.C. \u00a7 644, named after Democratic Senator Robert Byrd) was adopted in 1985 and amended in 1990 to outline for which provisions reconciliation can and cannot be used. The Byrd Rule defines a provision to be \"extraneous\"\u2014and therefore ineligible for reconciliation\u2014in six cases:     If it does not produce a change in outlays or revenues;\n    If it produces an outlay increase or revenue decrease when the instructed committee is not in compliance with its instructions;\n    If it is outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure;\n    If it produces a change in outlays or revenues which is merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision;\n    If it would increase the deficit for a fiscal year beyond those covered by the reconciliation measure; or\n    If it recommends changes in Social Security. Any senator may raise a procedural objection to a provision believed to be extraneous, which will then be ruled on by the Presiding Officer, customarily on the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian. A vote of 60 senators is required to overturn the ruling. The Presiding Officer need not necessarily follow the advice of the Parliamentarian, and the Parliamentarian can be replaced by the Senate Majority Leader.[25] The Vice President as President of the Senate can overrule the parliamentarian, but this has not been done since 1975.[26] In 2001, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fired Parliamentarian Robert Dove after dissatisfaction with his rulings, replacing him with Alan Frumin.[27]"], [1643, "2017-05-25T04:09:16Z", [0.15], "Decreasing probability because:\n1) Health care bill still delayed.

After the start of FY18, there's 9 legislative weeks.
