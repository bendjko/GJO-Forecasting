But that figure conceals a wide variation among pollsters, who put the Tories\u2019 lead at anything between 15 percentage points (enough for a landslide) and just six (which might mean a hung parliament). The latter would be good news for Labour, because Mr Johnson, having promised a hard Brexit, would find it hard to woo other parties into coalition.

Consequently, I have revised my forecast downwards, to 70:30. Having looked at all the polls, this time round, there is very little difference between MRP model conclusions and national average conclusions: a Tory majority is the most probable outcome, but a hung Parliament is possible. So what will happen? I go to first principles: what is the defining issue of the election and who wins on that issue, if anyone? The issue is easy to see: Brexit. In another era, \"NHS for Sale\" would cost the Tories the election, but Brexit is the big hairy beast that makes the slithering snake beside it look like a guardian angel. Furthermore, in terms of shifting votes, the Clinton-Trump election is instructive: for all his mendacity, Hillary Clinton had bigger trust issues than Donald Trump, precisely because people expected him to be duplicitous. \"NHS for Sale\" as an example of an issue that is not-Brexit, is not something that can really hurt the Tories because it is not a surprise. Who wins on the defining issue: the Tories, because they offer closure, whether you think Brexit is a historical triumph or the greatest self-inflicted geopolitical blunder of the last 6 or so decades. This does not mean a hung Parliament won't happen, I am simply explaining why a Tory majority is more likely. I will deny saying any of this when a hung Parliament emerges!

Reading through the polls that use MRP, they predicted somewhere between 340 on a low end to 360. The poles that use MPR in previous election were 93 percent accurate. Assuming that there are all inaccurate for the and are going to apply to Tories, then it's going to drop to 315ish.  For the Tories to lose the majority they are going to have to lose 30 something seats, which is doable and has history from the previous PM. But, the circumstances with brexit were much different especially when it come to her own party.  The bleedover effect is something that is interesting in the circumstances. Looking at electoral prediction maps, there is a real possibility that the ideas of \nLabour are being attacked by the Tories. That makes me think that there are going to be more errors in favor of Tories than with labour. Which gives it a majority.  Back in late October early November, there were pamphlets that were found that showed that the Tories were gearing up for an ugly election this month. The pamphlets were blaming labour for the problem of brexit. That makes me think that Tories are better prepared with a better narrative.   There are also reports of the labour being undersatisfied with their narrative.  That gives me pause to believe that they're doing well. And they're planning on pivoting in the next two days.  That worries me that they're changing message which makes me believe that they're not doing so hot.  Then there's the Hillary problem. I was reading a report about tactical voting.  Where people who support the Tories are not voting for their first choice.  Messaging doesn't work as well with an uninspired leader because of the initial believers. If we use an analogy of a Bass Diffusion Differental Equation. Word of mouth doesn't spread as well because it's not engaging.

I looked at polling by company/poll, assuming that each poll used the same methodology each time.  I looked for trends:  up or down during that period, and between the last 2 polls done by that company. The \"mega\" (ha!) trend is downward for Conservative support since Nov 15th, with ALL polls showing lower (or the same) results as first reported after 11/15.   However, the most recent trend (looking at the last 2 polls by each pollster) shows an upward trend for Conservatives by 6 out of 11 pollsters. I also looked at seat projections as recorded on wikipedia.  There has been consistent projections of a significant Conservative majority.  The most recent projections are for a greater majority, though less than in mid-November, averaging in the last 4 projections a 33-seat majority for Conservatives.

BrandsEye experimented with huge success in forecasting Brexit and trump's victory, but, alas, they are not in the game this time round. Datapraxis, who also use an MRP model, predict a 38-seat majority, though, Paul Hilder, the CEO, adds this proviso: \u201cWe have never seen as many undecided voters this late in the campaign. As many as 80-90 constituencies are still up for grabs. A much larger Conservative landslide is still possible - but so is a hung parliament.\u201d YouGov MRP model suggested the Tories were on course for a majority of 68.  Best for Britain, a group lobbying for a second referendum, commissioned an MRP poll that forecast 345 seats for the Tories - or a majority of 40. Stopping a Tory majority is still possible. I think undecideds will either stay at home or mirror the rest of the electorate and give the Tories a majority. However, Best for Britain suggests tactical voting by 41,000 voters in just 36 swing seats could prevent prevent a Tory majority. I am disinclined, silly fellow that I am, to believe that people are capable of that degree of cynicism and calculation, but it remains a possibility.  I have discounted other polls because they work on national averages, rather than on a seat-by-seat basis, like the MRP based polls, creating a distortionary effect. However, even national averages show a Tory lead (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_United_Kingdom_general_election).  broadly, as @nigster's analysis shows, there is a durable average lead across various polls of over 10%, and the Tories only need a 7 point victory to secure a majority. This is a come-to-Jesus moment: the Tories will secure a majority.  My feeling is, few have an appetite for second referendums, new negotiations with the EU, etc. Sheer Brexit exhaustion allied with a very good ground game on the part of the Tories, who have managed to define the election -as they nearly always do-, Corbyn's indecisive and divisive leadership, and the lack of a true third party, should see the Tories emerge as the biggest party in Parliament, with a majority.  Finally, politics is about simplicity. As @TheFutureIsHere said, \"The conservative party promises to follow through on the referendum result about Brexit. This is a clear message that will probably appeal to the majority of voters.\" I am not sure what Labour really wants. No Brexit? New negotiations? A vote for Labour does not offer clarity and I believe simplicity of messaging and rigorous organization trumps all.

What's more is that the polled vote share for remain (52%) and leave (48%) has been relatively static (3).

With people\u2019s perceptions of the likely election outcome perhaps playing a part in who they end up voting for, ICM this week sought to understand what the public think will happen come December 12 (Para. 4). Three in ten people think that the most likely outcome of the election is that the Conservatives will win \u2018with a majority of less than 50 seats\u2019 (29%), making it the single most commonly predicted outcome. One in five people think that the Tories will win \u2018with a majority of more than 50\u2019 (19%), meaning that, overall, just under half of the public think that a Conservative majority is the most likely outcome (48%). Just under a quarter of people think that a hung parliament is the most likely thing to happen come December 12 (23%), while one in ten think that a Labour majority is the most likely eventuality, with 6% predicting a Labour majority of less than 50 seats and 4% predicting a Labour majority of more than 50 seats. One in five people do not know what outcome they think is most likely (19%). Among those who intend to vote Conservative, confidence seems to be high. Combining the four in ten who think that the Conservatives will win with a handsome majority of over 50 (39%) and the four in ten who think they will win with a more modest majority (43%), over eight in ten of those who intend to vote Conservative think that their party of choice will win a majority (82%) (Para. 4-7).\n*\nReference\n*\nICM Unlimited Website.

Current analysis:\nEverybody over the last week seems to be showing Labour up and the LibDems down, and in most cases both models show a decline in the Conservative majority over what was predicted a week ago as a result.  The question is, is this a fluctuation or a trend?  Are we seeing just a random bump, or are we seeing people moving toward their true voting intention? In a normal election, we'd expect a trend; people shifting from the smaller parties to their more-preferred larger one, which will mostly look in the polls like LibDem to Labour.  I was suspicious that it would be atypical this time because of the large role of Brexit and the LibDem position as the lead anti-Brexit party.  But like last election, the issues seem to be steadily moving away from Brexit regardless. I accordingly am updating further in favor of \"No political party will gain an overall majority\".  Unless something dramatic happens, I expect to see a moderate additional shift from LibDem to Labour, with a smaller, partially-offsetting shift from Brexit to Conservative, and thus an increase in the chance of the Conservatives not managing to get a majority."], [1333, "2019-12-01T23:11:26Z", [0.96, 0.0, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-01T22:49:44Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-01T21:35:24Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29875, "2019-12-01T20:09:01Z", [0.08, 0.02, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [57797, "2019-12-01T19:58:57Z", [0.67, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33], ""], [691, "2019-12-01T19:18:29Z", [0.92, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08], ""], [59882, "2019-12-01T19:16:19Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35], "Reducing 'Yes, Con' from 70% because the Tory lead in the polls is down to 10%.

Analysis: In the raw popular support, the Conservatives seem to be averaging the same overall support that they had on polling day in 2017; all the polls (except the Independent's) have them within the margin of error on the 43.43% they got that year.  Labour support, however, is way down, with the Liberal Democrats way up.  The Brexit Party seems to be polling ahead of UKIP's 2017 results, though it's small enough that polling errors might be an issue.  It is notable that many polls are only polling Brexit Party in constituencies where it's running, which is substantially fewer constituencies than UKIP was running in in 2017. So, there are perhaps two paths to Labour managing to recover. The first is Johnson making a serious blunder like May did on long-term care and scaring voters currently voting their Brexit preference into swapping to a \"Stop the Tories\" vote.  The problem with that is that everybody remembers what happened to May, and is presumably going to do his best to avoid that. The second is anti-Brexit voters currently supporting the LibDem/Green/Cymru alliance looking at a Conservative majority and deciding they prefer Labour's wishy-washiness to Johnson being able to push through his deal.  The problem with the second is that a good deal of the anti-Brexit coalition is from a \"Brexit is bad for business\" perspective, and neither Corbyn's comments on the sort of Brexit he wants nor his new back-to-the-Seventies Labour manifesto do anything but push that sort of voter away from Labour."], [78343, "2019-11-22T12:13:40Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [27461, "2019-11-22T11:55:18Z", [0.98, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [78237, "2019-11-22T11:25:46Z", [0.65, 0.07, 0.0, 0.28], ""], [14813, "2019-11-22T10:51:23Z", [0.25, 0.2, 0.2, 0.35], "A signifcant minority of traditional Tory voters will not back BoJo due the hardline Brexit stance.

Labour are being squeezed by the Brexit Party in their traditional heartlands in the North East, the Midlands and South Wales, and by the Lib Dems in remain voting London. The Lib Dems decision to not form an alliance with Labour will definitely hurt both of them.

Averaging the two sets of percentages yields a 68% Cons win.\n\n[1]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2019_United_Kingdom_general_election#Graphical_summary\n[2]  https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html\n[3]  https://www.predictit.org/markets/5/World"], [62808, "2019-11-05T23:06:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [62808, "2019-11-05T23:05:12Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [80448, "2019-11-05T21:59:16Z", [0.35, 0.03, 0.02, 0.6], ""], [1333, "2019-11-05T19:04:08Z", [0.45, 0.05, 0.05, 0.45], ""], [79508, "2019-11-05T18:27:54Z", [0.78, 0.04, 0.0, 0.18], ""], [79326, "2019-11-05T18:16:30Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [14107, "2019-11-05T18:07:01Z", [0.52, 0.11, 0.02, 0.35], ""], [78237, "2019-11-05T16:49:37Z", [0.52, 0.14, 0.0, 0.34], ""], [79104, "2019-11-05T16:20:37Z", [0.39, 0.02, 0.0, 0.59], ""], [42004, "2019-11-05T15:44:54Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [1333, "2019-11-05T15:23:41Z", [0.53, 0.05, 0.05, 0.37], ""], [80445, "2019-11-05T14:05:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Independents will gain more seats."], [32063, "2019-11-05T12:51:25Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [19127, "2019-11-05T12:12:43Z", [0.44, 0.03, 0.0, 0.53], ""], [80427, "2019-11-05T11:17:30Z", [0.19, 0.23, 0.07, 0.51], "Based upon the actions of the Western and European  liberalism it is creating a curve that causes for a more conservative American and European stance as the correction.

I will also consider some base rates, and the simplest steps to a majority. If I look like I have built a story/convincing myself of something, please let me know in the comments. A majority is 326 seats. I will email asking for confirmation but it does not seem to me that a Lib Dem led coalition would count - to me, an overall majority means one party winning one. 1/Yes, the Conservative Party - 58% In the Politico Poll of Polls (https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/) the conservatives currently have a lead of 13%, sat at 37%, ahead of the labour party on 24%. They have a clear main priority, \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d which to the low information voters in their target seats and to a brexit weary voting population is a simple message.  Most voters do not pay attention to the vast majority of politics, but know big picture things - \u201cwe voted to leave, we haven\u2019t left, why - Parliament\u201d This election is \u201cnecessary\u201d as there is no majority in Parliament for any resolution to the main issue of the day. I expect there to be a difference in the quality of the 2017 election campaign, which was not necessary, had no focus and ended up with poor policies front and centre. Most campaigns make very little difference unless you run them very poorly. They will be squeezed in London and in some remain voting constituencies, but in those constituencies the vote could well be split between the Labour and Lib Dems. There is a threat this could equally apply to Labour picking up seats where the Brexit Party splits the Conservative vote in seats they haven\u2019t won in decades.  I think if you look at the lead they have, and the message, I think they will get a majority. I am not predicting a landslide, but I think they will get over the line. 2/Yes, the Labour Party - 1% It would have to be a massive reversal of fortunes for this to occur. They have been flat at around 24/6% in the poll of polls since Boris Johnson became leader. Their own leader is very, very unpopular although there may be a \u201cshy labour\u201d voting effect going on, where people dont like the leader but still revert to type on polling day. They do not have a clear message, and I do not think this is likely at all.  3/Yes, a political party not listed above - 0% There has not been a majority non labour or conservative government since before the second world war. No party is expected to do this, but even if it turns out that coalitions count they are likely to be headed by the Labour party not any other. 4/No political party will gain an overall majority - 41% Given the potential for splits in all the areas where the conservatives, labour and lib dem parties this is the second most likely option after a con majority. I do not think that tactical voting will work out for the opposition parties. Other remarks There have been 20 general elections since 1945, 2 have resulted in hung parliaments, 10 wins by a conservative gov and 8 by labour, but this includes 1 minority gov and 1 coalition. I am hesitant to apply this slight advantage to the conservatives in winning for two reasons 1/brexit referendum in 2016 2/this is the 3rd election into a conservative administration. These two reasons mean that the voters may not see this as a direct continuation of a conservative government, with a very different national conversation focused on brexit.  Unlike in the US, fundraising is not regularly released so we cannot use it as a proxy to see how donors view the strength of a campaign.  As this is a winter election, it should be expected that don\u2019t knows/less motivated voters are less likely to want to brave the cold to vote. However, in the UK voters can use postal votes. Turnout has been increasing since the low in 2001/returning to the historical norm of 70ish%, it will be interesting to see if this continues.  https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Kingdom_general_elections https://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2019/10/31/election-2019-region-by-region-guide-to-the-most-volatile-el https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/\n"], [73050, "2019-11-04T23:14:16Z", [0.71, 0.0, 0.0, 0.29], ""], [1333, "2019-11-04T19:06:31Z", [0.54, 0.05, 0.05, 0.36], ""], [80173, "2019-11-04T19:04:44Z", [0.3, 0.06, 0.0, 0.64], ""], [37413, "2019-11-04T18:01:51Z", [0.1, 0.09, 0.0, 0.81], ""], [691, "2019-11-04T16:15:36Z", [0.42, 0.01, 0.0, 0.57], ""], [80431, "2019-11-04T16:00:16Z", [0.2, 0.15, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [77, "2019-11-04T14:35:18Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.05, 0.5], ""], [79104, "2019-11-04T14:13:16Z", [0.35, 0.03, 0.0, 0.62], ""], [79781, "2019-11-04T13:08:55Z", [0.38, 0.25, 0.02, 0.35], "Polls suggest Tory support is increasingly dominant, with Labour static.

Inside View: \nI'm putting this in while I'm in church. I'm going to take another look at this later. But, if I remember things correctly from my previous Brexit Forecasts, the Tory's have been preparing for an election even before a deal was agreed upon in the EU.  And there were pamphlets being spread out talking about the dems screwing everything up before the deal made it to the Speaker of the house.   Also, after having a conversation with @kerryb (I think), there were things brought up on her end saying that there is definite brexit fatigue from the people living in Ireland. And paying attention to some news, people are sick of it.  I think this election has to do with the Tory's swinging up some nationalist support. But I have to look into what districts are up for grabs this time around.  But then again, Labour doesn't have nearly enough votes to win an election, so if people vote for labour. They are kind of in a sort voting to stay in Purgatory (appropriate given I am in church right now) . And given the amount of being tired of brexit, and labour not having a chance.

This trend will continue; helpful for the conservatives if it happens sooner rather than later, but even at the end, if the conservatives have a reasonable lead, tactical voting will occur.   People will not choose Brexit if it means throwing their vote away.  Boris is a much better campaigner than theresa may (remainer at heart).   Additionally, by his actions he has demonstrated that he is serious about leaving.  Witness willingness to toss conservatives in name only, and to his fights in Parliament.   I don't think remainers have any serious second thoughts about voting for Boris.  In my opinion, boris does slightly better in NI, and significan't better than TM in the rest of GB.  =================\nLooking at the rest of parties:  tactical voting will *not* happen between the SNP and Labor.  Scottish voters will vote SNP, on the strength of their remain sentiments and the weakness of the Labor position here-to-for.  Greens will be lose tactical votes to labor.  Sorry.  This election is not about environment - its Remain v. Exit.  Labor.    Tried to eat its cake and have it to, without taking a position on brexit.   Sure, they will be the default vote for Remain - but it will be hard for voters to get excited about a man that once was pro brexit.  He turns off a lot of voters, and I don't think Corbyn can change his spots.  =================== Polls are going to show this to be close.

Despite the polling lead the Tories have at present, i do not think it is a cut and dried outcome that they will win the election. A lot will depend on the line taken by both Johnson and Corbyn. If Corbyn plays to the people and ignores his own instinct, he may offer an olive branch second referendum option (may, but probably won't). Johnson is playing a dangerous game by calling the election IMHO. He is already under scrutiny for conflict of interest issues, is not exactly trustworthy given his track record and has lost every motion/vote he has brought to the Commons so far. Labour could/should play on this to their advantage, and BJ may not be as teflon as he thinks.  At this early stage I think a hung parliament is likely, with a Tory win more likely than a Labour win.

Was this one of the eight bins in the last question? Part of me thinks that brexit is just an elaborate scam by gjopen to generate questions. I mean come on, how long can this thing go on for? Is the end even near?  As for predictions: As @Chrisp and others have mentioned, base rate for a party getting a majority is around 70%. In addition, conservatives seem well ahead of the pack right now in terms of polling. [1] Conservatives basically called this election too, which suggests they believe it'll help them out - read that as give them a majority. Otherwise, calling an election when in control is a pretty odd move. Relative to the crowd, I think I trust Johnson's political acumen. I don't think he would call this election if he thought he would lose his spot as PM and I think he'll run a better campaign than Corbyn.    Similarly, it seems basically impossible for Labour to get a majority. They're polling 10-13 points behind the Conservatives, no one likes Corbyn, and the conservatives are the ones who seem most excited for the election. Obviously, a lot can change in two months, but going from 25 percent to a requisite 35 percent seems unlikely.  I'm a little surprise how down the crowd is on conservatives getting a majority. I'll drop a little from the base rate a bit with respect to both the crowd and the general volatility of British politics recently.

However Farage hates the proposed Boris deal and although Farage has been very quiet so far, when purdah kicks-in he will get a voice and be gunning for the Tories, so I expect the gap between the two parties to narrow. There seems little hope of a truce between the two brexit factions.

Over recent years they have alienated their traditional working class base [3] by embracing middle class liberal values and now by being ambiguous wrt the issue of brexit. Working class voters voted leave [4] by about 2 to 1. If Labour get any traction in this GE it will be by accident.
