However, I think the larger question to ponder here is whether war between the United States and North Korea has now become inevitable.  It's one thing to have North Korea brandishing a few missiles and a few nuclear weapons.  One can cling to the hope that various anti-missile systems will be effective.   However, it seems undeniable that North Korea intends to build thousands of nuclear ICBMs and has the intent to use them.  There is no way that any anti-missile defense will be effective against thousands of incoming warheads.  Like it or not, the United States now faces an existential threat unless North Korea is stopped.   If this war is inevitable, the only question is timing.   If the United States strikes first (and soon), 25 million people may die.  Most casualties will occur in North and South Korea, but some will occur in Japan and the United States.  This will be horrible, but at least one can envision a future beyond it.  Fifty million Koreans will survive and the Korean peninsula can be rebuilt under a unified democratic regime.   Unfortunately, the alternative is far worse.  If war comes later, missile defenses will be overwhelmed.  Hundreds of millions of Americans will die instantly and they will be the lucky ones.   Most American cities will be destroyed.  Infrastructure will be devastated.  The economy will be in ruins.  The power grid will be gone.  Supply chains will be crushed.  Food and fuel will dry up.  No transportation.  No healthcare.  Crime and looting.  Millions of \"lucky survivors\" will die in the ensuing chaos, and it won't be pretty.  The United States will be finished as country.   Korea will be worse off in this scenario too.  Many more Koreans will be dead, and there will be no \"Marshall Plan\" to rebuild and stabilize the Korean Peninsula."], [368, "2017-09-15T19:56:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368,

While the United States has maintained an uneasy calm with North Korea for more than six decades and spikes in tensions are not new, recent supercharged rhetoric between the unpredictable U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have heightened the risk of miscalculation that could make that nightmare a reality, they say. On Thursday, North Korea upped the ante by saying it would complete plans by mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, after Trump said that any threats by Pyongyang would be \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" The exchange followed a United Nations resolution tightening sanctions on North Korea after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads to the United States. Trump said on Thursday his fire and fury comment was not tough enough. Despite the war of words, for now the U.S. military says there has been no change in its readiness posture in South Korea or elsewhere in Asia. Analysts say they have seen no evidence of any increased alert in North Korea (para. 1-6). Brunnstrom, D. (2017). Any new Korean war could quickly escalate to catastrophe. Reuters. World News.

Sometimes I try to figure out what opposing parties seem to see as  their BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).   It seems to me that the NK BATNA is clear:  keep building more missiles and nuclear weapons no matter what.   At the same time, the US doesn't seem to have a clear idea of its BATNA.   One possible option for the US might be to deploy as many ABM sites as possible, with the idea of shooting down NK missile launches.  Although the record of successful shoot-downs has improved over the years, ABM technical challenges do not assure 100% success.  Also US ABM success seems to have been with short and medium range situations, not ICBM.   In the medium term, the likelihood of success for this defense strategy will deteriorate.  It will be overwhelmed by the building of hundreds of missiles and the eventual application of MIRV capability.   I think the true BATNA for the US is to accept the inevitability of a second Korean War, and to make preparations to win it decisively and quickly in the near term, while that can still be done.  I don't think that this understanding will be reached in the next month or two,  I'm also betting that NK will not act immediately.

This same story or something very similar has been reported earlier this year, last year and regularly since 2013. So it is not really news today. Maybe it is politically convenient to make a lot of noise about it now? It is not believed that NK has the capability to start a nuclear war with the continental USA.  (No evidence a NK ICBM can get through re-entry). \nThe thing Kim wants is to have the capability to hit the continental USA with a nuclear bomb. Next best is for the USA to believe he has that capability. He does not seem any risk of being overthrown (as far as I can tell). Provoking an incident that is not part of tests to get his nuclear ICBMs working would not seem to be useful to him. \nOn the other hand Trump might be tempted to show NK how much \"fire and fury\" the US has, but the US military probably has sense to take more care.

The more likely scenario is some incident quickly leads to an escalation and the gloves come off.

The North's official news agency said it was mulling a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets around Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. The statement marks a sharp rise in rhetoric between the two countries. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions against the country. President Trump's comments followed a media report that claimed the North had made a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. The Washington Post report, which cited US intelligence officials, suggests North Korea is developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. The North's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said its military was \"carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12\". It said the plan would be reported to the Supreme Command after \"full examination and completion\" and put into practice at the order of leader Kim Jong-un, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. The heated rhetoric between the US and North Korea intensified after Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. Mr Trump told reporters on Tuesday: \"North Korea best not make any more threats to the US. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" Veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement. \"The great leaders that I have seen they don't threaten unless they are ready to act and I'm not sure that President Trump is ready to act.\" said Senator McCain.\n "], [529, "2017-08-08T23:35:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "8/8/17: Trump comments (ref. below) could be (ratcheted-up) \"sabre-rattling\", but I'm not in a position to be 100% certain at this point...\nSlight increase to before-9/30/17 forecast for now. http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/08/politics/north-korea-missile-ready-nuclear-weapons/index.html http://time.com/4892492/donald-trump-john-mccain-north-korea-nuclear-threat/ http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/08/trump-north-korea-warning-241409"], [35618, "2017-08-08T21:36:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [368, "2017-08-08T19:49:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-08T05:58:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-08-07T20:20:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [36328, "2017-08-07T05:22:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T04:18:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-08-07T03:59:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [529, "2017-08-07T03:32:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], "Additional international pressure/attention upon N.

One observer ( and despite claims to prophecy) cannot be assumed to be reliable is George Friedman. Here is his view that came across my desk and I do  not endorse it at all, I hope he is wrong. I wish I could refute it: but who really knows? here it is: from https://geopoliticalfutures.com/north-korea-stares-abyss/ \"Kim has only bad choices, but for a few reasons, the least bad choice for him is war. First, it\u2019s possible that the U.S. is bluffing and that nothing will come from this episode. Second, it\u2019s possible that China or Russia will intervene to save him, though neither country is up to the task of fighting a conventional war with the U.S. (Neither country is all that interested in saving the Kim government either.) It\u2019s possible that South Korea, afraid for Seoul, will block the attack. It\u2019s possible that Japan will get involved. It\u2019s possible that the U.S. attack will fail. It\u2019s possible that the nuclear program is further along than everyone thinks and that that will deter an attack.\nBarring this last scenario, it seems to me that the U.S. cannot refuse to go to war unless North Korea capitulates. North Korea cannot capitulate. Neither country wants to go to war, but neither can accept what is happening without war. My best guess is that North Korea currently does not have a weapon that could be readily delivered by stealth, and it would have to be demonstrated before an attack began, not after. I think we are looking at the prospect of a few weeks of quiet diplomacy and noisy public threats that will lead to war.\nThe signs are all there. The United States does not deploy the force it has deployed unless it\u2019s serious. Such was the case in Desert Storm, in Kosovo, and in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. By sending the USS Nimitz, the U.S. is telling North Korea, in no uncertain terms, that war is approaching. Now, it is North Korea\u2019s move. Pyongyang had been quiet for a few days until firing a missile on May 28, which landed in the Sea of Japan. Still, you have to consider that North Korea is staring down into the abyss\".

Security Council response - such as sanctions - to North Korea's repeated ballistic missile launches, which the 15-member body normally condemns in a statement, diplomats said. It was not immediately clear how open Beijing might be to new sanctions. The council has traditionally boosted sanctions in response to North Korea's five nuclear tests and two long-range rocket launches. Sanctions were first imposed on Pyongyang in 2006. North Korea has in the past year stepped up its missile tests, firing dozens of various types of rockets, according to South Korea. The most recent test, which failed, came on Friday following a U.N. Security Council meeting on North Korea, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \"The cumulative actions of the DPRK (North Korea) since their last nuclear test compel us to look at a range of measures that would apply pressure,\" said a spokesman for the U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday. \"As Secretary Tillerson said on Friday, business as usual is not an option. We are exploring options for a response to this series of provocations with our Security Council colleagues,\" the spokesman said. Tillerson on Friday urged the Security Council to act before North Korea does. The Trump administration has been aggressively pressing Beijing to rein in its ally and neighbor North Korea, warning that all options were on the table if Pyongyang persists with its nuclear and missile development. But China has said military threats would not help the situation and has accused the United States of fueling tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Beijing on Tuesday reiterated its opposition to the deployment of the U.S.' THAAD anti-missile defense system in South Korea and urged it to be halted immediately. The last round of complex sanctions imposed by the Security Council took three months to negotiate following Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test in September. Those measures aimed to cut North Korea's annual export revenue by a quarter. Traditionally, the United States and China have negotiated new sanctions before involving remaining council members. U.N. diplomats said the current talks were still just between the pair (para. 1-11). Nichols, M. (2017). U.S., China talk firmer U.N. response to North Korea's missiles: diplomats. Reuters.

But Defense News\u2019 Chris Cavas has figured it out, discovering that the ships aren\u2019t parked off the Korean coast, but rather are operating several hundred miles south of Singapore, taking part in scheduled exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean.  \u201cOn Saturday \u2013 according to photographs released by the U.S. Navy \u2013 the carrier passed north through the Sunda Strait, the passage between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. It's about 3,500 miles from Korea,\u201d Cavas writes. And there you have it.

DPRK has in the past randomly shelled the ROK. Nothing convincing yet suggests the ROK or US is committed to abandoning caution and will provoke the DPRK. The Trump administration has so far walked back many Presidential tweets/campaign pledges on foreign policy. \nThe discrepancy between the prob for Apr-Jun and Jul-Sep periods is purely due to the date today. We also got through the Easter weekend DPRK parade without incident. The high numbers reflect the apparent red line drawn by the administration, especially the statement that the US has 'lost strategic patience' with the DPRK.

He knows that the US does not dare to use nuclear weapons against him, nor does China. He knows that China, the US and SK are aware that NK could attack SK with conventional weapons which could kill thousands of people. Although China could beat NK in a war, China is afraid that NK might go down fighting and take SK with it, leaving China to pick up the pieces. If SK were attacked it could no doubt hit back, but at a high cost. \nAll this means that retaliation by China, USA or SK to provocation by NK has to be very carefully balanced; too little and they appear weak; too much and they risk an escalation by NK. As Kim does not care if a few of his subjects are killed he is quite capable to taking some action that results in a small number of South Koreans being killed (e.g. sinking a fishing boat or two, shelling boarder guards) and daring SK (or the US) to hit back. If they do not hit back Kim would count that as a glorious victory, if they do hit back as a tit for tat action Kim can use it as propaganda in NK to prove that NK is surrounded by countries that are planning to attack NK. Experience has shown that SK and the US have no real answer to this sort of action by NK.   \nThe number of border incidence has reduced as the provocations of atomic bomb tests and missile tests has increased, but that does not mean that NK could not go back to shelling, torpedoing ships, planting land mines and just shooting people if it feels it need to make point. With the US sending ships towards NK and the THAAD system on its way, NK may decide to do something.

The projectile was launched from an area near the North's Dongchang-ri long-range missile site at 7:36 a.m. and flew across the country before splashing into the East Sea, JCS said in a text message. \"We are conducting an analysis on the projectile to determine its type and flight range. It will take a while before we come up with a final analysis (based on U.S. satellite data),\" the JCS said. It could be an ICBM capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, an official at the defense ministry said. On Friday, Pyongyang threatened to conduct more missile firings in response to the two-month-long Foal Eagle exercise between Seoul and Washington, which lasts through April. The Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party's official newspaper, said in a commentary that \"new types of strategic weapons will soar\" if Seoul and Washington continue their annual war drills, which the North claims to be a preparation for a war against it."], [29970, "2017-03-05T22:11:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [368, "2017-03-05T20:09:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1297, "2017-03-05T15:55:38Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [4634, "2017-03-05T10:22:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.04, 0.92], ""], [1034, "2017-03-05T07:11:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-04T17:44:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1331, "2017-03-04T17:28:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Even though the dictator of the PDRK is a idiot he won't take the chance of starting another conflict"], [691, "2017-03-04T11:52:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.96], ""], [29469, "2017-03-04T11:01:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [1034, "2017-03-04T08:12:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-04T02:58:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.96], ""], [368, "2017-03-03T21:07:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2017-03-03T14:26:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.02, 0.96], ""], [1034, "2017-03-03T06:38:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [26030, "2017-03-03T01:43:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.01, 0.98], ""], [368, "2017-03-02T19:37:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [20968, "2017-03-02T19:31:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [1034, "2017-03-02T06:24:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [3316, "2017-03-02T01:29:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34071, "2017-03-01T23:54:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [32777, "2017-03-01T23:25:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], "This is a relatively easy prediction to make.

The KoreanInstitute for National Unification, a state-backed think tank, has tallied up dozens of reported cases of suspected retaliation.\nChina hasn\u2019t confirmed any reprisals but has at times belied a link between its actions and South Korea\u2019s planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. The two nations\u2019 foreign ministers traded barbs over Thaad this past weekend at a security conference in Munich.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, in an English-language commentary, warned the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group on Sunday that it was \u201cplaying with fire\u201d over its plan to allow Seoul to deploy Thaad on its land.\nThe dispute adds a new wrinkle to Northeast Asia\u2019s complex network of alliances and antipathies as Pyongyang moves closer to its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the continental U.S. Last week, it launched another missile test that experts say advanced that goal. The killing last week of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s half brother in a Malaysian airport added to Mr. Kim\u2019s reputation for ruthlessness and unpredictability, sparking new fears in South Korea. Officials in Seoul hold Mr. Kim responsible.\nSeoul recently launched a task force to hear complaints from South Korean businesses operating in China and discuss possible countermeasures to Beijing\u2019s alleged retaliation over Thaad. Some lawmakers have called for a formal complaint at the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cWe will keep raising the issue with the China side resolutely and continuously, while judging facts objectively and responding reasonably,\u201d said Korean Vice Trade Minister Woo Tae-hee recently (para.1-7).

( See Musudan and September 2016  nuclear test No. 5) There have been no reported casualties since KIm III commenced his reign,\nWhy?\nKim III will not risk triggering any military confrontation until The DPRK nuclear deterrent is ready and, (perhaps more importantly) perceived as capable of   launching an IRBM that can  accurately target, ROK, Japan and Guam. That is the main purpose of the nuclear deterrent, to prevent US and or ROK from initiating regime change via an amphibious landing or other means. I assume KIm III is an absolute dictator with complete command, control, and communications with the DPRK armed forces. Last result, KIm III desires is any lethal comfrontation until he can hold ROK and Japan as nuclear hostages. As the estimated time for Kim III  to complete his deterrent is (coincidentally) about October 2017;\nthere will be no DPRK initiated lethal comfrontations, and I see no possible US-ROK initiated lethal confrontations during that time period. Short of an accident, there is no chance of such a confrontation.\nMorover, while Kim III record has been one of continued provocations, Kim III has no record of such a confrontation and actually has an imperative of preventing any incident that could  provide even a plausible rationale for a US/ROK pre-emptive strike. The US has a demonstated capability of such a strike.
