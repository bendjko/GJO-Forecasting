It averaged over 5k a day for the last week.  Well over 95% of Covid cases in the UK are caused by the delta variant at the moment and though the amount of cases is declining, the total amount will certainly stay over 2k/day for the coming weeks (it is at 25 000 right now*). The limiting factor is thus the amount of cases that are genotyped or sequenced each day. In England alone, this number hasn't dropped below 2000/day since the end of May when the total amount of detected cases there was barely above 2000 (see note\u00b2).\n\nThe last time fewer than 2000 confirmed/probable delta cases on average per day were reported for the whole of the UK was in the 3 June update with data till the 26th of May. In that week, there were fewer than 3000 cases/day on average* and many of those were still caused by the Alpha variant: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-variants-genomically-confirmed-case-numbers/variants-distribution-of-case-data-3-june-2021 The only way I see the 350 000 target not being reached by 11 August is if the UK suddenly stops sequencing/genotyping cases or if it stops testing within 1-2 days of this comment.

I was right that there was a big difference between a case number and a registered delta variant. Hence why the question remains live. I was wrong that the vaccine once given to young people would cause cases to plummet, as they rose quite quickly for longer than I forecast. My original forecast wasn't expecting it to be this close. Basically I overestimated the vaccine effect. But, case numbers are now falling, partly because of the (still weaker than expected) vaccine effect, and mostly because of school holidays, which are not going away before the end of this forecast. Latest figures say week on week falls of 21%.  So given case numbers are 286k as at 23 July (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-variants-genomically-confirmed-case-numbers/variants-distribution-of-case-data-23-july-2021), and that week increased cases by 33700, we see it will take about 3 weeks for the number to break 350k. This takes us to 13 August. And \"before 12 August 2021\" will not count the week anyway, so it seems we will run out of time just.  So I amend my forecast from 5% between 29 July and 11 August and 95% Not before 12 August to 35%, 65%, because it's going to the wire. But my forecast seems to be much better than the majority below even after the move. This demonstrates the value of trying to avoid relying on just one big idea. In this case, I had two (confirmed case != confirmed delta case and the vaccine effect), one seems to be pretty much bang on, and the other was overestimated.

It was 50% more transmissible than the original, and accounted for 90% of the UK cases at one point. \nDelta variant statistics: \nIt is 50% more contagious than Alpha, and has rapidly overcome Alpha and now accounts for 90% of the UK cases.\nCompared to the original, Delta spreads approximately 2.25 faster, and 1.5 faster than Alpha. My estimate for the amount of time is therefore approximately 2.2 months as of June 9, which makes it around August 18. Note that Alpha never exceeded 350K, primarily because it was overtaken by another variant. So, there is also a chance that a new variant arrives that makes the Delta variant never exceed 350K. The variants of concern (Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta), all emerged late 2020. There is a rising variant of interest (Lambda) that may have increased transmissibility, but as potential resistance to the vaccine. For me, this means the probability for a new variant is quite low, and more probable that Lambda will overtake Delta, which is still a low probability (~2%) before August 11.  Looking at vaccination rates, currently 50% of the population is fully vaccinated, and this number is still increasing. The cases from Alpha / the original were during a time when, while there were less people out, there were also much fewer vaccinations. Overall, I think these cancel each other out, with perhaps the current vaccinations making the Delta variant spread slightly slower than the original or Alpha variant.  Assuming a somewhat normal distribution for the time until the Delta variant exceeds 350K cases in the UK, this puts my probability that it happens before August 12 at slightly greater than 50%, with decreasing probabilities going earlier into the year. With only a week left before July 14, I see that it is highly unlikely that it breaks 350K cases before then. Freedom day will come on July 19, which might cause a spike in cases, but even then, there is not much time before July 28.

This exponential model is a common model for infections. Using https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57489740 we know up to June 16 there were almost 76,000 COVID cases caused by the Delta variant in the UK, and that the number of new COVID cases caused by the Delta variant is between around 90% and 100% of new COVID cases from around June 13 assuming trends continue (see graph in link). This is a reasonable assumption as the Delta variant continues to threaten the UK and be a major threat, and is corroborated as per this article which says the Delta variant accounts for 99% of COVID tests in the UK: https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-06-18/delta-variant-makes-up-nearly-all-new-uk-coronavirus-cases. The number of new COVID cases on June 16 was 8808 and the number of new COVID cases on July 5 is 27100. Assuming Delta variant accounts for the lower bound of 90% of COVID cases for both values we can solve to get c=7927.2, r=1.0609. Assuming Delta variant accounts for the upper bound of 100% of COVID cases for both values we can solve to get c=8808, r=1.0609 (note r is the same; this makes sense based on how one solves the equation). We want to find T so that the integral from 0 to T of cr^t dt is at least 350,000-76,000 = 274,000. We can evaluate this integral to be c/ln r (r^T-1). If we take c=7927.2 we get T >= 18.83 and if we take C=8808 we get T >= 17.65. These dates correspond to July 6th and July 4th respectively, that is today. This may see like a harsh prediction but it makes sense considering the 7 day average of COVID cases in the UK since July 5th is around 25k and the 7 day average of COVID cases from the week before is around 16k.

Additionally, we see that the last week added about 50,000 cases, which means that at the current rate, it would take about 4 weeks to hit 350,000.  The question now is what is the actual rate that we expect to see week over week for the delta variant. We have various factors to consider here; vaccination rates, lockdown and prevention measures, and delta transmissibility.  Vaccinations in the United Kingdom have slowed fairly drastically, to the point where about 67 percent of people have at least one dose, and we have a rate of about 1.4% increase in vaccination total every week. This increase, in my opinion, is negligible in the given time frame that we have which is capped at about 4 weeks.  We have seen that all major vaccinations (Moderna, Pfizer, AZ) have been effective against the delta variant, which is also a constant we can assume now, and that we have approximately 60% coverage if we scale the 18% population with only dose by their predicted protection of 75%.  We now consider the rate of infections in the United Kingdom - currently they have experienced a surge of 72% over the past week, and there isn't much hope of an effective lockdown - schools are being projected as breeding grounds for the variant, and its hard to close Pandora's box once its been opened, referencing the loosening of restrictions around day to day life. Vaccinations are protected against death and hospitalizations, which may indicate a desire for citizens to carry about their lives without as much of a concern as previous surges had instilled. During the winter surge, it was driven primarily by people below the age of 30, as well as moving indoors, which is indicative of what we're seeing now, with young people making up the majority of cases as well as hospital admissions.  The newest delta variant is forecasted to be 50% more transmissible than the alpha variant which was 50% more transmissible than the original covid strain. This means that we are facing an increase of more than 100% from the original covid strain, which stands to prove a risk against the strength of the vaccinations.  I believe that we can rely on the current trend, which is exponential, to continue for at least 2 weeks based on the makeup of the demographic getting infected and the increased transmissibility of the delta variant. After this, due to the maybe increased vaccinations taking hold and government action, we may face a leveling off, or a decline, but I would project a level to account for the possibility of increase as well.  July 2nd - July 9th: 80, 000 \nJuly 9th - July 16th: 130,000\nJuly 16th - July 23rd: 130,000 This projection would put us hitting our target before July 16, but how before is a tricky situation.

Plotting this out does somewhat seem like the start of some exponential function. If we run OLS just as a sanity check, we get 8/15/2021 as the date in which more than 350k cases are exceeded. It's worth noting this is the slowest of slowest cases (reported linearly throughout) and is quite close to the August 12 cutoff for the last option. Hence, if August 12 comes and the UK hasn't reported more than 350,000 cases, the UK would've likely had serious slowdowns in the their testing protocols. Considering tests are conducted twice a week in England at no charge, it seems like the country has a robust testing schedule ahead. An exponential model suggests that the date will drop between July 15 and July 28. Of course, any mild testing delay could nudge this number out of this 2-week range. Moreover, our sample size is small and with 62% of adults fully vaccinated, this exponential model might not run its course. For the other side, the country will still be in lockdown until July 19, making it less probable that we'll see a surge in infections or a surge in detection (again, it seems the UK has an incredibly robust testing scheme).

Due to testing limitations, and weekly trends, the earliest, I think the UK could reasonably hit this total by is July 25th (using the most recent weekly increase), but it is more likely to hit this total around August 3rd (averaging some of the weekly increases). That being said, current research is showing that a new, likely more transmissible strain (Delta plus) will be hitting the UK soon. Since a person cannot be affected by multiple viruses at once, the more transmissible strain can compete with the Delta strain and slow its growth.

Also, July 14th is 12 days away, which means the UK needs to average just under 16k cases a day for the next two weeks to reach it. This seems highly likely considering the recent surge in cases, as the last reported daily number was 27k. Even if it rises for a few more days before the UK can calm it down, it will very likely happen before July 14th, and if not, almost certainly by months end.

Public Health England says that the number of confirmed cases of the delta variant doubles every 4.5 to 11.5 days. While this is a wide range, we can look at the previous few weeks to get a sense of how fast the number of cases is growing. The last report from June 23 stated that there were over 111,000 cases. Over the past three weeks, the number of delta variants has grown by 46%, 81%, and  223%. The interesting thing to note here is that the percent increase of cases of the delta variant has been decreasing over this time range. This seems to imply that as the delta variant gets more prevalent, the United Kingdom may be taking more actions to prevent the spread of the virus.  All that being said, June 23 is three weeks before our first date July 14, and cases would only need to grow 46% per week in order to exceed 350,000. I think this seems like a very realistic possibility, and it does not seem like there needs to be a huge spike in cases in order for this number to be achieved. That being said, if there is any uptick in cases over the next few weeks, then we would definitely reach 350,000 before July 14.

Unless there is a significant decrease in the rate of change in the number of cases, there will be over 350,000 cases by July 28.

This question asks when the UK will have *genetically characterized* (by genotyping or sequencing) at least 350K cases as Delta. These are very different questions. Cases are growing much faster than they can be characterized. Laboratory characterization of strains appears to be a big bottleneck. The number of characterized Delta samples is going up like a 2nd degree polynomial, more slowly than cases. From June 16 to 23, there were 0.07M confirmed cases in the UK, nearly all of which were due to Delta, but only ~38k cases (all strains) were characterized. The percentage characterized seems to be falling. With a 2nd degree polynomial fit, my projection is that 350k cases will be characterized and recorded on the relevant website within the data in the week ending Aug. 4. This would require ~250k more samples between now and Aug. 4 to be characterized, or an average of ~42k/week. I think this is feasible, given that they're already processing ~38k/week. It shouldn't be too hard to ramp up characterization by 10% to 20%. Given that they haven't even been able to characterize 40k samples per week, the chance that 250k more samples will be characterized as Delta over the next 3 weeks is zero (i.e., the probability of bin 1 is zero). And unless they seriously ramp up testing, there's no way they'll characterize 350k samples as Delta by the end of July (bin 2). They're in the process of testing their new genotyping assay in national reference laboratories; if all goes well with that, it's conceivable that that genotyping capability could be expanded to other labs across the UK. So I'll give a little weight to bin 2. But I'll also give a little weight to bin 4.

Could the number increase as more sequencing is done?... why not... after all, it's not total cases it's confirmed and probable. I'm pretty sure I hate this question already...

That means roughly 240k July 9 and ~300k July 14, so hitting it before the 14th is unlikely, so I'll give it 15%. Then by July 28 it could easily happen so I'll give it 2-1 odds.

However, as vaccination rates increase, I think it's safe to locate closer to four cycles.  This would suggest about a month before reaching 350k.

That works out to about 4800 new Delta cases per day this past week.  Looking at COVID cases last year in the UK (when COVID was just introduced, similar to now, when Delta has just been introduced), the peak was about 5300 cases a day. This lasted for about two months. We can use this as a baserate for how fast infections will spread when a new variant is introduced in the UK.  The differences this summer from last year is that there is a vaccine, although it is less effective against Delta (33% efficacy in-between doses, src below) than against the original COVID. This presence of a vaccine leads me to expect a decrease from the baserate. However, on the other hand, lockdowns this year are less stringent than last year, leading me to expect an increase from the baserate. These factors sort of cancel out, and it's hard to quantify how much each factor will contribute to the final results; thus, I will just use last year's rate of about 5000 cases a day as a baserate. Using this rate, I expect Delta variant cases to exceed 350000 in the UK in (350000-75953)/5000 = 54.8 days. That comes to about August 15. Thus, I will center my prediction around August 15.  https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/delta-variant-jumps-33630-in-a-week-making-up-nearly-all-covid-19-cases-in-uk/articleshow/83643023.cms\nhttps://www.9news.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/colorado-covid-vaccines-protect-against-delta-variant/73-479b8b20-6b3f-46d8-8250-4d46aeb88579"], [85097, "2021-06-21T14:41:55Z", [0.01, 0.42, 0.15, 0.42], ""], [101467, "2021-06-21T14:41:30Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [101286, "2021-06-21T14:28:15Z", [0.02, 0.08, 0.3, 0.6], "Comment deleted on Jun 21, 2021 02:29PM UTC"], [101282, "2021-06-21T14:16:09Z", [0.44, 0.36, 0.18, 0.02], "Last week, COVID-19 cases rose 33,630 to a total of 75,953 -- this was largely among unvaccinated younger individuals who are now starting to receive the vaccine.

The total national cases seem to be about 4.63 million, but confirming Covid 19 vs confirming a specific variant is very different and the question relies solely on the above link.  So what we are really asking is whether there will be more cases of delta variant than the entirety of the rest of the pandemic.  Looking also only at the data, we got about 30k more cases between 2 June and today (21 June), so about 70k in total. At this rate, it will take (350-70) = 4 periods of 19 days = 76 days to reach 350k, which is about 2.5 months. This takes us to September. But that is the superficial look. Moving into the details, at the moment, the UK is heavily vaccinated with all those over 21 or so now being offered a first vaccine and with most over 40 being offered a second vaccine. And the evidence shows transmission of the delta variant is heavily reduced by the vaccine. In fact, we in the UK are very close to \"herd immunity\" now and even the delta variant cases are now being pushed into retreat. Further, areas with outbreaks of delta are being prioritised and this has succeeded in ending the local outbreak and virtually every single case of the delta variant appears to be happening in the increasingly small unvaccinated population.  On the other hand, infections are not linear, they are exponential so can grow very quickly. But this works both ways. They can shrink quickly too.  The evidence therefore shows the delta variant is on the wane and cannot sustain itself very long.  I therefore conclude a small chance (5%) of between 29 July and 11 August but a very high chance of never and certainly not before 12 August.  Why 5%? 1% chance of being spectacularly wrong and 4% because of the non-linearities of the exponential distribution. I observe my forecast is totally out of kilter with the rest of the community. But my forecast is my forecast and crowd views alone are not generally a direct input in my forecasts, particularly given the abundance of pure fear going around about the delta variant.
