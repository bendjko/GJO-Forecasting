This field testing provides data for PrecisionHawk\u2019s operational risk assessment that is a critical piece of the regulatory approval process.\u201d \n\u201cAARC and PrecisionHawk collaborated in Summer 2016 on field experiments to observe pilots\u2019 decision making when flying in extended VLOS (EVLOS). As a result of the collaboration, PrecisionHawk was able to attain the only EVLOS waiver in the nation from the FAA for commercial UAV operations\u201d (http://www.feedstuffs.com/news/applied-aviation-research-center-precisionhawk-continue-uas-collaboration)\n\u201cFrom the part 107 waiver PrecisionHawk can fly drones BVLOS during its commercial operations. Also under the waiver, PrecisionHawk is approved to train those who want to offer these EVLOS flights as a service. The waiver was granted based on over a years worth of testing under the pathfinder program\u201d (http://www.precisionhawk.com/media/topic/faa-grants-precisionhawk-bvlos-waiver/)\n\n\u201cPhase three is the final phase of the FAA Pathfinder program, all results are provided to the FAA for consideration upon completion of field tests\u201d \n(http://www.feedstuffs.com/news/applied-aviation-research-center-precisionhawk-continue-uas-collaboration) Will adjust forecast when PrecisionHawk announces the results. If the results yield valuable information which is encouraging to the FAA in terms of incorporating UAVs into commercial airspace, they may be more willing to approve Part 107 waivers for commercial operations - however, there is a time limitation of just over 4 months.

Although the Reauthorisation of the FAA Summary shows a step towards improving drone regulations for Amazon to conduct testing in the future, there are a couple of subjects that I would expect the FAA has to focus on before they can get on to \u201cDrone Package Delivery\u201d and \u201cOpportunities for Innovation\u201d. \nThe two subjects - \u201cDrone Safety Features\u201d and as @shsmith330 said \u201cPrivacy Protections\u201d - would have to go through research and evaluation procedures before Amazon could be considered for testing automated drone flights.  Bearing in mind the \u201cFAA Reauthorization Act of 2017\u201d reauthorises the FAA through to 2021 - I would expect it to take at least a year for FAA regulation to be implemented from the date the targets are laid out.\nAn example of the timeline for a subject matter being brought to the attention of the FAA and the date of implementing new regulation is pilot fatigue.

The White House released a 624 page document with new rules and regulations Tuesday pertaining to \u201cthe Commercial and Scientific Use of Drones,\u201d and business leaders are already responding. \u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the option of going through the traditional kind of five year time span in which we come up with regulatory outcomes and the standards,\u201d Sean Cassidy, the director of strategic partnerships at Amazon Prime Air, the company\u2019s conceptual drone-based delivery system, told The Washington Post in response to the new rules.\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2016/06/21/business-leaders-unsurprisingly-tepid-about-faas-new-624-page-drone-rulebook/ Amazon\u2019s Vice President for Global Public Policy, Paul Misener explains to Pogue that he hopes the United States is the first country to get drone delivery service, but that may not be the case:     \u201cWell, we have customers all around the world, of course. There\u2019s no reason why the United States must be first. We hope it is.\u201d https://www.inverse.com/article/10330-amazon-drone-delivery-30-minutes-and-5-pound-limits-for-prime-air The agency mandated that Amazon's drones fly no higher than 122 m, no faster than 161 km/h, and remain within the pilot's line of sight. These rules are consistent with a proposed set of FAA guidelines. Ultimately, Amazon hopes to operate in a slice of airspace above 61 m and beneath 152 m.It plans to fly drones weighing a maximum of 25 kg within a 16 km radius of its warehouses, at speeds of up to 80.5 km/h with packages weighing up to 2.26 kg in tow[1]. [1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Air Why Amazon is testing drone delivery in the U.K. \u2014 and not in the U.S.\nAmazon previously expressed frustration with the slow pace of the FAA\u2019s drone policy-making process.\nhttp://www.recode.net/2016/12/14/13955818/amazon-drone-delivery-uk-us-faa-testing"], [15133, "2017-03-14T19:17:25Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-03-14T17:39:41Z", [0.7], ""], [29591, "2017-03-14T17:16:20Z", [0.45], "There are some insightful comments from @flyn1200, @Raahul_Kumar and @mpuckette, much appreciated!  NASA\u2019s website on Unmanned Traffic Management, a project conducted with the FAA, gives the following information about the test UTM TCL4, but to give it some context first: The \u201cUTM TCL2, was completed in October 2016, leveraged TCL1 results and focused on beyond visual line-of-sight operations in sparsely populated areas. Researchers tested technologies that allowed dynamic adjustments to availability of airspace and contingency management\u201d and \u201cUTM TCL3, scheduled for January 2018, will leverage TCL2 results and focus on testing technologies that maintain safe spacing between cooperative (responsive) and non-cooperative (non-responsive) UAS over moderately populated areas.\u201d\nSo, I think it is the most relevant to Amazon\u2019s Prime Air as \u201cUTM TCL4, with dates to be determined, will leverage TCL3 results and focus on UAS operations in higher-density urban areas for tasks such as news gathering and package delivery. It will also test technologies that could be used to manage large-scale contingencies.\u201d \nI think the FAA will be relying on NASA\u2019s project to complete all of their research before they change the regulations on UAV\u2019s.  Amazons Prime Air plan differs from the other testing that is being carried out in the US by companies such as, 7-Eleven and UPS, as they all involve a line-of-sight rule. The UPS UAS project involves the driver of the vehicle piloting the drone to locations that are very rural/hard to access. Along with the issue of the law being that companies cannot fly drones out of visual line-of-sight, their main focus is what @mpuckette said about battery life. \u201cWhen the UPS driver approached the intended home for delivery\u2026she launched the drone from its roof. From there, the drone flew to the home based of a pre-programmed flight path, dropped off the package and then flew back to the van\u2026the van\u2019s roof opened and revealed a platform for the drone to land on, where it was able to plug itself into the battery charger.\u201d (http://fortune.com/2017/02/21/ups-drone-deliveries-florida/). Though this concept involves drones, it is different to what Amazon is planning for, i.e. wanting to deliver directly from their depot to a customers location by autonomous flight, and explains why it\u2019s been hard for them to get a certificate of waiver.  In the article from the guardian about Amazons Drone delivery project in the UK, it states: \u201cGovernment regulations in the UK are generally considered favourable to companies wanting to experiment with autonomous aircraft, but restrictions still heavily limit what Amazon can test\u201d (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/14/amazon-claims-first-successful-prime-air-drone-delivery). Amazon was able to get approval to test in the UK before the US but was still confined by heavy restrictions, it seems that Amazon has a long way to go before they have the vision they are dreaming of up and running, especially in the US.  On Amazon's website they state: \u201cThrough our private trial in the UK, we will gather data to continue improving safety and reliability of our systems and operations \u201d (amazon.com), which leads me to ask the question that other forecasters have asked, will Amazon want to test their UAS\u2019s in the USA before they are satisfied with their tests in the UK? They were only testing 2 customer locations, so if they take this approach, then we will be waiting a while before they test in the US."], [26375, "2017-03-14T11:16:32Z", [1.0], ""], [34334, "2017-03-13T20:07:05Z", [0.92], ""], [28414, "2017-03-13T09:41:07Z", [0.38], ""], [30396, "2017-03-13T00:36:56Z", [0.8], ""], [34221, "2017-03-11T18:59:57Z", [0.61], ""], [691, "2017-03-11T14:07:42Z", [0.69], ""], [31317, "2017-03-11T04:27:50Z", [0.65], ""], [34291, "2017-03-10T22:38:54Z", [0.85], ""], [4634, "2017-03-10T19:22:37Z", [0.35], ""], [3363, "2017-03-10T01:02:06Z", [0.25], ""], [29054, "2017-03-10T00:59:29Z", [0.82], "Amazon will get the waiver if the FAA gets staffed!\n"], [691, "2017-03-09T14:34:37Z", [0.69], ""], [98, "2017-03-09T01:37:07Z", [0.9], ""], [12591, "2017-03-08T22:34:30Z", [0.7], ""], [691, "2017-03-08T21:01:20Z", [0.69], ""], [33304, "2017-03-08T18:42:18Z", [0.75], ""], [1333, "2017-03-08T17:19:46Z", [0.85], ""], [32539, "2017-03-07T23:04:28Z", [0.53], ""], [34221, "2017-03-07T22:00:01Z", [0.65], ""], [167, "2017-03-07T16:58:51Z", [0.39], ""], [1333, "2017-03-07T15:39:56Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2017-03-06T13:15:57Z", [0.69], ""], [16554, "2017-03-06T01:20:24Z", [0.75], ""], [29970, "2017-03-05T21:40:22Z", [0.01], ""], [8523, "2017-03-05T21:09:40Z", [0.2], "The first drone use approval will help taken longer."], [22343, "2017-03-05T14:01:47Z", [0.48], ""], [33156, "2017-03-05T13:40:34Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-03-04T11:58:20Z", [0.69], ""], [691, "2017-03-04T03:06:33Z", [0.69], ""], [16009, "2017-03-02T22:02:54Z", [0.35], ""], [28091, "2017-03-02T00:26:36Z", [0.65], ""], [15762, "2017-03-01T18:53:26Z", [0.7], ""], [34037, "2017-02-28T16:57:57Z", [0.25], "There is significant potential benefit associated with unmanned systems, and the FAA already allows similar unmanned vehicles for hobbyists, so it seems likely that authorization will happen eventually.

The FAA is behind granting waivers to anyone for any reason because of the extremely rapid growth in requests; even search and rescue operations are waiting 90 days.  The technology is advancing so rapidly, any ruling on how to manage automation will already be inadequate in a year.  Plus, it may take a year of study to make a ruling on waivers for automated drones.  The Europeans have already developed and tested automated drone delivery; we know this works, but to do this on a commercial scale is hugely complex and costly. While the technology is well-developed, this isn't the hindrance.  It's airspace design and limitations, especially in urban areas, where drone delivery makes a lot of sense.  Corridors have been established, but because of use by general aviation aircraft and the separation distances they follow, drones could make these more dangerous. Rural airspace is not nearly so crowded or restricted, but distance becomes the problem. The very best batteries last at most an hour.  Depending on the weight of the delivery, this could be less.  That means a distant recipient would need to have a fresh battery on hand to replace in the drone for a return trip.  So if there's a rural drone \"post office\" where an employee handles this safely (and doesn't steal the drone), this is a cost to Amazon.  There are so many complexities to managing this. I could list many other challenges that the FAA would need to consider to assess the ramifications of a commercial drone operation.  People don't consider how much stuff is up there at typical drone altitudes: communications towers and their guy wires, power lines, birds, helicopters (which are allowed to fly at low altitudes most likely used by drones)...
