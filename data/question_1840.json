Given EIA forecasts overall electricity consumption growth in 2021, then renewables are likely to grow as well.  Correlation with GDP: Q2 with -31% and Q3 with +33%, which correlates with renewable energy consumption growth (negative in March, April, May; positive in June, July, August). GDP forecasts [3] and [4] present all the various scenarios and factors going forward, so it is highly uncertain, but hopefully by Q2 2021 the economy and country is recovering with roll-out of the vaccine and warmer weather.
