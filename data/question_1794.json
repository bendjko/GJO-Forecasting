So, I forecast a near certainty that a resolution will be adopted, and will be done so before May 1st. Also space is an area of competition between the US and China. China tends to use the space issue to support their narrative  of \"respect for the legitimate interests and values of nations, regardless of their social systems or their levels of development\". China uses space as a wedge issue to paint US space superiority as militarized and exclusive. Thus, I think it is very likely China would use the UN, as they have in the past, to support their narrative and vote for a resolution as an alternative to US efforts.

Previous discussion indicates they'll judge this question by the first resolution voted on. I'd guess the first two topics either don't involve votes or China would vote in favor. Another possibility that could lead to China voting against is if the security council addressed a space issue first and China voted against or abstained. I'd guess that has a low likelihood.

I would assume that if multiple space-related resolutions are passed and China votes yes on any of them that this question would be satisfied.

Following the link to agenda item 101 of the 74th session (2019) of the General Assembly recommended by Econja2018, here's my understanding of the situation (this now represents an extreme Inside View, vice my original Outside View): Every year for the past 39 years, there's been an agenda item on \"Prevention of an arms race in outer space.\"   And it looks like every year the General Assembly votes to repeat the same issue on the following year's General Assembly agenda.  So for example in December 2019 the General Assembly voted to place \"Prevention of an arms race in outer space\" on the 2020 GA agenda.   So even though this is not a resolution on something substantive or some geopolitical action to take, it still counts for the purposes of this forecasting question- it is a \"UN General Assembly vote on a resolution concerning outer space.\"  And if these votes typically occur sometime around December, then this year's vote would happen well before May 1, 2021.  According to the 2019 resolution text, apparently China has consistently expressed an interest in matters regarding prevention of placement of weapons in outer space and preventing threat or use of force in space, so I would imagine that China would vote in the 2020 GA in favor of keeping having prevention of an arms race in space on the 2021 GA agenda.
