I think the conservative framing of this makes it look pretty bad. In my opinion the description below has some factual errors, but I can see conservative justices being sympathetic to this point of view. I believe the errors are that CSS believes it couldn't provide referrals because the laws require each agency to address the suitability of applicants. The city also didn't tell CSS how to interpret Catholic teaching, that's a pretty extreme framing of the facts, but again I can see a conservative court being sympathetic to a religious organization being shut out of foster care due to city requirements. \"The case involves Catholic Social Services of Philadelphia, which pioneered care for orphans and foster care in the city. It\u2019s been doing that work for more than a century, and today it partners with foster parents like Sharonell Fulton to care for children. But in 2018, city officials began using their monopoly power over foster care to exclude CSS and foster parents like Fulton from taking in more foster children. City officials took this step because CSS cannot provide written \u201chome study\u201d endorsements for same-sex couples, but instead does something commonly done for secular reasons: provide a referral to help a family find the right agency for them. Even though no same-sex couple ever requested an endorsement from CSS, the city stopped placing children with any of the agency\u2019s families, told CSS how it ought to interpret Catholic teaching and changed its rules to prohibit CSS from continuing to work with the city.\" From here: https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/08/symposium-amid-polarization-and-chaos-the-court-charts-a-path-toward-peaceful-pluralism/"], [31275, "2020-10-26T18:18:24Z", [0.77], ""], [1333, "2020-10-25T13:52:57Z", [0.65], ""], [84880, "2020-10-19T16:31:10Z", [0.69], ""], [691, "2020-10-19T15:29:46Z", [0.76], "There are those who dare to suggest that recipients of public benefits, whether cash payments or licenses to operate, should obey the law or find other work.

But of course I'm not a lawyer so who knows. One possibility i could see is that the laws regulating the foster care system essentially prohibit CSS from doing private foster care, they have to work with the city. And so by prohibiting discrimination against same-sex couples the city is prohibiting CSS from foster care entirely. I think that's a potential angle the court conservatives could take. As others have noted SCOTUS more commonly reverses cases it picks up, otherwise it may not have picked them up in the first place. On the one hand I feel like there aren't many holes for SCOTUS to poke in the case, but on the other hand most cases get reversed, conservatives have a majority on the court, and I'm not a lawyer so I'm sure I'm missing angles that could favor ruling against the city. Balancing that out I think 60% is a decent number.

Starting with the current 8 justices one only has to look to the Hobby Lobby Decision as a good barometer to predict this outcome Thomas, Alito, and Roberts all voted in the majority.  Also remember, Gorsuch penned the lower court's opinion which was ultimately affirmed and recognized 1st amendment rights to corporations; therefore it is not a huge leap to assume that he will side against the City in favor of CSS.  [1]  Given their very recent comments about Obergefell v. Hodges., It can be presumed that Alito and Thomas will maintain their positions and vote in favor of CSS. [2]  Kavanaugh will likely join Alito and Thomas just as he did when dissenting against the denial of the injunction in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak et al over Covid-19 restrictions on religious institutions.   This leaves us a 4-4 decision.   Considering oral argument isn't scheduled until November 4 we can presume that it is unlikely that the decision will be handed down prior to Barrett's confirmation.[4]  Therefore knowing basically nothing about Barrett except that she is a Republican nominee we can only assume she will side with the four conservative justices making a 5-4 decision.
