Sharp one month spikes of over 100 however are often followed by dips of around 10%. A 10% dip would put us back under 1.6M starts. However, the trend is overall upwards. Demand remains incredibly high and mortgage remain stable and low so far (https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates). Dips after spikes have been shallower when the trend has been upward. However, lumber supply remains severely limited and houses permitted but not started is trending sharply upward, so we may be bouncing around our maximum starts capacity as is, while the abundance of demand is resulting in permits for constructions that won't be started until materials prices ease a bit.  The buckets are a bit unfortunate here since my prediction would be centered a little under 1.6, since a 10% dip would put us at 1.565. Dips are smaller when the trend is upward (8% would be 1.6), but I lean a bit toward the normal 10% dip due to supply issues and the idea that we're probably near max capacity, or that any further growth won't be at the same rapid pace as recent trends.

Two dips in a row is worrying considering the historical FRED data but not damning. One concern is a spike in mortgage rates if banks continue to be scared about inflation, leading to a decrease in demand (to the extent that it's currently driven by low interest rates), and raising capital costs for the very capital-intensive process of home-building, both of which may lead homebuilders to not start projects they otherwise would have. The Fed has been clear that it isn't worried about inflation but the market has disagreed, the Core PCE Price Index Data coming out this Friday will be pretty significant on that front. Rates are still at historic lows, but what a change in interest rates means for the future is what I'll be watching. The second concern is lumber prices which have continued to rise. It's not the sort of thing you can easily swap out in the building process, like you can't use the same permit for a building with a concrete frame instead of a wood one (in my understanding) so that shouldn't be something that can be worked around. It's added an estimated $24k in cost to an average new home, and median home prices were $340k, so it's a ~7% increase, meanwhile existing home sale prices have gone up by more that double that percentage (about 16%), so it's a negative but not a crippling one. Lastly, part of the supply crunch that has driven prices so high has been people not listing homes during the pandemic, which may or may not ease in the coming weeks in the US depending on whether we decide to be dumb and how the vaccine rollout goes. But housing starts have a longer time horizon, and builders may recognize that they've run out of time to start and complete projects to take advantage of the high prices from lack of inventory (but that's pure speculation).  Overall though, it's hard to see the past two months' declines as a new trend, considering builder confidence remains super high, permits are still very high (despite a February dip), and projects authorized but not started remain flat as well. The numbers we're predicting are seasonally adjusted but don't account for the exceptionally harsh winter we just had in many parts of the country, so the dip may simply be from weather.  Another kinda stupid possibility is that it's because February is a shorter month so there's fewer days to start construction. It's 8% shorter than the average month and January is longer, and if you adjust for that difference there's basically no change. April will be a shorter month though since its only 30 days, so that's also a slight bump to the lower volume buckets.

As I had pointed out in [1], the crowd had been overenthusiastic about the top bucket (it was 90% at one point), so it's good to see people coming back down to earth. Always make sure you are forecasting, and not nowcasting! (I.e. extrapolating recent trends in too simple a manner.) There have been news pieces about how the Feb decrease is due to cold weather, and therefore we'll see an increase as it warms up in Mar-Apr, but, does anyone really know? The cold weather was there, yes, and HOUST went down, but that is not sufficient to establish causality, as everyone on GJOpen knows. My mental model is that building a house is a vastly complicated endeavor depending on dozens of factors, so it is hard or impossible to blame any single factor. Another consideration is that the cold weather may have lingering effects. I think I read that a housing unit counts as started when they first start digging the hole for the foundations. Well, whatever precedes the digging (leveling the plot of land? clearing it?), probably also less of that was done due to the cold weather. So we would still see fewer housing starts down the line even when it warms up. Also, remember that the FRED numbers are *seasonally adjusted*. That means that March-April don't have to be colder than February for HOUST to be low. They just have to have worse weather than the *average March-April* (to an extent that impedes construction). With all this in sight, I am moving almost all mass to the top 3 buckets, but I will remain somewhat agnostic about which will come true.

Since October 2020, this number has been 1554, 1635, 1704, and 1886 (measured in thousands of units).  Clearly, builders are applying for permits to build new houses.   Taken in order of what a builder needs to start a new house, which is the ultimate question we're being asked to forecast.   1) Land to build on (somewhat constrained right now based on various news articles)\n2) A permit (discussed above, rising fast)\n3) Material to build the house (rising lumber costs, houses cost more, fewer people may buy houses, causing homebuilders to slow-building if they don't have buyers.  Or they just reduce their profit margin.)\n4) Workers to build the house Somewhere in there is a customer to sell the home to.  Many companies will build new homes without a contracted purchaser.  Customers can come in at any point in the build process, so that isn't too important. So this really comes down to a competition between the rising cost of houses and builders' profit margins.  Permits are continuing to filed, so builders want to build houses.  I also think as mortgage rates start to rise, people are going to want to jump on the historic lows.

I attempted to quickly look at the trends in the housing starts compared to other periods when interests rates were low using this chart (https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/us-interest-rates/), but had trouble coming to any significant conclusion since there were few examples where housing starts went up during a recession and none of them involved a pandemic.

In this case, there are three statistics that revolve around housing starts.  1) Building permits for new homes 2) Housing Starts 3) Housing Completions In December 2020, those numbers were 1,709,000 / 1,669,000  / and 1,417,000 respectively.  In this instance, we are talking about the actual housing starts. Doing some more base rate analysis with information provided by The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, privately-owned housing starts in December 2020 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,669,000. This is 5.8 percent (\u00b111.0 percent) above the revised November estimate of 1,578,000 for December 2020 and is 5.2 percent (\u00b110.1 percent) above the December 2019 rate of 1,587,000.  The 1.669 million number is consistent with what the St Louis Federal Reserve provides for December as well.  There is also a great graph that provides historical data going back 60 years!  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST Using the graph provided by the FRED, new housing starts hit rock bottom in March 2009, which was the height of the Great Recession.  Since that time, housing starts have consistently risen, but it has not yet hit the all-time highs of January 2006. Looking back over the last 50 years, it seems like the median number (half the months above, half the months below is about 1.5 million.  Therefore, I think much more weight should be given above 1.4 million.  That is the OUTSIDE view.   Next, let's look at the unique instances of this case. Interests rates are historically low and I belive the FED will probably keep its benchmark less than 0.5%.  Lending will continue to be cheap.  Second, new home starts traditionally rise in the spring.  Weather conditions allow home construction to advance across the country.  Third. employment should continue to rise as the COVID vaccine gets rolled out.  Therefore, people will have jobs to back those loans.  As the number of available homes remains low, house prices will go up.  This will spark supply by builders, who think they have the opportunity to make money.  More houses will be made available by builders to take advantage of these high prices.  Another reason for the robust market is that Millennials are finally putting their money into homeownership. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the homeownership rate for 25-to-34-year-olds rose to 40.7% by the end of last year.  This is significant because Millennials, the generation of people in their mid-20s to late-30s, currently surpasses Baby Boomers as the nation\u2019s largest living adult generation. As the remaining percentage of this group starts investing in homes in the near future, demand will persist.  All of these factors indicate that the housing market is poised to remain strong as we head into the new year. And as Jonathan Woloshin, head of U.S. real estate at UBS Global Wealth Management, believes, they could \u201cbuoy the housing market for years to come.\u201d Why might housing starts decline?  As COVID cases drop, maybe people will move back to the city and fill all those empty apartments and condos that are already built.  Maybe all the qualified candidates for new homes will already have loans and contracts, leaving people who are unable to obtain loans as the only candidates for new construction.  It's possible the new construction houses could be above their price point. With all that considered, my initial hunch is to go with 63% as more than 1.6 million, 32% between  1.4 million and 1.6 million, and just 5% with 1.2-1.4 million.  But before I make my forecast, let's check the wisdom of the crowd.... The current crowd consensus is 53%, 46%, and 1% for those same categories.  Given that, I'll adjust ever so slightly to get closer to those numbers. I also took a look at the comments provided by others and the only thing I found that didn't consider was the cost of labor and supplies (thanks to @MCJNDU).  I don't see that changing much through April.  A major forest fire could cause timber prices to rise, and trade wars could cause steel to rise (girders, etc), but both of those seem unlikely.\n "], [40584, "2021-01-31T22:13:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25], ""], [88452, "2021-01-31T20:01:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.44, 0.56], ""], [81495, "2021-01-31T19:23:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.15, 0.83], ""], [97593, "2021-01-31T17:16:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.87, 0.13], "Base Rate:  Using regression analysis of the last 10 years of FRED housing start data, we should expect April 2021 housing starts to be 1,497,756.  From Excel, the formula for new housing starts is: Y= 6.6816X + 655.87 Where Y is monthly new housing starts and X is the number of months since January 2011 (for April 2021, X = 126).  Inside View Adjustments:  Industry analysts suggests new housing starts depend on many variables, three of the most significant are demographics, interest rates, and general health of the economy.  However, examination of each variable suggests negligible impact on the base rate.  Demographics: I don\u2019t see any reason to adjust the base rate for demographic shifts occurring in the next four months. Anecdotal evidence suggests the COIVD pandemic has encouraged mass migration out of urban centers, which would cause a spike in new housing starts.  However, empirical research does not support this assertion (reference Forbes article below). Interest Rates:  Interest rates are unlikely to change in the next four months.  On 27 January 2021, the FED announced its intention to keep the Federal Funds Rate at its current target of 0% to 0.25%.  The FED Chairman stated he \u201cwanted to see substantial further progress toward our [economic] goals before we modify our asset purchase guidance.\u201d General Economic Health:  Independent of interest rates, general economic health is a significant variable affecting new housing starts.  Key indicators like new unemployment insurance applications and GDP growth suggest the partial economic recovery that occurred between August 2020 and December 2020 is slowing down.  While new housing starts rose significantly above average from August to December, the recent economic slow-down will likely return this rate closer to average growth.  This trend actually re-enforces movement back to the base rate of 1.49M.\n  https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2020/12/01/are-people-really-moving-out-of-cities-due-to-the-pandemic/?sh=1c0997aa6279\n"], [97459, "2021-01-31T15:37:07Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.13, 0.46, 0.4], "Main driver is low interest rates. I do not foresee a significant change in rates before April. \nHousing starts in Dec 2020 were rate of 1,338,000 and in Nov 1,195,000. Supply of existing home in December was at record low, causing new home starts to increase. Building permits, a strong indicator of new starts, in December 2020 were 17.3 percent higher than in Dec 2019. This all points to strong April new starts. I also do not believe we will see a near-term housing bubble burst. 2008 housing bubble is not a good comparison to today's conditions.

We're at 1.55M in Nov 2020. So we should skew higher than the average. I don't understand why the crowd is giving the top bucket only 1%. I don't understand interest rates 100% but here is my best guess. Low interest rates means it's cheaper for builders to borrow money to build. It also means that builders will capture more of the final home price than before. Roughly speaking, people have a fixed budget, say $1M, to buy a house. (It amounts to the same if we phrase that as a max monthly payment.) With high interest rates, that money could go $500k towards the actual house, and $500k towards interest. But with low interest rates, the split could be $900k house, $100k interest. Therefore, builders are incentivized to build more, both on the input side (cheaper capital) and on the output side (more profits). As builders realize this, I expect more building to get done in the near term. Still, I don't know anything about houses or building them, so I won't deviate from the historical average too much.

Seasonal adjustment procedures for monthly time series estimate effects that occur in the same calendar month with similar magnitude and direction from year to year. In series whose seasonal effects come primarily from weather (rather than from, say, Christmas sales or economic activity tied to the school year or the travel season), the seasonal factors are ***estimates of average weather effects for each month, for example, the average January decrease in new home construction in the Northeastern region of the U.S. due to cold and storms***. Seasonal adjustment does not account for abnormal weather conditions or for year-to-year changes in weather. It is important to note that seasonal factors are estimates based on present and past experience and that future data may show a different pattern of seasonal factors.\" Q 13: \"What is an annual rate? Why are seasonally adjusted data often shown as annual rates?\"\n\" Very generally, what we call the seasonally adjusted annual rate for an individual month (quarter) is an estimate of what the annual total would be if non-seasonal conditions were the same all year. This 'rate' is not a rate in a technical sense but is a ***level estimate***.\" Q16: \"What is an indirect adjustment?  Why is it used? If an aggregate time series is a sum (or other composite) of component series that are seasonally adjusted, then the sum of the adjusted component series provides a seasonal adjustment of the aggregate series that is called the indirect adjustment. This adjustment is usually different from the direct adjustment that is obtained by applying the seasonal adjustment program to the aggregate (or composite) series. When the component series have quite distinct seasonal patterns and have adjustments of good quality, indirect seasonal adjustment is usually of better quality. Indirect seasonal adjustments are preferred by many data users because they are consistent with the adjustments of the component series.\nExample: United States Total Housing Starts United States = Northeast Region + Midwest Region + South Region + West Region Because seasonal patterns are different in the different regions of the country, we can estimate the seasonality better by adjusting at the regional level and summing the results to obtain the seasonal adjustment for the U.S. total.\" (Regional components: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=27&eid=20911#snid=20913)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170113192428/http://www.census.gov/const/www/faq2.html United States Census Bureau is frequently doing seasonal adjustments and reports Seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR):\n\" The SAAR is calculated by dividing the unadjusted month rate for the month by its seasonality factor and multiplying by 12 to create an annual rate.\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonally_adjusted_annual_rate\nhttps://www.economy.com/support/blog/buffet.aspx?did=B202381E-BADD-4AC0-923A-6451642D2489\nhttps://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411seas.htm The US Census Bureau has for this purpose developed and upgraded its own model, X13ARIMA-SEAT and even provides an open software under that name that lets you do the adjustments yourself for monthly and quarterly figures (previous versions also mentioned often: Census X-11 (until the late 1990's), and X-12-ARIMA (probably until at least 2017), which has even been used by e.g. the German Bundesbank:\nhttps://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/614626/3c8a098287c8594859cafe6f0662828d/mL/1999-09-census-data.pdf).\nhttps://www.census.gov/srd/www/winx13/ The Dallas FED has also commented on seasonally adjusted data:\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/seasonally.aspx\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/twostep.aspx The goal is to separate (\"decompose\") the seasonal component from the trend, cyclical and error components, and adjust by neutralizing seasonality.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series#Decomposition_based_on_rates_of_change\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonality#Calculation For the X-12-ARIMA model, there is an example process and adjustment algorithm  shown here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_adjustment#Seasonal_adjustment From the reference manual, the point \"Irregular-component Regression Models\" (pp.229) sounds promising, I will take a closer look at \"C.2.2   Pseudo-Additive Decompositions\", p. 234. https://www.census.gov/ts/x12a/v03/x12adocV03.pdf When it comes to the HOUST data, the seasonal adjustment seems problematic , as mentioned before, for this time frame, since one of the goals, smoothing the data over time, is not fulfilled:\n2020-01-01 1617 / *1316.0\n2020-02-01 1567 / *1347.6\n2020-03-01 1269 / *1353.9\n2020-04-01 934 / *1322.2\n2020-05-01 1038 / *1299.2\n2020-06-01 1265 / *1302.9\n2020-07-01 1492 / *1327.8\n2020-08-01 1416 / *1334.1\n*own calculation (non-seasonal adjusted annual rate) Monthly \n2020-01-01 113.1\n2020-02-01 111.6\n2020-03-01 104.5\n2020-04-01 84.9\n2020-05-01 95.1\n2020-06-01 118.8\n2020-07-01 139.1\n2020-08-01 127.3 Apparently what the adjustment has found as seasonal component (repeatedly lower output during winter months of previous year), and would also have been expected for 2020, did not occur this way this winter due to other random factors, such as the backlog of building permits, and the level of federal funds rate and the timing of the FED's rate cuts, it would have been better put into the irregular/error component of the time series. However, one good the SAAR does: it amplifies the monthly deviations from seasonal patterns of previous years and thus exposes, what could be the beginning of a trend break towards a different trend level, as mentioned before.

Unlike the COVID recession which was on the rise, housing starts were down 16% from the previous year starting two quarters prior to each recession.  On the flipside, housing starts were up 16% in the four quarters following a recession.   I agree that natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes are going to increase new demand.  Low mortgage rates will also drive demand.  However, it took 3-4 weeks to hit the same number of unemployment over an average of 52 weeks from the previous five recessions.  Unemployment and contracted GDP will have an impact. \nAlso, COVID is likely to drive an increase in Single-Family homes over multi-family structures such as apartment buildings that can increase the number of housing starts.

Seasonal adjustment appears to be a big problem, as the most recent data in (HOUST) shows big jumps, probably due to the fact that the seasonality inherent to the data does not fit to the actual \"additional\" seasonality imposed by the pandemic and in its wake the almost nation-wide lock down between March and May; obviously there were numerous permits that could not be transferred into housing contruction (\"Housing Starts\"). Housing permits used to be higher than actual monthly housing starts by up to 10%, until the recession began in November 2019 and December 2019, which may be the result of uncertainty about the future long-term interest rates, and the FED's future course. Obviously, the risk premium in real estate loans was considered \"too high\" for most of 2019, so that a significant backlog with real estates development permitted but not started yet built up. Probably market participants were aware of the possibility of lower interest rates and avoided financing their projects at higher financing cost. Now that federal funding (interest) rates are as low as they will probably go, and are set to remain low for a long time, the above mentioned backlog in permits is financed and finally constructed, which leads to significantly higher actual monthly \"Housing Starts\" from June to August 2020 (the September figures due in early October, I expect,  will be strong, could also be around 135,000 starts, so the annual figures could end up around 1434 (HOUST)/*1352).\n* := (actual annual starts, not seasonally adjusted, calculated as the sum of the twelve most recent months, e.g. October 2019 to September 2020 for the upcoming value, see table below). 2019-04-01   1267 / *1225.8\n2019-05-01   1268 / *1220.2\n2019-06-01   1235 / *1223.3\n2019-07-01   1212 / *1225.6\n2019-08-01   1377 / *1232.8\n2019-09-01   1274 / *1236.3\n2019-10-01   1340 / *1245.4\n2019-11-01   1371 / *1257.6\n2019-12-01   1587 / *1289.9\n2020-01-01   1617 / *1316.0\n2020-02-01   1567 / *1347.6\n2020-03-01   1269 / *1353.9\n2020-04-01    934 / *1322.2\n2020-05-01   1038 / *1299.2\n2020-06-01   1265 / *1302.9\n2020-07-01   1492 / *1327.8\n2020-08-01   1416 / *1334.1\n*own calculation\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/data/HOUST.txt In the light of this, it is perfectly comprehensible that POTUS already throughout 2019 attacked the FED for raising their federal funding rate and persistently demanded lower interest rates, as the FED's course endangered the economics of the building & construction sector for private homes, and thus the success of \"his\" economic policy and the soundness of the housing market. However, it is discomforting to see that housing construction requires ever larger monetary stimulus to reach the same output level: as it has almost become insensitive to monetary stimulus (the market may be by and large saturated at the moment), this spells problems, and maybe even a real crisis on the housing market in the medium term.\nLooking again at \nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST\nit is clear that there was a clear trend breach already in January 2006: prior business cycles saw an overall flat trend of annual housing starts of 1,400,000 to 1,600,000 p.a.; in the run-up to the \"Great Recession\" these levels were undershot in July 2007 (1,354,000) for the first time, and fell as low as 478,000 in April 2009.\nTrend after January 2008 appears to lie lower, at 1.1mn to 1.2mn housing starts annually for the next ten years. It now seems that, due to political impulse and very advantageous business (i.e.financing) conditions, housing start return to their long-term trend-level, despite all pandemic obstacles: with regards to housing starts (actual annual, not seasonally adjusted, own calculation), the pandemic effect appears to have lowered annual starts temporarily by up to 40,000 units versus trend growth, and was overcome in July 2020 already. Rolling forward these, it appears set they will surpass 1.4mn units before April 2020, barring the political chaos around November 3rd elections and its impact on business climate and expectations. However, there is one caveat: as we are obliged to forecast seasonally adjusted figures for April 2021, the adjustment being made (and probably causing wild jumps next spring again), makes it somewhat unpredictable, until one knows exactly how the St. Louis FED does the adjustments to the raw data (I'll try to find out...). However, since two major natural disasters hit the U.S. this year with above average destruction (wildfires at the West coast, active hurricane season at the Gulf coast (Texas, Louisiana)) and at least 40,000 to 50,000 \"structures\" (at least that I heard of) were either burned or blown away, there will probably be an increased demand of re-construction in these areas and thus a five-digit number of additional housing starts from this effect alone before April 2021. In addition, from the figures of between January 2019 and August 2020, there's a stock of roughly 96,300 housing permits (PERMITNSA) (2,302,100 permits in total) that probably have not yet transmitted into construction starts (HOUSTNSA) (2,204,800 housing starts) and that may push next year's figures at some point, once construction has begun (if there's a complete catch-up and none of the developments will be abandoned). My best guess for the final outcome: (HOUST) April 2021, published May 2021: 1,435"], [1333, "2020-10-09T13:14:58Z", [0.05, 0.27, 0.63, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [80634, "2020-10-09T13:07:57Z", [0.02, 0.15, 0.7, 0.1, 0.03], ""], [40584, "2020-10-08T23:49:45Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.38, 0.18, 0.04], ""], [84880, "2020-10-08T23:17:40Z", [0.01, 0.45, 0.51, 0.02, 0.01], ""], [95707, "2020-10-08T20:54:30Z", [0.05, 0.7, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-10-08T20:32:36Z", [0.05, 0.26, 0.64, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [95790, "2020-10-08T20:27:40Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.7, 0.15, 0.1], "I tried to think of math-y ways to come up with an outside view for the base rate, but got frustrated. \nPart of my problem is that I'm confused by the fact that the FRED graph seems to be measuring units in \"thousands\" but the figures given above are given in the millions.  \nI decided for now to count the info about wildfires and lumber industry and mortgage rates as \"noise,\" and try to find a base rate.\nI looked at the FRED graph for housing starts for the period of 2010-Aug 2020.  The interesting thing was that there's a clear visual pattern:  every year, the line goes up and down in clumps of spikes (wish I could paste in a screenshot but can't).   But in addition to that the overall trend is that the number of housing starts goes gradually up, year on year. \n\nSo even though the housing starts \"crashed\" in April 2020 relative to the rest of 2020 so far, the April 2020 housing starts are higher than, say, anytime in 2011-2012.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to be a hedgehog here and allow my biases to impact my prediction. I am very bearish on the economy. It's just a question of timing.  Interest rates will remain at zero. No doubt. The market will continue to be heavily juiced. By the end of the year I expect the Federal Reserve to do another round of quantitative easing buying up more mortgage-backed securities. But I think we are going to see a lot of foreclosures in the commercial real estate market and I think real estate prices in the big cities are declining, which is where the high value properties are, which will hurt bank's balance sheets.  As long as a borrower has clear verifiable income I think there will be financing there because of the low interest rates and the Federal Reserve purchases, but I think with their difficult balance sheets I think banks will be skeptical to loan on any mortgage where the borrower's income is in question. we are going to see some temporary employment over the Christmas season, but I expect a second round of layoffs to happen and another stock market crash, possibly triggered by the election. before 2008 it was more common for developers to develop a bunch of homes and then try to sell them. After the 2008 housing crisis developers typically now only build homes when they have a buyer already in place.  For what it's worth, I'm a real estate appraiser. we've been extremely busy, especially with refinances, ever since interest rates dropped. I think we might have seen a surge of people who suddenly decided to buy because of low interest rates, but I think that is a temporary boost. longer term the market evens out. Lower interest rates means higher real estate prices. Higher interest rates means lower real estate prices. In the end, the buyer ends up with about the same monthly payment. So longer term, low interest rates don't mean a sustained increase in purchases. April 2020 we definitely saw a lot of projects that were delayed due to Covid, so I think it is better to look at historical numbers prior to 2020.
