There would seem to be no reason to do this now. If there was to be a second referendum it would be more likely to be called at the point when it becomes clear that Brexit as described my Mrs May will not be possible (e.g.Mrs May has described Brexit as being outside the Single Market and Customs Union, not under the ECJ, no significant annual payments, with no Freedom of Movement, but with no physical border between NI and Eire, and no different between NI and the rest of the UK, and with a friction less free trade trade deal with the EU (equivalence but not identical standards) which at the same time allows the UK to strike free trade deal with 3rd countries - otherwise known as \"having your Brexit cake and eating it\"). If (when?) it become clear that this deal will not happen some way out of will be needed. There are three possibilities; the government will decide, parliament will decide or a new referendum will have to be held. I think the most likely outcome will be for parliament to decide. For the government to decide would require it to admit that it had been misleading everyone by suggesting that the Mrs version was ever possible. Having another referendum would risk getting the \"wrong answer\" (e.g. the public voting for an outcome that the government and parliament does not want). So my view is that the most likely outcome would be to \"allow\" MPs to have a vote on the Brexit outcome so MP can be blamed for the outcome not being what anyone actually wanted.

The poll, published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, found 50 percent of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain\u2019s exit deal, 34 percent rejected another referendum and 16 percent said they did not know. The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week\u2019s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help to move on to talks on a future trade pact with the EU.
