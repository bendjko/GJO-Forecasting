Figure actual cases ~4 * 2.76M = ~11M = ~38%.\nTo date, ~22.3% of Texas population has received at least one dose of vaccine.\nSo ~50% have some immunity (expected overlap between vaccinated and previously infected); ballpark 60% may have ~90% immunity by end of April, some small percentage with only one dose vaccine.\nFew cases last April.\nNicer weather in April than in summer; many people may be outside.\nBut, Texas is completely \"open.\" It's been open for 12 days.\nAnd B.1.1.7 is likely to become the dominant strain in Texas by the end of March (https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/uk-variant-set-to-become-dominant-variant-in-texas-us-by-end-of-march), although the vaccines are largely effective against B.1.1.7.\nCurrently, curve (cases/day) is almost flat and at ~4k cases/day. \nBased on fall rise, average cases/day not likely to rise to more than ~6.5k cases/day, although greater levels are possible with B.1.1.7.\nTo have 150k cases in 30 days: 5k cases/day average.\n250k: 8.3k cases/day\n350k: 11.7k cases/day\nSo: if cases stay relatively flat, then April will have <150k cases.\nIf cases start to increase a bit, April will have 150k to 250k cases.\nCases would have to increase massively to have 250k to 350k cases.

Based on other graphs I've seen, I'd say it's closer to 0.9.

That wouldn't be too hard; greater drops and rises happened last summer and early fall.\nSo, it's a tough call, but I think given B.1.1.7's contagiousness and Texas' openness, a bit of an uptick in cases can be anticipated primarily among the unvaccinated and those who haven't had Covid yet, as has been seen in other countries earlier."], [98210, "2021-03-24T00:22:50Z", [0.84, 0.1, 0.06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [89038, "2021-03-23T22:36:21Z", [0.87, 0.1, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [98177, "2021-03-23T21:25:59Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [87827, "2021-03-23T20:24:00Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2021-03-23T20:07:12Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [98258, "2021-03-23T19:58:59Z", [0.77, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-03-23T19:41:06Z", [0.78, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [50395, "2021-03-23T15:33:34Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [98183, "2021-03-23T13:04:23Z", [0.8, 0.18, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-03-23T11:03:52Z", [0.85, 0.11, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34959, "2021-03-23T03:39:00Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [49359, "2021-03-23T00:17:36Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "The trend is downward.

This question wouldn't need to be asked had there been strict adherence to and adoption of mask wearing and social distancing promoted by senior government officials from the outset.  Vaccination rates are improving across the board; however, there is a multi-week lag between receiving the first dose and second dose and a subsequent two week lag before the second dose max efficacy is achieved.  Variant B.1.1.7 (U.K.) infections are currently being confirmed as an increasing percentage of new infections and have been detected in over 50% of Houston area wastewater treatment samples as of early February.  Although the rate of new infections is trending downward Texas appears to be preemptively seizing defeat from the jaws of victory by removing restrictions on public health and safety measures before the virus has truly been stamped out from circulating populations.  While infections may rise before ultimately falling to near zero once the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated, fatalities should continue to decline as once overburdened healthcare facilities and beleaguered front line health care workers are more effectively able to treat seriously ill COVID patients following the winter surge. If the majority of Texans had already received their second dose as of today it would be reasonable to conclude that April would bring fewer than 150K new confirmed and probable cases and likely even fewer than 50,000.  Putting the burden of \"personal responsibility\" on a populace who is already tired and ready to move on from COVID restrictions hoping to return to a more \"normal\" pre-COVID lifestyle is detrimental to public health and safety.  As the data shows from other significantly smaller countries with greater population density than most US states (e.g. Taiwan, Vietnam) adherence to simple things like mask wearing drastically curtails the transmission of COVID-19.  Consider population density and geography relative to the U.S. four most populous states CA, TX, FL, NY respectively. Estimated population 2020 / Land in sq. miles (2010) / Population density per sq mile (2010)\nCA:  39.4M / 155,779 sq mi / 239.1 p/sm\nTX:  29.4M / 261,231 sq mi / 96.3 p/sm\nFL:   21.7M / 53,624 sq mi / 350.6 p/sm\nNY:  19.3M / 47,126 sq mi / 411.2 p/sm Number of confirmed COVID-19 infections / infections per 1,000,000 / infections % total population \nCA:  3.6M total infections / 91,412 / 9.13% infection rate among all Californians\nTX:  2.71M total infections / 93,507 / 9.22% infection rate among all Texans\nFL:  1.98M total infections / 91,145 / 9.12% infection rate among all Floridians\nNY:  1.72M total infections / 88,439 / 8.91% infection rate among all New Yorkers Texas though the least densely populated of the top 4 states has the highest rate of infection per million at 93,507 and the highest percentage rate of infection among its residents (9.22%).  NY with greater than 4X the population density of TX trails with 88,439 infections per million and a 8.91% infection rate among its residents.  Draw what conclusions you will from this loose association of data but based on this info alone it would appear that Texans are going out of their way to infect one another by rejecting public health and safety measures. If we were to look at the same data regarding the top two most infections States by number of infections per 1,000,000 residents (North Dakota and South Dakota) it becomes even more glaringly obvious that masks and social distancing measures improve public health and help curtail the transmission of COVID.

I don't expect Texas's change in policy to have a negative effect. As one of many examples, just compare Florida to California. California is one of the states that is  youngest as far as median age, and they have very strict lockdown measures. Florida is one of the oldest states in terms of median age and has had a very open policy. There is some mask wearing, but all businesses are open and tourism is high. Disney world is open in Florida but Disneyland in California is closed. Based on the fact that this virus has literally a 1000 fold greater effect on older people, you would expect that Florida would have literally 100 times the cases but they are about the same as California.  I believe the drop since December has mostly been the result of the virus following the flu season trend, and also a result of the CDC's policy change in December regarding PCR testing. they stated they do not recommend PCR tests above about 32 cycles, which I think eliminated a lot of the false positives. Before December we probably had 20% to 40% of cases which were false positives because of high PCR cycling. World renowned epidemiologists are also stating that the reason we have so many flu cases is that most of our flu cases are being diagnosed as covid, which is another reason to think this will tend to follow the flu season curve.
