SC has a reinfection rate of 1.03, and as of yesterday has 92.4 per 100k new infections.  I estimate (guess) a 50/50 chance for SC to be above 75 on March 1. NY, TX and KY are all a bit below the 75 level. But they have reinfection rates close to 1, with TX is slightly above 1.00.  A fairly small change could put TX, KY or NY above the 75 threshold. VA has the highest reinfection rate, 1.08, and is very close to the 75 level.  If the reinfection rate is correct, and if it continues, then VA will meet the criteria.  NH is also below 75, but has a reinfection rate of 1.02.   If Rt changes rapidly, or if it turns out to actually be higher than current estimates, then other states could also reach the 75 threshold.  According the projections at https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/, new infections on Feb 22 (one week before the end of the question) will be down by about a third from the levels of Jan 22. The ongoing vaccination campaign should bias the numbers downward, but the more transmissive mutation could bias the numbers upward.  The CDC estimates that the B.1.1.7 will become the dominant virus sometime in March.  Since this question ends on March 1, I will underweight the possibility that the mutation will have a major effect before March 1. \"The modeled trajectory of this variant in the U.S. exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March.\"  See https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm. With 37 days remaining there is still considerable uncertainty.

This would suggest putting most of the probability on zero or 1--3 states having >= 75 daily new cases. However, there will be more testing on March 1st than during most of the pandemic. Also, as of December 26th, it is likely that more people are actually sick (whether tested or not) than during earlier stages of the pandemic, and this will likely not have completely changed in two months. Visual inspection of the graphs of active cases suggest that the descent after a maximum is much slower than the ascent to the maximum. Hence, it is likely that there are more cases and more positive test cases on March 1st than during most of the pandemic. More contagious strains could further increase the number of cases. Thus, we adjust the estimate to putting most of the probability mass on 4--6 (50%) and still a considerable probability on 7--9 (35%). There are a few factors that will exercise a downward pressure on new cases: more people will have had the virus already. Some people will be vaccinated by mid-February. Officials estimate that there will be doses for about 100 million people being available by the end of February.[1] Not all of those doses will be administered by then, so I estimate about 60 million people (~1/5th of the population) to be vaccinated by the end of February. I naively assume that this will reduce cases by about 1/5th relative what they would have been without vaccines. This means we shift some fraction of the probability we currently put on 7 and 9 down to 4 and 6, and so on.
