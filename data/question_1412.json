While many believe that there is a 0% chance that the government will reform, I believe that it is possible that the government makes changes to the current system. Though I am in disbelief that the Chilean government nationalizes large amounts of assets to fix this issue as the government has said that there is no room in the state's finances to support a public pension. Looking outside of Chile, Argentina (also had a similar system) has reformed its system though many people find the same change improbable in Chile- a mixed solution to the private system is a more reasonable solution, but the Chilean government has not made substantial reform since 2008. Those who vote a higher percentage of possible change due to the protests in Chile may think that the government will react positively to the protests- the government has largely acted with force. While 4% may be high for the topic I think that it is much more reasonable given potential outcomes and analysis of historical and present information.  sources: \nhttps://www.americasquarterly.org/content/solving-chiles-crisis-starts-fixing-its-pension-system https://www.ipe.com/chile-chilean-pensions-under-pressure/10018671.article https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2019/12/21/1978658/protests-chile-and-governments-response https://doc-research.org/2018/02/chile-pensions-2/"], [66692, "2020-02-04T18:05:26Z", [0.0], ""], [84735, "2020-02-04T14:20:53Z", [0.04], ""], [79697, "2020-02-03T17:39:20Z", [0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-02-02T20:55:56Z", [0.01], ""], [84658, "2020-01-30T22:32:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-01-30T14:20:27Z", [0.14], ""], [37379, "2020-01-29T17:35:14Z", [0.15], ""], [1333, "2020-01-29T11:33:12Z", [0.15], ""], [57778, "2020-01-28T01:43:17Z", [0.04], ""], [1333, "2020-01-27T11:54:08Z", [0.16], ""], [691, "2020-01-24T15:17:41Z", [0.01], ""], [32300, "2020-01-23T15:03:31Z", [0.05], ""], [84385, "2020-01-22T20:17:03Z", [0.1], "Just too big a step at this time."], [62992, "2020-01-20T08:07:46Z", [0.0], "Pinera and his group does indeed lead Chile in the exact way for at least two decades, they would not really understand the need for change disregarding conditions / despite anything that could happen in Chilean society!"], [83566, "2020-01-19T22:04:24Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2020-01-19T20:27:51Z", [0.01], ""], [82988, "2020-01-19T19:13:14Z", [0.45], ""], [81896, "2020-01-19T16:48:30Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2020-01-19T13:41:37Z", [0.17], ""], [68386, "2020-01-18T19:33:48Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-01-17T17:08:47Z", [0.18], ""], [67246, "2020-01-15T08:47:17Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2020-01-14T21:40:14Z", [0.01], ""], [78328, "2020-01-14T01:36:39Z", [0.03], ""], [578, "2020-01-13T19:27:19Z", [0.0], "The key phrases in this question is \"nationalizing private pension fund assets\" and \"compelling the divestiture or transfer of privately held pension funds to a public entity or the state\".

It is difficult to see this happen in a center-right government.   While there are talks of having \"employers to pick up the tab for an additional 4 percent contribution to each of their workers\u00b4 pension funds, to be phased in and managed by an administrator of the employee\u00b4s choosing\" (1), they do not constitute nationalization. A more drastic change could happen if there is a change in the government controlled by left leaning parties.  But presidential and parliamentary elections won't be held until November 21, 2021.  Therefore there is little chance that nationalization of pension funds by July 1 2020 or 2021.
