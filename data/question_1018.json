By far, the biggest threat to civilian safety the past few years has been the militant Islamist movement Boko Haram. This group does target civilians through suicide bombings and other attacks, but the group's power has declined after significant efforts on the part of the Nigerian military and other countries in the region. In 2017, the group killed more than 300 people, but nothing suggests that these killings were systematic or in a single campaign. Although the military itself does have high levels of corruption and extrajudicial killings, and other armed groups are active, it is unlikely that any single group would be motivated or able to commit systematic killings on such a large scale.
