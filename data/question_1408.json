This would be more interesting data point to know than deaths. Some unreported disease.

They traditionally relied on donations from international organizations, however, due to the greater than average losses of rhinos over the last two years, they have taken decisive action.  Three issues dominate the population size: poaching, natural disasters, and the carrying capacity of the areas where the rhinos live. Poaching has all but been halted by government agencies around Chitwan National Park, which hosted 605 of Nepal's 645 rhinos. Natural disasters relate mostly to monsoon related flooding that drowns the rhinos because their normal habitat runs along rivers. The rivers are where the saccharum spontaneum grass that comprises 80% of their diet is. The grass is being replaced by an invasive woody plant the rhinos can't eat, at a rate of 2%/yr. The other issue is the grass is used by the local population to thatch roofs and as domestic animal fodder. This additional loss has accelerated the invasive species' growth. Both have been identified as an issue, however, little has been done to mitigate the invasive plant's progress to date. In 2016 the carrying capacity of Chitwan NP was estimated to be 800 animals, therefore a reduction of 2% habitat a year would equate to the loss of 8% of habitat, or a carrying capacity of 736 animals by 2019. All growth rate calculations resulted in population numbers above the estimated carrying capacity. Therefore it can be assumed the animal's population growth is now pressing on the upper limit of the park's carrying capacity. This could partially explain the higher than average natural death rate in the last couple of years, in addition to flood losses. There was little data for the animals residing outside of the park, therefore estimates are based on the data related to the park and extended to those animals outside the park. My estimate is a population of 685 to 736 rhinos. https://www.thetrickyscribe.com/chitwan-national-park-the-death-zone-for-rhinos/\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989417300938"], [29054, "2019-12-27T23:07:50Z", [0.26, 0.49, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [63786, "2019-12-27T21:10:52Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.35, 0.42, 0.08], "If the growth rate from the last two census are anything to go by we would be looking at a population of 750+.

This makes me think they are not expecting an embarrassing decline or will artificially boost the figures to satisfy political ends.\n- The spike in Rhino fatalities may be down to the Chitwan Park reaching its natural Rhino population limit.

That number has since shot up: From 2015 to 2017, 60 such deaths were recorded, an average of 20 per year.\"[3] Let's assume that poaching is low single digits over the period. Census numbers from previous years: 2000: 544\n2005: 372\n2011: 534\n2015: 645 [4,5] Between 2005 to 2015, the annual growth rate was ~27. For 1978 to 2000, the rhino population went from 310 to 612, or an annual growth rate of ~14.[6] Then, we have this statement: \"...Ram Chandra Kandel, a deputy director general at the department. says he fears a decline in the total number of rhinos in Nepal. 'Dozens of the rhinos were swept away from Chitwan to India during the 2017 floods. The disaster had a long-term impact on the wildlife,' he says, 'So I am not much hopeful.'...There were 645 rhinos in Nepal in 2015. Of them, more than 600 were in Chitwan.\"[7] Flooding, a harsher environment, possibly population aging is probably both increasing the death rate and lowering the growth rate closer to the earlier average of ~14. The deputy director is expecting a decline. But, will it be reduced by ~10 per year to get below 601, given what we know of the growth and death rates? It seems unlikely.  An increase seems even less likely, given the flooding in 2017. Putting a bit more of a hedge to below the middle option than above (with both below default) and more or less discounting the top and bottom ends.

How many rhinos can we assume to have died based on the information we have on the reasons for fatalities in the past? @Kitsonj and @cerdinga have already discussed most of these questions. It depends to a large degree on the rhinos' fertility (50 babies/year? [1]) and the survival rate of calves and those juveniles that cannot survive on their own (11.1% death rate? [2]).

So all in all, I'm a little bit reluctant regarding the numbers of the rhinos. I'm not particularly sure about the influence poaching has on the population on average [6]. In general, I assume that the Nepal government will pull off the census and its publication in time, mostly due to the buzz the government has made about it [7,8].

This would take the 645 counted in 2015 down to 537, before rhino births and not accounting for unreported deaths + deaths this year. (1) The 2017 floods in the Chitwan national park which swept away 15 rhinos (2) did affect the habitat of the rhinos which remained, which could have contributed to the increase in rhino deaths that year. Another hypothesis is that the increased death rate in the past few years has been due to older rhinos dying of natural causes, (3) as well as more rhinos competing over territory. I have not been able to substantiate the claim that 50 rhinos a year are born (4). I will look to see if this is accurate, but if it is off even by 20% then that would be 200 rhinos born, pushing the figure from 537 to 700+. However, some of the rhinos will migrate, calves may die in childbirth, etc. There are a few things that could otherwise influence the outcome - the census is postponed again, the numbers could be exaggerated for political reasons, the census could be poorly conducted and miss/overestimate. Dropping most in the +650 bracket as if the birth rate is accurate then this will easily push the figure about the 645 recorded in 2015. The previous census had 111 new rhinos from 2011-15, a 21% increase.(5) 1. https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/rhino-census-likely-from-mid-february-till-mid-may/\n2. https://news.mongabay.com/2017/09/india-and-nepal-team-up-to-rescue-flooded-rhinos/\n3. https://news.mongabay.com/2018/10/whats-killing-nepals-rhinos/\n4. same as 1 \n5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rhinoceros"], [1333, "2019-12-02T20:16:42Z", [0.1, 0.11, 0.4, 0.25, 0.14], ""], [75093, "2019-12-02T17:02:16Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.35, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [691, "2019-12-02T14:39:37Z", [0.08, 0.17, 0.38, 0.25, 0.12], "Trying to round up somebody who knows about this since I don't know anybody in the Nepalese government any more.

Best possible scenario would be an increase of around 170. Worst possible would be a modest decrease. These are very tentative numbers. (Perhaps the overall surviving births number has been brought down by lower reproduction rates or higher calf mortality rates than the historic averages, arising from e.g. pressure on resources, adverse weather conditions etc. However it's hard to see the outcome being much better than the best case scenario as birth rates are subject to biological constraints...)\nNext question: if anything less than the best case scenario is the result of the census, would the government allow its publication given they have announced a doubling in population over the last decade? I find this even harder to predict than rhino population rates. Given the scale of the exercise it seems like it would be difficult but not impossible to find a pretext to suppress publication. However, it might be easier simply to publish and to point to a factor like the 2017 floods to explain a disappointing outcome. \n"], [39381, "2019-11-30T09:10:59Z", [0.37, 0.63, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [72737, "2019-11-29T23:15:23Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [33887, "2019-11-29T20:53:21Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-29T20:47:50Z", [0.12, 0.12, 0.36, 0.28, 0.12], ""], [1333, "2019-11-29T18:44:02Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.15], ""]], "open_date": "2019-11-29T18:00:05Z", "close_date": "2020-07-01T06:59:05Z"}
