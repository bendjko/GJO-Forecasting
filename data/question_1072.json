The Rabaa massacre was another potential, but the frequency of systemic killings is quite low, despite the large number of civilian deaths in war zones.  It seems that the Taleban is growing stronger in Afghanistan, and as such may want to carry out fewer attacks against civilians to boost its legitimacy. However, non state forces regularly target election campaigns with attacks (to lower turnout to lower the legitimacy of the elections) and the presidential election is due to be held on 20th July (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/12/afghan-presidential-elections-postponed-july-20-official-181230185336213.html). Attacks against polling stations are likely, with 300 in the 2018 election, but many of these were low in the number of people killed - the attacks would have to be very effective in order to get up to the 1000 threshold, and as far as I know this would be the first example of this happening in Afghanistan. Furthermore, this presidential election keeps getting postponed.
