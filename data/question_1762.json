The presidency noted that many member states are already at an advanced stage of preparation of their plans and recalled that European-wide recovery will benefit from the swift implementation of the RRF. The Commission highlighted areas where further progress is needed and underlined the need for full alignment between the draft national plans and the RRF regulation.\"\nhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/ecofin/2021/03/16/ It proves that the Own Resource Decision is high on the list of priorities, and there's frequent exchange on top government level.

The presidency will provide an overview of the state of play. Ministers will also discuss the priorities of the recovery and resilience plans following their exchange of views on the plans in January and February. The regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility entered into force on 19 February. This means that member states can now officially submit their recovery and resilience plans to the Commission, once they are ready. They have until 30 April, as a rule, to do this. Once a plan has been submitted, the Commission will generally have up to two months to assess it. After that, the Council will have four weeks to adopt its decision on the final approval the plan. After the plans have been approved, the Commission will sign grant and loan agreements with the member states, commit resources and proceed with the payment of the pre-financing (13% of total grants and loans) within two months. However, such resources can be committed only if the own resources decision will have been ratified in the meantime.\" If plans will have been submitted by 30 April and\nthe European Commission has two months (until 30 June) for assessment/final approval,\nand the Council has four weeks (28 July 2021) for adoption,\nit seems a ratification until 30 June will suffice in order to avoid frictions in the European Commission operational procedure \"with the payment of the pre-financing (13% of total grants and loans)\" by law:\n\"However, such resources can be committed only if the own resources decision will have been ratified in the meantime.\"\nThis takes quite some pressure and urgency from the ratification process, however, parliaments (or whoever is competent by member state constitutions) will target a ratification asap before 30 June 2021, thus apparently there's no official target or hard deadline. \nhttps://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/48815/210316_ecofinvtc_draft_background_note_for_the_press.pdf @samglover97"], [98277, "2021-03-18T19:28:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Only 7/27 have ratified NGEU at this point in time.

That begs the question; will Netherlands have a government in place, with relevant ministers etc in place, to approve the own resources decision by 31 March? I am having my doubts. The Netherlands is, after all, one of the frugal four that  objected to the ORD funding of the RRF and we have no idea what sort of government will be voted into office.  Other than Netherlands, the basics of ORD are in place. See https://bit.ly/3qlCRbm / https://bit.ly/3sRRrJp / https://bit.ly/3kPYCyQ. I am not aware of any other countries, either Frugal Four or otherwise, whose parliaments are unlikely to approve the ORD. Thus, on the whole, the approval should be a  foregone conclusion.

The Netherlands' (part of the 'frugal four') general election (17 March 2021) and the government formation process could prove a crucial breaking point in ratification, and I have not yet found out whether the Netherlands have already ratified it. If so, a full ratification prior to April appears pretty viable. If it's too delicate for a caretaker government to ratify such a controversial piece of legislation (controversial to the country), it will likely not happen before the 11th hour of late March, once a government will have been formed at that point in time.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_EU\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en\nhttps://twitter.com/vonderleyen?lang=en\nhttps://twitter.com/hashtag/NextGenerationEU\nhttps://euobserver.com/economic/150860\nhttps://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Europe/Articles/2021-02-12-review-2020-german-council-presidency.html\nhttps://www.marketscreener.com/news/latest/The-initial-fiscal-policy-responses-of-euro-area-countries-to-the-COVID-19-crisis--32387548/\nhttps://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/02/12/reactie-van-de-minister-van-financien-beantwoording-schriftelijk-overleg-eurogroep-en-ecofinraad-van-15-en-16-februari-2021/reactie-van-de-minister-van-financien-beantwoording-schriftelijk-overleg-eurogroep-en-ecofinraad-van-15-en-16-februari-2021.pdf EDIT:\nAccording to a government document, as of 10 February 2021,\nhttps://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/02/10/nota-naar-aanleiding-van-het-verslag-goedkeuringswet-eigenmiddelenbesluit/nota-naar-aanleiding-van-het-verslag-goedkeuringswet-eigenmiddelenbesluit.pdf\nit appears that\n/ the Netherlands have not yet ratified NGEU\n/that the government of Netherlands will hand the decision to its parliament, as soon as a \"trilog\" negotiation platform had come to an agreement concerning the exact properties of the  Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), and\n/that it could be the baltic states (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) who could potentially delay their parliamentary ratification over the \"Connecting Europe\" Facility (CEF) and their \"Rail Baltica\" project.\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Baltica"], [691, "2021-02-10T16:34:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.99, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2021-02-10T14:46:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], ""], [62808, "2021-02-10T01:04:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], ""], [86554, "2021-02-08T16:46:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], ""], [1333, "2021-02-07T15:34:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.96, 0.04], ""], [1333, "2021-02-02T15:21:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], ""], [73970, "2021-02-02T14:10:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.87, 0.13], ""], [1333, "2021-02-01T21:00:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.02], ""], [62808, "2021-02-01T19:38:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.97, 0.03], ""], [62808, "2021-02-01T19:05:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [88452, "2021-02-01T00:45:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Here's a funny thing called \"legislative train\", which reminds me of the internet of 1998.\nThat's how time is spent in the European Parliament - fully immersive graphic novels.\nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-an-economy-that-works-for-people/file-mff-post-2020-own-resources/12-2020 Final sentence:\n\"On 14 December 2020, the Council adopted the new Own Resources Decision.

Hungary has declared victory saying it has achieved what it wanted regarding the rule of law conditionality regarding  NGEU Covid-19 recovery fund distributions. Poland is a little less effusive but appears to be broadly in agreement. This is all in preparation for tomorrow's EU Council and Summit meeting.  See https://reut.rs/3n82Ke4 Considering that the EU Parliament and the national states have to agree the MFF (budget), the mechanics of the process, even if verbally agreed tomorrow, will see this taking place in the new year.  As stated in the question;  \"The question would resolve upon the last Member State approving the amendment. When the amended Own Resources Decision would take effect is immaterial.\" Thus, I am assuming this means that the parliament of the last national state to approve the MFF in its parliament will resolve the question. The amendment referred to is the increase in GNI from 1.4% to 2% for the period of the MFF and is integral to the current MFF debate.

However, it's certainly not a done deal; see https://reut.rs/2LfRazn. Obviously Germany would like to end their presidency with an agreed 2021-2027 MFF and thereby enable progress to be made on the pandemic recovery funding. Portugal, the country to hold the next Presidency after this week's summit, does not have the weight or economic clout that Merkel and Germany hold. That may be the hope for Poland and Hungary. Nonetheless, as is clear in the above referenced article, Poland and Hungary have consistently stated that clarity on the rule of law conditionality must be 'clear' . This may be one of the complications of governing in a multi-language environment. Will a mini-summit take place this week? 5% probability in my view. Will the EU Parliament still vote before 31 December? < 5% in my view. Hence, no change to my current forecast. As at 20201207 Poland and Hungary say they will not remove their threat of a veto if the rule of law conditionality is maintained in the proposed EU recovery package. See https://reut.rs/2JCKRWq. However, there has been 'talk' that the EU could sideline Poland and Hungary and continue with the MFF / ORD on the basis of the 25 other countries, i.e. excluding Poland and Hungary, using the 'enhanced cooperation' process which could still ensure the recovery funds being distributed to countries from the \u20ac750bn recovery package by mid-2021.  Assuming the enhanced cooperation process is used, with Christmas looming and all EU countries focussed on the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the probability of this process being completed in the next 3-4 weeks is zero.

Hungary and Poland vetoed the ORD proposal before the EU Council; see https://reut.rs/3f2BOZY albeit the Covid recovery package was approved in principle on the basis of the qualified majority. However, as the Covid-19 recovery package is legally part of the 2021-2027 ORD, without unanimous approval, the MFF / ORD cannot go forward and hence the Covid recovery package also cannot move forward. Hungary and Poland have made it quite clear they will veto any proposal in which adherence to the rule of law clause will be required in order to obtain recovery funds. Parliament and Commission will now have to consider amendments to the clause wording as it is clear that the use of the qualified majority voting has not succeeded in approving the MFF / ORD. In the light of this, no change to my forecast. Updated 20201110 Further to below, in principle the EU Parliament and the EU Council has agreed the outline for the 2021-2027 MFF (budget) and the ORD. See https://reut.rs/38r1ka5 and https://bit.ly/2JYLQjz. Formal agreement must still be ratified and individual governments of the EU must ratify this through their respective Parliaments. Hungary and Poland are still potentially likely to vote against the proposed MMF simply because of the 'rule of law' condition attached to the MMF. That is in spite of the qualified majority process now being part of the ratification process for the implementation of any 'rule of law' sanctions. See https://politi.co/2GTNotM and  https://politi.co/35o9EoW.  As at 20201106: Further to my previous rationales, 7 Sept, 8-28 Oct, the EU Council and EU Parliament have reached an agreement on the mechanism about how to enforce the 'Rule of Law' provisions and the sanctioning of governments considered to be in beach of EU values.  This element of ORD and the next 7 year budget was a sticking point simply because Poland and Hungary threatened to veto the budget based on this provision. The Council has now proposed that the sanction mechanism as 2 stages and can be implement by a 'qualified majority vote' rather than the previous unanimous agreement. See https://bit.ly/2IfBdaT and https://bit.ly/3euHEmI (see 'Functioning of the Mechanism) The next step is Parliament's approval. As this was negotiated between the Council and Parliament, it is unlikely Parliament will reject the proposal. Thus, in all likelihood, Parliaments approval is likely within the next few weeks. The relevant Parliament Committee will discuss the issue on 9 Nov 2020. The urgency of the situation has been again pressed by Council.

Additional funds have been approved by EU Council to restore some of the previously cut programs as mentioned below; see https://bit.ly/3mwmWFP. However, the issue of rule of law condition the parliament is insisting on is not making much headway. See https://bit.ly/3mwmWFP. The next round of informal negotiations on this topic will begin tomorrow, 20201029. This element of the budget is likely to be the stickiest as all sovereign parliaments have to approve ORD and it's conditions. Poland and Hungary have said they will not approve this condition. Thus more horse trading is likely and that is likely to prolong the process of approval of ORD Updated 20201015 The EU Parliament's President, Sassoli, has requested further funds from the Council and heads of state for additional funds, \u20ac37bn, in an attempt to progress talks on the ORD. See https://reut.rs/3lPSwy2. However, it seems this has met with a chilly reception.  \u20ac37bn is a relatively small sum which may bring the Parliament 'on side' and make it more motivated to approve the next 7 year ORD. However, this is only one of the issues the Parliament has raised as topics to be resolved for a final vote to proceed. The most likely sticking point is the application of the 'rule of law' condition Parliament is insisting on (see below) and which Poland and Hungary are likely to reject. Updated 20201011 MEPs walked out of discussions with EU Council for a week thus delaying potential agreement further - https://bit.ly/36SVXzz The process to ensure the activation of the ORD, once agreed by the European Parliament, must still be approved by each to the 27 parliaments of each country.  Updated and amended 20201008 Germany, currently the Chair of the EU Council, has intimated additional funds in an effort to break the impasse in the EU Parliament on the process of approving the next 7 year budget which includes the EUR750bn Covid recovery package. See https://on.ft.com/3dcyFpn & https://bit.ly/3jLbyoo. Two procedural issues are clear; a) the heads of each government have to approve the budget plan and b) the budget plan has to be approved by the Parliament. In the case of a) Hungary and Poland are unlikely to agree the 'rule of law' condition the Parliament is insisting on. As for b) the German Ambassador to the EU has attempted to change the direction of debate on this topic by advising that the rule of law conditions should only be applicable to matters directly pertaining to the budget and not broad rule of law matters like justice, human rights etc. The Parliament is unlikely to accept that at this stage. It is also doubtful at this stage if Hungary and Poland would accept this different interpretation of the rule of law condition.
