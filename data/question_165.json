Based only on the history of these two I would be doubtful of having something concrete in a short time, nevertheless according to NIH experts Zika is very well understood (meaning vaccine progress is positive) due to the extensive studies of previous flavivirus. \nFinally, I am basing most of my forecast on the tentative vaccine timeline found in this video below (jump to minute 41)\nhttps://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?bhjs=0&File=19561&bhcp=1 Any suggestions?"], [24283, "2016-04-24T09:49:49Z", [0.05, 0.65, 0.3], ""], [368, "2016-04-23T21:22:33Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [532, "2016-04-23T19:43:20Z", [0.88, 0.11, 0.01], ""], [691, "2016-04-23T13:24:18Z", [0.75, 0.24, 0.01], ""], [368, "2016-04-22T19:58:49Z", [0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [24122, "2016-04-22T15:10:52Z", [0.59, 0.4, 0.01], ""], [691, "2016-04-22T13:26:38Z", [0.76, 0.23, 0.01], ""], [102, "2016-04-22T03:23:58Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/22/gitrep-21apr16pm/"], [691, "2016-04-22T01:59:21Z", [0.76, 0.23, 0.01], ""], [19170, "2016-04-21T23:58:26Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [73, "2016-04-21T03:49:37Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [102, "2016-04-21T03:47:41Z", [0.82, 0.14, 0.04], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/gitrep-20apr16pm/"], [691, "2016-04-20T22:27:16Z", [0.76, 0.23, 0.01], ""], [368, "2016-04-20T22:15:23Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [4694, "2016-04-20T15:42:44Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.2], ""], [15621, "2016-04-20T08:38:05Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0], "See @dkc\nhttps://morningconsult.com/alert/zika/\n"], [10192, "2016-04-20T08:01:04Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-04-20T02:25:42Z", [0.77, 0.22, 0.01], ""], [1646, "2016-04-20T00:36:16Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [556, "2016-04-20T00:01:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "https://morningconsult.com/alert/zika/"], [368, "2016-04-19T20:17:02Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [8605, "2016-04-19T17:52:35Z", [0.59, 0.16, 0.25], ""], [24048, "2016-04-19T08:28:40Z", [0.55, 0.25, 0.2], ""], [7445, "2016-04-18T22:57:12Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [24052, "2016-04-18T22:22:33Z", [0.17, 0.63, 0.2], ""], [368, "2016-04-18T22:21:04Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-04-18T20:06:01Z", [0.77, 0.22, 0.01], ""], [12874, "2016-04-18T19:22:34Z", [0.87, 0.11, 0.02], ""], [38, "2016-04-18T18:41:26Z", [0.89, 0.11, 0.0], "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/16/the-race-to-cure-the-zika-virus-is-on-and-this-com.aspx \" . . . if you want to count the number of possible Zika players, you'll need to use both hands. 1) \"Inovio Pharmaceuticals  . .  and GeneOne Life Science announced a partnership back in January to test a DNA-based vaccine to treat the Zika virus. Considering that both companies have solid backgrounds in DNA-based vaccine development, they may be able to bring a candidate to human clinical trials by the second half of this year. 2) \"NewLink Genetics. . . . Perhaps best known for its cancer immunotherapy development platform, NewLink has experience in developing vaccines for flaviviruses, and its partnership with Merck (which has the deep pockets) should allow a potential cure to be funneled into clinical trials, assuming it shows promise in preclinical studies.  3) \"Drug giant Sanofi\u00a0. . . In early March it announced that it had assembled a team of 80 in-house experts to accelerate the research and development of a vaccine. Sanofi developed the first regulatory-approved vaccine for dengue, a similar mosquito-borne illness, which it believes could help expedite research and development of a Zika virus cure. Similar to Inovio, Sanofi could be in clinical trials by the second half of this year if all goes well. 4)\" . . . In January, GlaxoSmithKline announced that it was weighing the development of a Zika virus vaccine considering its prior research into dengue. As the two infectious diseases are similar, GSK may be able to lop years off the development process for a vaccine. 5) \". . . Cerus. . .  isn't directly involved in curing the Zika virus, but does have its novel and Food and Drug Administration-approved Intercept Blood System. Cerus' Intercept Blood System can be used to proactively combat transfusion-based transmission. Keep in mind that this works well beyond just Zika, but it's an important step to possibly ensuring the disease isn't spread through blood transfusions. HOWEVER, \" . . .  the best solution might just belong to Intrexon,. . .  which has taken a unique approach to combatting the Zika virus. Last summer, Interxon acquired Oxitec, a company involved in biologic insect controls. . . .  Oxitec genetically modified male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, allowing these mosquitoes to pass along a genetic mutation to the next generation of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This new genetic insertion kills the new generation of mosquitoes before they reach the reproductive adult stage. In simpler terms, Oxitec developed a method to dramatically reduce/control the aedes aegypti mosquito population. Efficacy tests in Brazil, Panama, and the Cayman Islands demonstrated a 92% to 99% reduction in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population, which may also translate into a substantial reduction or elimination of other serious mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue. . . . in March the FDA announced that it found Intrexon's genetically engineered male mosquitoes to be environmentally safe, which is another big hurdle cleared. \"The big question is whether affected countries will opt for Intrexon's perceived-to-be ready solution or not. Intrexon is counting on plentiful government contracts to drive its Zika virus program growth. Some Wall Street analysts view combating Zika as a $200 million to $400 million annual opportunity for Intrexon. However, coordinated containment efforts by the World Health Organization and other health agencies often stamp out infectious diseases before they have an opportunity to reach pandemic potential. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  After describing 5 different teams working on a zika vaccine, several of which may have a vaccine ready for clinical trial in a few months, this piece suggests that zika research money may go into biological control instead.  hm."], [6303, "2016-04-18T18:38:12Z", [0.8, 0.15, 0.05], "Sandofi is closest to starting a clinical human trials on a Zika Virus vaccine based on their Dengue Fever Virus vaccine as reported on CNBC today."], [24046, "2016-04-18T18:22:38Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [21691, "2016-04-18T15:48:13Z", [0.35, 0.4, 0.25], ""], [21614, "2016-04-18T12:45:31Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.35], ""], [22814, "2016-04-18T12:21:01Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2], ""], [21180, "2016-04-18T04:40:05Z", [0.2, 0.75, 0.05], "More cases on Western civilization must be seen before this moves to profit model and risk evaluation.

Zika-linked Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) [a disease which causes paralysis that is sometimes fatal but more often reversible] is stoking concerns that a vaccine designed to protect patients against Zika could inadvertently provoke more cases of the autoimmune condition. . . . \u201cUnderstanding the cause of GBS is going to be very important for vaccine development.\u201d The logic behind these concerns is relatively straightforward: If exposure to that virus can fuel GBS\u2014by some estimates in as many as one in 5,000 cases\u2014might the presence of a weakened or dead form of virus within the vaccine provoke GBS cases, too? Like a flu or polio vaccine, a shot designed to protect against Zika would need to contain some form of the virus in order to stimulate antibody protection against it. . . . \u201cThere will be a risk. . . .  says Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Yet, \u201cthe risk of not having a vaccine overwhelms the risk of GBS,\u201d he says. . . . At issue is what level of risk is acceptable.  . . .  analysis of past French Polynesian Zika patients . . .  suggests that exposure to Zika exacerbates the baseline GBS threat some 20-fold. Fauci and others, however, say they are not yet convinced that The Lancet figure (one in 5,000 Zika patients) is the final word. An estimated four out of five patients with Zika virus are asymptomatic. So if scientists track such asymptomatic individuals for GBS, perhaps that statistic could change\u2014likely dropping the chances of how often Zika-linked GBS occurs, they contend. More studies need to be conducted. \"But scientists are also racing against the threat of an evolving pandemic. The first stage of clinical trials for at least one potential vaccine candidate is slated to begin in September, according to Fauci.  There are no plans to push that timeline back, he says. . . . .\n. . . \n\"At the heart of the consternation about vaccines is why GBS appears to be tied to Zika in the first place.  . . . From a vaccine-development perspective, it would be particularly troubling if  [the virus itself directly attacks neural cells and destabilizes the myelin sheath around them or damages axons] . . . .because it is hard to control immune response\u2014especially when scientists are not sure what facet of the virus may set off that cascade of action. Unfortunately, preliminary data suggests that this feared immune response is exactly what is happening, . . . . \"Scientists are also looking to past GBS studies to devise plans about how to sidestep this potential threat. One idea: if GBS is caused by an immune response from the body, perhaps using a killed virus vaccine could allay this issue. But even then there are no guarantees. \u201cThe question is, does part of the virus look like human proteins or peptides that generate the autoimmune reaction?\u201d . . .  If that is the case, then perhaps the presence of those substances would still cause GBS . . . It\u2019s too early to say,\u201d agrees Monath, chief scientific and chief operating officer for the Infectious Disease division of NewLink Genetics, a biopharmaceutical firm. \". . .  analysis of GBS suggests the incidence of Zika increases by about 20 percent with every 10-year increase in age . . . so testing any vaccine on younger patients\u2014say people in their 20s instead of their 40s\u2014would be one safety precaution.  \"For Pedro Vasconcelos, director of the National Reference Laboratory for Arboviruses in Brazil at the Evandro Chagas Institute, there is no time to lose. Even concerns about GBS, a condition treatable with pricey therapies including plasma exchange or injections of immunoglobulins, cannot push back vaccine trials. \u201cWe need to do better work still, but we need to move forward,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery day with Zika is a new surprise.\u201d\n"], [19170, "2016-04-17T15:36:05Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [23997, "2016-04-17T15:32:05Z", [0.07, 0.28, 0.65], ""], [23988, "2016-04-17T11:09:24Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2016-04-17T05:53:18Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [691, "2016-04-16T20:00:05Z", [0.77, 0.22, 0.01], ""], [22983, "2016-04-16T19:40:45Z", [0.74, 0.21, 0.05], ""], [22983, "2016-04-16T19:28:45Z", [0.72, 0.21, 0.07], ""], [14493, "2016-04-16T16:30:07Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.6], "It is reported (Nature) that one type of vaccine could start trials by December (i.e. most probably will not).

They are now recruiting volunteers for their Phase 1 MERS trial.  This example sets the pace for Innovio Zika vaccine development.  Innovio has completed a rat study for its Zika vaccine.  It says it will now do a non-human primate study.  Perhaps this will take a few months.   At that point Innovio should be in a position to apply for an Zika vaccine IND.  If you add it up, everything would have to go perfectly for Innovio to begin a Phase 1 trial before January 1st.  Innovio might make it, but the odds are it won't cross the finish line until 2017.  Protein Sciences, another contender, appears to be trailing Innovio by some additional months.  I expect Protein Sciences to finish third. Where did i go wrong with my initial forecast?   Mainly, I just didn't pay enough attention to the biggest horse in the race -- the NIH.  I expected the NIH to follow a traditional role and be a promoter of Zika vaccine, but not a competitor in its development.  If this big horse steps into the starting gate, it becomes the automatic favorite.  It has huge competitive advantages compared to any private outfit.  It doesn't have to negotiate financing deals with investors or corporate partners.  It can shift money around and apply it quickly with confidence that future appropriations will fill any budget gaps.  Once a public health matter like Zika becomes a political issue, the NIH need have no concern about matters like market size or product profitability,  Additionally, the NIH has unique advantages in the regulatory arena.

There's a lot of hype about Zika, but without IND approval, you can't begin Phase I human testing.  Some of the initiatives are worth a look.  Innovia has announced that it will file an IND for a synthetic ZIKA vaccine that has been tested in rats.  The Innovia collaboration includes Gary Kobinger (Canadian official and expert) and GeneOne Life Sciences (South Korean contractor that owns a plasmid facility in Texas).  Drug developers like to create buzz.  It helps them raise money.  Of course, the disclaimer attached to Innovia's announcement advises that \"clinical trials may not commence or be completed in time frames estimated.\" About six months ago, Innovia made a similar announcement about a MERS vaccine, but I can find no announcement about Innovia MERS IND approval.  Arguably MERS is a more serious disease than Zika.  Maybe the Innovia Zika IND approval process will move along faster.  If not, Innovia's announced plan to start Phase I trials in 2016 \"may not commence in time frames estimated.\" Gary Kobinger was involved in Ebola vaccine development in in the past.  The development partner back then was a company called Defyrus.  The usual press releases appeared in 2011 and 2012.  The IND application wasn't filed until 2-3 years after that and it took a year to gain IND approval so Phase I human testing could begin. The Bahrat intiative in India claims to be ahead of the pack in Zika vaccine development.  What they seem to have is a vaccine candidate ready for pre-clinical trials (animal testing).  That needs to get done before they can even apply for an IND. Protein Sciences claims to be on a fast track for a Zika vaccine but they haven't actually made it yet.  There's no likelihood that it would be ready for human trials in 6-8 weeks.  The company says it might be ready for testing sometime soon.  That would be animal testing, not human testing.  After animal testing,, Protein Sciences would have to go through the IND application process.  Other research groups in Britain and Brazil have made announcements that they will also be launching initiatives to develop Zika vaccines.  It's likely that these are also start-up initiatives. Statements by Anthony Fauci, the pope of infectious diseases and vaccines, don't seem to be encouraging the thought that a Zika vaccine will be ready for human testing in the time frame of this question. Putting all this together, I'm tilting toward the back end of the answer array.  I could be wrong.  Maybe some political initiative will blossom and blow up the IND process.   Maybe someone, somewhere will give some human an experimental Zika vaccine.   It's also possible that the correct answer will be 100% -- not before July 1, 2017.  No pharmaceutical company that wants to sell a global product can avoid the IND process.   Incidentally, it isn't always easy to get any pharmaceutical company to make vaccines.  I think dengue languished in development for 20 years.  Last time I checked, I don't think there were any takers on chickungaya.  Most vaccine buyers are governments.   Most governments want to pay very low unit prices.  Many end customers are poor people in poor countries.
