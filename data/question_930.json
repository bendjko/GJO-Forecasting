At the moment it seems most likely that the UK will remain on, or be re-added to, the list post-Brexit.  Russia has the ability to address domestic shortfalls by fiddling with product exemptions (as it has already done with various fish fry, seeds, supplement, baby food inputs etc) - this allows Russia significant flexibility to chip away at the embargo without needing to remove entire countries from the list.  Various news outlets have reported that the embargo has already been formally extended to the end of 2019 though the European Commission has not (yet) reported this or posted a translation on their website, as they have done with previous extensions.  From the drafting of the original decree (at least per the EC translation) and the fact that the product list can be and has been modified, I assume that Russia is still able to modify the country list as it sees fit even after a formal extension decree has been signed. Reserving a 1% chance of some form of rapprochement with one of the embargoed countries before the end of 2019, leading to its removal from the list. https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-eu-sanctions/russia-extends-ban-on-some-eu-food-imports-until-dec-312019-idUKR4N1U0020\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/international_affairs/eu_russia/russian_import_ban_eu_products_en"], [34725, "2018-10-18T07:05:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-17T19:32:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [691, "2018-10-16T12:29:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [34353, "2018-10-16T11:44:25Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [34725, "2018-10-16T09:03:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [28414, "2018-10-16T08:41:01Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.99], "In September 2018, the improvement in the attitude of the inhabitants of Russia to Western countries, which we celebrated in the spring of 2018, ceased.

The EU which makes up the majority of the countries in the boycott has recently extended sanctions till January 2019 causing instability in an already unstable relationship. It is likely the sanctions will be extended longer causing the boycott to continue its term till 2020, especially as the relationship continues to worsen over the Russian spy poisoning and other current affairs. As for the other countries, they will stay in the boycott because of the (as Moscow stated) \"degree of involvement of these countries in the sanctions regime.\"  In the chance that the EU ends sanctions (see Macron statement on \"EU to have strategic relationship with...Russia that brings stability\"), I have forecasted 20% between 1 and 31 countries being in the boycott because US-Russia relations are so unstable (with sanctions, etc) at the moment that the US will most likely continue to be boycotted against.  Overall, the boycott has been ongoing since 2014. It would take major steps forward for the boycott and sanctions to be removed, and Russia is claiming that the ban has stimulated branches of agroindustry further proving that the ban will most likely stay till at least October 2019.
