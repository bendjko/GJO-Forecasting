As others have mentioned, Turkey has already extended the state of emergency past November. However, there are some reasons why Turkey might not be in a state of Emergency by November 1st. One reason is that there could be another successful coup. In one 30 year period, there was an average of 1 successful coup every 10 years (http://time.com/4408850/turkey-coup-history/). So there is about a 1/36000 chance of a successful coup happening in any given day. There are about 22 days until November 1st, so there is about a 22/36000 chance that there will be a successful coup before then. This probability is probably actually lower because of the state of emergency making it more difficult for there to be a coup. So this is actually insignificant and doesn\u2019t affect my probability judgement. Turkey could also chose to end the state of emergency by themselves, though I think this is also unlikely. Turkey is taking advantage of its state of emergency by doing things that they would be against the law under other circumstances. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/29/to-no-ones-surprise-erdogan-extends-turkeys-state-of-emergency-after-failed-coup/) They have also dimissed critisism from others about these actions without budging on their policy. I think that Turkey is unlikely to end the state of emergency early and lose the power it\u2019s taking advantage of. I still think there is some chance they will do this, about .5%. This number is low because 22 days is a very short timeframe for the government of Turkey to change their mind about this. Another reason the state of emergency could be ended early is because of pressure from the outside. The Council of Europe, which Turkey is part of told Turkey to end this state of emergency. (http://www.aina.org/news/20161008143854.htm) The Council of Europe does have some power since they can enforce agreements like the European Convention on Human rights (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights). The Council of Europe has had infuence on decisions in the past (https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/28/council-of-europe-writ-large). So I think that there is some chance that the Council of Europe will pressure Turkey to end their state of emergency early. I think there is about a 2.5% chance of this. Again, the probability is small partly because 22 days is a very short timeframe. So I think there is about a 3% chance that Turkey will end their state of emergency. I think it is more likely that Turkey will still have a state of emergency in some places then end it completely. As I mentioned, Turkey will probably want to keep their state of emergency, so if they are pressured to reduce this, they will probably still want to keep it in some areas. So I think there is a 2% chance that the state of emergency will only be in some areas, and a 1% chance that it will be ended completely."], [14613, "2016-10-09T21:36:14Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""],

With such a claim, Erdogan will continue to press his clean up tactics w/in the Country. Gulan also indicated, he was prepared to return to Turkey should the U.S. decide to comply with Turkey's Request for Extradition. (2). Erdogan, on the other hand while in NY made his case at the UN, that the US must not harbor a terrorist like Gulen. (3)   Aside from the recent VP Biden visit to Turkey, the U.S. has been quiet on this front.  Whether the U.S. delivers Gulan as rapidly as Erdogan would like, is an open issue.  Additionally, considering the various Syrian/Turkish border attacks recently (4), along with the uncertainty related to Gulan's extradition to Turkey from the U.S., there is a high probability Erdogan will choose continue consolidating his power domestically by extending the State of Emergency for another three months at least.
