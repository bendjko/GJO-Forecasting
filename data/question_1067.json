With the exception of Bihar, it's hard to see where they are materially stronger than last time. And even there, considering they won 31 out of 40 seats, it's likely not to lead to a spike in won seats. Meanwhile, across the Hindi belt, they should face significant challenges, especially in UP, where they're facing a two-way fight from the INC, which is focusing on upper-caste voters, and the BSP-SP which is focusing on Dalits, OBCs and Muslims.  Though their last election looked pretty decisive, with a majority for the BJP alone, that they can only lose 50 seats while still holding onto a majority makes it seem fairly tenuous. Big picture, in retrospect, 2014 was a perfect storm; a popular national leader, with the tailwind of anti-incumbency after the INC won two terms despite not having deep roots, and facing a disorganized opposition, especially in UP. Modi is still popular, but now has to deal with some of the challenges of having an actual record, and the beginnings of a bit of his own anti-incumbency.

Modi will likely remain in power because rather than choosing an entirely religious platform, his campaign platform is one of nationalism. This message unites the some of the ideologically different Hindu populations as Modi is not seen as an ideologue nor does he appear to \"pamper the minorities\" (2). \nThere are, however, still several economic questions that Modi must address. Unemployment in India is rising and the country's youths are moving into cities for  education and job opportunities. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of jobs, so there are more qualified individuals than there are vacancies. \nIn rural parts of India, support for Modi is expected to stay strong because communities have benefited from cheaper cooking gas and electricity, as well as access to toilets and more schools (3). \nAnother sign pointing towards Modi's expected success is the global trend of growing nationalism. While the opposition party in India has some support, the power of that party (called Congress) remains within one family - the Gandhi's. The public has resisted this form of contemporary monarchy (in more countries than just India), and have responded with the election of nationalist leaders, such as Modi. \n1. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/post-pulwama-pm-narendra-modis-ratings-rise-by-7-to-52-poll/articleshow/68350217.cms\n2. https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-sh/Modis_India\n3. https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324025\n"], [71835, "2019-04-14T20:49:05Z", [0.75], "High approval ratings and national popularity, as well as the global trend towards nationalism and anti-muslim sentiment, make the odds high he will get another term.  \n"], [71837, "2019-04-14T19:49:36Z", [0.65], ""], [71811, "2019-04-14T19:40:55Z", [0.5], ""], [71798, "2019-04-14T17:55:56Z", [0.0], "People want change"], [71777, "2019-04-14T16:27:20Z", [0.25], ""], [71688, "2019-04-14T09:38:05Z", [0.5], ""], [19127, "2019-04-14T08:44:15Z", [0.79], ""], [71633, "2019-04-14T05:15:55Z", [0.8], ""], [71629, "2019-04-14T04:45:57Z", [0.88], ""], [71610, "2019-04-14T03:39:06Z", [0.8], "Populism is on the rise"], [71569, "2019-04-14T02:05:10Z", [0.66], ""], [71588, "2019-04-14T01:57:21Z", [0.75], "he seems to have largely done a good job and has considerable popular support"], [71562, "2019-04-14T00:54:02Z", [0.85], "Very likely as he is still widely popular in India."], [68316, "2019-04-14T00:39:31Z", [0.6], ""], [71537, "2019-04-13T23:58:33Z", [0.98], ""], [71534, "2019-04-13T23:50:31Z", [0.95], ""], [71410, "2019-04-13T22:55:33Z", [0.99], ""], [71495, "2019-04-13T22:30:13Z", [0.7], ""], [71486, "2019-04-13T22:01:35Z", [0.5], ""], [71435, "2019-04-13T21:10:37Z", [0.93], ""], [71436, "2019-04-13T21:09:31Z", [0.9], ""], [71410, "2019-04-13T20:55:44Z", [0.99], ""], [71404, "2019-04-13T20:50:53Z", [0.85], ""], [71354, "2019-04-13T20:26:42Z", [1.0], "Yes.

We can\u2019t really say that because he did well in the first election he will do well in the second since his platform has changed, (the 2014 campaign was based off job creation and economic development) and  he made a bunch of promises that some feel he hasn\u2019t kept - there\u2019s unhappiness over agrarian distress, unemployment, demonetization, the Ayodhya temple.

GOOGLE TRENDS DATA\nThanks to @patrickmeehan5 for giving me this idea a little while ago. I took a look at Google trends data for Indian elections. First I checked my own country (Australia - similar parliamentary system) and it looks like search terms for party leaders did a pretty good job of predicting elections (although with a few caveats, as our own political system has its own issues). Then I checked India's 2009 and 2014 elections - trend data was higher for the winning candidate in both elections. (Before that, it was unclear - but it's reasonable to think that signals would be less clear as technology was less developed.) Right now, Modi is ahead of Gandhi in the trends, and this is consistent over the past 6 months. This is evidence in favour of a Modi victory. It's difficult to tell how much stock to put in this analysis. Without a systematic analysis (e.g. including other countries), it's hard to get a feel for the success rate of this method. Regardless, it bumps up my prediction by a conservative 4% or so. LABOR STRIKE One thing to think about is the strikes protesting against Modi's labor policies. By all estimates this was a huge strike (in the tens of millions) and it is reasonable to think that this will translate to voting against Modi for people who sympathize with the strikers. (For strike details see e.g. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/indian-workers-strike-in-fight-for-higher-wages).

These distributions, as with all mathematical models, were simplifications of reality. In this update, I address one simplification \u2013 the fact that seats lost by NDA might go to UPA. Here I\u2019m mostly looking at the elections 1991 \u2013 2014 (before that, BJP hadn\u2019t really gained momentum). Also, I\u2019m looking at coalitions rather than parties \u2013 the reason is simply that I have already produced models for coalitions, not for parties.\n    \u2022 There\u2019s a strong correlation between INC and BJP seats (0.933). Taken together, the two coalitions take, on average, 78% of seats.\n    \u2022 So we can think about the election in this way \u2013 imagine a world where INC starts with 100% of seats. Then the election involves people going in and casting their votes, and for each non-NDA vote, we subtract a seat from NDA. On average, 78% of votes subtracted from NDA in this way will be assigned to UPA. The other 22% will be assigned to the non-coalition parties.\n    \u2022 In my earlier analysis, I arrived at the following distribution for the NDA seats we can expect at the next election. (I did create two distributions for NDA, but after analysing state polls, I\u2019m wary of using poll data.)\n      NDA ~ N(258, 542)\n    \u2022 So if we model NDA as above, we can model UPA as dependent on NDA. Simply, NDA takes 78% of the seats that NDA does not get:\n      UPA = (543 \u2013 NDA) * 0.78\n    \u2022 In this model, I\u2019m going to assume that a coalition with more seats will win the election. This is an oversimplification of how minority governments form, but it\u2019s approximately correct \u2013 and good enough for the model. Where NDA wins 238 seats, UPA wins 238 seats. Where NDA is more successful, UPA is less successful, vice-versa. So, if NDA has more than 238 seats, NDA will form government, and where NDA has fewer than 238 seats, UPA will form government.\n    \u2022 (Note: In this model, there\u2019s no real need to model majority governments and minority governments separately.)\n    \u2022 So the steps from here are simple: all we have to do is, using the NDA distribution above, calculate the probability that NDA will win 238 or more seats. This probability (you can calculate using a spreadsheet) is 64.44%.\n    \u2022 The probability changes very little if you play around with the total % of seats taken by the two coalitions.\n    \u2022 So which of my approaches is better? This captures a part of reality that my previous analysis does not catch \u2013 although it has its own simplifications, it feels better than my previous analysis. The exception would be the economic factors in my previous analysis. So I want to apply equal weights to a) this analysis and b) my economic model from before, but no weight to c) poll data or d) my distribution model from before. That puts the probability of NDA forming government at the mean of 64.44 and 69.29%, which comes out to 66.87%."], [66490, "2019-01-10T10:37:50Z", [0.7], "Hard to see a change outwit external factors"], [63087, "2019-01-10T10:36:13Z", [0.7], ""], [66485, "2019-01-10T07:19:08Z", [0.75], ""], [66483, "2019-01-10T05:21:42Z", [0.6], ""], [15649, "2019-01-10T04:17:09Z", [0.85], "Recent setbacks in state polls will act as eye-opener for Modi.

In which case, I should weight this analysis and my previous analysis as 50% each.

Conclusions are at the bottom of the post. I haven't yet thought about how to incorporate this into my forecast - the first section is a strong point in favour of a BJP victory, and the second section (at worst) cancels out a point of evidence from my previous analysis. STATE ELECTIONS In the 16 elections in 2017 and 2018, BJP won 8 and lost 5. In the subset of 9 elections that were in 2018, BJP won 2 and INC won 4. So, taking 2017 and 2018 as a whole, BJP clearly performed better than INC. In just 2018, BJP performed (very marginally) worse than INC. But what about if we consider the size of the states? Some of these states only contribute 1 seat to the national elections, while Uttar Pradesh contributes 80 seats. So not all state election victories should be weighted equally. (Keep in mind there are 543 elected seats.) I summed the number of national election seats for which each party won the corresponding state election. This number is 122 for BJP and 106 for INC.\n    \u2022 Taking just the 2017 elections, the number is 119 for BJP and 13 for INC.\n    \u2022 Taking just the 2018 elections, the number is 3 for BJP and 93 for INC. So what\u2019s going on here? Has BJP\u2019s popularity absolutely plummeted, from literally 119 to 3, over the course of one year? Or did the 2018 elections just happen to line up with areas where BJP has become less popular?\n    \u2022 If BJP\u2019s popularity has plummeted: we would expect to see a swap from BJP domination to INC domination in the state seats where BJP won the national elections. In other words, we would expect low correlation between state control and national control.\n    \u2022 If the 2018 elections happen to favour INC: we would expect to see less change in domination, and INC domination in the national seats where INC won the state elections. In other words, we would expect high correlation between state control and national control. Also, we would expect most 2018 elections to have happened in places where INC had a higher proportion of national seats. For this analysis, I excluded two areas (Nagaland and Tripura) where there were 0 seats won between BJP and INC in either the state or national elections. 78% of areas with a higher BJP proportion of state seats also had a higher BJP proportion of national seats. (The total if 64% if you only count states where BJP ultimately formed government.) This means that only 22% of areas that preferred BJP in the national elections changed their minds. So what if this trend continues, and BJP loses 22% of its national seats? They\u2019d be down from 282 in 2014 to 220 in 2019. Adding this to the ~60 seats that BJP\u2019s allies in NDA usually win, we\u2019d expect 280 seats to BJP \u2013 which meets the majority requirement of 272. Alternatively, if NDA as a whole takes a hit of 22%, they would end up with 262 seats, which is just shy of the majority requirement \u2013 but still very close, and they would be likely to form a minority government. About the election years \u2013 the 2018 elections covered areas where INC already had an average of 45% of national seats. The 2017 elections covered areas where INC already had an average of 30% of national seats. So, it seems that INC was predisposed to fare better in 2018 than in 2017. PREDICTIVE POWER OF OPINION POLLS I looked at the predictions of the 10 state polls that I could find for 2017-18 state elections. (That is, the polls corresponding to 10 state elections \u2013 I considered all polls for a given period as equal.) For each polling period, I generated a 95% confidence interval for the average number of seats predicted for each party. Of 20 intervals (10 for BJP, 10 for INC), 9 contained the actual number of seats; 4 were close; and 7 were well off. Furthermore, only 5 of the 10 averaged polls correctly predicted which party would obtain more seats. From this, it looks like looking at polls to see who will win an election is no better than random. Looking at the actual number of seats, using a 95% confidence interval, was accurate or close-to-accurate for 13/20 polls. This might be chance, or it might be better-than-random \u2013 but even if it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s not much better. I\u2019m hesitant about extrapolating these results to national elections \u2013 I want more data for past national elections.

I\u2019m happy to reproduce any graphs/tables/analyses. My quantitative analysis will use statistics in ways they were never designed for. \nMos Def said \u201cPush too hard, even numbers got limits\u201d - but I think what I\u2019ve done here is fine within this context. I have two methods for predicting how many seats NDA will win \u2013 extrapolating time series, and extrapolating poll data.\nNote that, in the up-coming election, 543 seats are being contested. 272 seats is a majority. A hung parliament occurs if no coalition can achieve 272 seats. Time series of seats for NDA:\n    \u2022 The time series of national elections from 1996 \u2013 2014 show that the correlation between BJP\u2019s seats and NDA\u2019s seats is extremely high. But a correlation between BJP\u2019s seats and the non-BJP NDA seats is only about 30%. A scatterplot shows no clear pattern. So, it seems that the non-BJP parties in NDA usually get about 59 seats (min: 39, max: 87).\n    \u2022 The pattern of BJP\u2019s own seats over time shows a steady rise, a peak in the 98-99 elections, a steady fall, and then the enormous rise in the 2014 elections. It\u2019s hard to project this data, so there are a couple of choices:\n        \u25e6 Ignore 2014, and assume that BJP will receive about as many seats as in 2009 (116 seats),\n        \u25e6 Place the number of seats of BJP somewhere around the peak in 2014 (282 seats, probably lower).\n    \u2022 So the distribution of seats from NDA will look like:\n        \u25e6 A mean around the middle of the 2009 and 2014 results, plus the 59 allied seats = 258 seats.\n        \u25e6 A minimum at the 2009 election, plus a low of 39 allied seats = 155 seats.\n        \u25e6 A maximum at the 2014 election, plus a high of 87 allied seats = 369 seats. I\u2019d like to moderate this down to the 320-350 range, because a landslide victory and a landslide number of allies in combination seems extremely unlikely. My gut instinct says that NDA will almost certainly not go much higher than its 2014 victory, which was at 316 seats. So let\u2019s call the maximum 330 seats.\n        \u25e6 This means that this analysis generates a roughly symmetrical distribution of:\n            \u25aa Min 155 seats\n            \u25aa Mean 258 seats\n            \u25aa Max 369 seats\n        \u25e6 We can assume that the distribution is roughly bell-shaped (i.e. normally distributed). The way that normal distributions work is it\u2019s extremely unlikely for events to fall in the far tails \u2013 so we can simply specify that 155 and 369 seats are within the realm of possibility but not likely, or about 2 standard deviations from the mean. This way, we can estimate the probability of NDA obtaining a given number of seats.\n        \u25e6 The distance between the mean (258) and the two extremes (155, 369) is 103 and 111, so we can go with 107 as the average distance. If 107 is two standard deviations from the mean, then one standard deviation is about 54. So the distribution looks like:\n          NDA ~ N(258, 542)\n          In English, this means that the number of seats that NDA could obtain is normally distributed with a mean of 258 seats and a standard deviation of 54 seats.\n        \u25e6 272 seats are needed for a majority. This distribution actually means that NDA\u2019s mean is a minority. The normal cumulative distribution function (the NORM.DIST function in LibreOffice Calc or probably similar in Microsoft Excel) shows that the probability of getting 271.5 seats or fewer is 59.9%, so the probability of NDA getting a majority is 40.1%. Repeating for INC:\n    \u2022 I\u2019ll keep the allied seats obeying the same distribution (39-59-87). This is because UPA just has less data, but also because of the changing nature of coalitions \u2013 especially given the latest defections away from NDA.\n    \u2022 Using the same methods, we end up with a distribution of:\n        \u25e6 Min 44 plus 39 seats = 83 seats; but moderated again by 30-50 seats to, say, 123 seats\n        \u25e6 Mean 125 plus 59 seats = 184 seats\n        \u25e6 Max 206 plus 87 seats = 293 seats\n    \u2022 So the normal distribution looks like:\n      UPA ~ N(184, 542) Time series of seats from polls:\n    \u2022 The only polling data I can access is the polls before the 2014 election and the polls for the current election. I\u2019ll use the data for expected seats, not percentage votes.\n    \u2022 The data for the 2014 election showed a pattern of divergence over time, with NDA becoming more popular and UPA becoming less popular. No poll predicted the magnitude of NDA\u2019s victory, but the polls immediately before the election were actually quite close.\n    \u2022 The polls for this year show a convergence, with the popular NDA falling and the unpopular UPA regaining popularity.\n    \u2022 NDA seems to be slowly declining in popularity since 1 Jan 2018. Taking the poll data from this point onwards shows the following regression line, where x = days since 1 Jan 2018, and y = expected seats:\n      y = -0.1177x + 303.82\n    \u2022 Extrapolating this trend to 1 May 2019 (approximate date of elections) means that NDA is expected to win 246.7 seats, which is shy of the 272 needed for a majority.\n    \u2022 Another way of looking the data is to imagine that there will be no change in popularity between now and election date \u2013 in other words, we can take the number of expected seats from the most recent polls as our estimate of the seats that will be won in reality.\n    \u2022 NDA\u2019s popularity seems to have been relatively constant since Apr 2018. The sample of expected seats from Apr 2018 to today has a mean of 269.4 and a sample standard deviation of 21.68.\n    \u2022 We can even carry across the sample standard deviation to the regression line above. This gives us two distributions for the expected number of seats:\n      NDA ~ N(246.7, 21.682)\n      NDA ~ N(269.4, 21.682)\n    \u2022 To produce an average of these distributions, we can consider the mean as the mean of the means (haha):\n      NDA ~ N(258.1, 21.682)\n    \u2022 I\u2019m absolutely stunned that the mean here (258.1) and the mean in the time series analysis above (258) are the same.\n    \u2022 Using the sample cumulative distribution function as earlier, the probability of getting 271.5 seats or fewer is 73.2%, so the probability of NDA getting a majority is 26.8%. Repeating for UPA:\n    \u2022 The regression equation is:\n      y = 0.09536x + 172.12\n      This extrapolates such that the expected number of seats for UPA on 1 May 2019 is 172.\n    \u2022 The sample of expected seats from Apr 2018 to today has a mean of 157 and a sample standard deviation of 47.77.\n    \u2022 Thus the two distributions for the expected number of seats are:\n      UPA ~ N(157, 47.772)\n      UPA ~ N(172.12, 47.772)\n    \u2022 The mean of the means means that:\n      UPA ~ N(164.56, 47.772) To summarise, here are the four distributions that I have generated. I\u2019ll give them all a subscript to denote whether they were obtained using time series of seats (t) or by extrapolating poll data (p).\n    \u2022 NDAt ~ N(258, 542) [based on seats over time]\n    \u2022 NDAp ~ N(258.1, 21.682) [based on extrapolating poll data]\n    \u2022 UPAt ~ N(184, 542) [based on seats over time]\n    \u2022 UPAp ~ N(164.56, 47.772) [based on extrapolating poll data] These four distributions can be used to calculate the probability that:\n    \u2022 NDA will obtain 272 or more seats\n        \u25e6 40.1% and 26.8%, average to 33.48% for an NDA majority\n    \u2022 UPA will obtain 272 or more seats\n        \u25e6 5.26% and 3.34%, average to 4.30% for a UPA majority\n    \u2022 The remaining probability is 62.2% for a hung parliament. What if there is a hung parliament?\n    \u2022 Firstly, given the situation of a hung parliament, it\u2019s difficult to forecast how negotiations will turn out. Instead, I will use the number of seats that each coalition gets as a proxy for negotiating power / the ability to form a minority government.\n    \u2022 What\u2019s the probability of NDA having more seats than UPA? The following numbers are generated from many observations taken at random from the normal distributions.\n        \u25e6 Using the time series distributions: NDA gets more seats (but not a majority) 43.6% of the time, and UPA 12.7% of the time.\n        \u25e6 Using the poll distributions: NDA 71.2%, and UPA 3.1%.\n        \u25e6 Using time series for NDA and poll for UPA: NDA 55%, and UPA 8%.\n        \u25e6 Using poll for NDA and time series for UPA: NDA 66.5%, and UPA 4.6%.\n        \u25e6 If you standardize each pair then calculate the averages for each party, you get: \n          Given that there is a hung parliament, NDA is 88.53% to get more seats but not have a majority, and UPA is 11.47% to get more seats but not have a majority.\n        \u25e6 Also note: In the situation of a hung parliament, NDA is, on average, 43.94 seats ahead of UPA.\n    \u2022 Secondly, I want to think about the defections that have happened from NDA recently.\n        \u25e6 The major supporting parties for BJP in 2014 were Shiv Sena (18 seats); Telugu Desam Party (16 seats); Lok Janshakti Party (6 seats); Shiromani Akali Dal (4 seats) and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (3 seats).\n        \u25e6 Telugu Desam Party defected from the NDA in March 2018. Rashtriya Lok Samata Party defected from the NDA in December 2018.\n        \u25e6 [INC\u2019s major supporters in 2014 were National Congress Party (6 seats); and Rashtriya Janata Dal (4 seats). Shiv Sena supported INC in 2009. INC\u2019s biggest supporter in 2009 (All India Trinamool Congress; 19 seats) is no longer part of UPA, but rather the Third Front.]\n        \u25e6 Telugu Desam Party\u2019s defection in particular is a loss of 16 seats \u2013 given that a hung parliament is the most probably situation, this is a massive swing towards the UPA. Even assuming that Shiv Sena continues to support NDA, a hung parliament situation is less favourable for NDA than the above numbers would indicate.\n        \u25e6 I\u2019m not sure what the best way to incorporate this information is \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s best just to subtract 16 from each of the above NDA distributions and add 16 to each of the UPA distributions.\n            \u25aa NDAt2 ~ N(243, 542) [based on seats over time]\n            \u25aa NDAp2 ~ N(243.1, 21.682) [based on extrapolating poll data]\n            \u25aa UPAt2 ~ N(200, 542) [based on seats over time]\n            \u25aa UPAp2 ~ N(180.56, 47.772) [based on extrapolating poll data]\n        \u25e6 Using the time series distributions: NDA gets more seats (but not a majority) 44.9% of the time, and UPA 21.1% of the time.\n        \u25e6 Using the poll distributions: NDA 78.9%, and UPA 10.6%.\n        \u25e6 Using time series for NDA and poll for UPA: NDA 51.3%, and UPA 15.4%.\n        \u25e6 Using poll for NDA and time series for UPA: NDA 65.8%, and UPA 14.1%.\n        \u25e6 If you standardize each pair then calculate the averages for each party, you get: \n          Given that there is a hung parliament, NDA is 78.87% to get more seats but not have a majority, and UPA is 21.14% to get more seats but not have a majority.\n        \u25e6 In a hung parliament even considering defections, NDA maintains a 24.71 average seat lead.\n        \u25e6 My gut instinct says that these numbers underestimate the effects of party defections. I think that the probabilities of each party\u2019s success in a hung parliament are closer to half-half than this above analysis makes out. So I might roll with 60% for NDA and 40% for UPA. (I\u2019ll consider both, but I have more faith in this gut instinct set of numbers.) Combining everything\n    \u2022 NDA majority: 33.48%\n    \u2022 UPA majority: 4.30%\n    \u2022 NDA minority government: 62.2% x 78.87% = 49.06% (numbers at face value)\n      OR  62.2% x 60% = 37.32% (gut instinct)\n    \u2022 UPA minority government: 62.2% x 21.14% = 13.15% (numbers at face value)\n      OR 62.2% x 40% = 24.88% (gut instinct) Therefore:\n    \u2022 NDA government = 33.48% + 49.06% = 82.54%\n      OR 33.48% + 37.32% = 70.80%\n    \u2022 [UPA government = 17.45%, or 29.2%] Below I have outlined a rough analysis by which economic factors can predict whether a government is re-elected. This is a total probability for re-election; it can\u2019t predict the number of seats. Consider it as separate to the analysis above. Economic factors:\n    \u2022 There\u2019s a good analysis here (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/) on predicting elections using economic effects. The author calls for using a) many economic factors; b) broad economic factors; c) regularly updated factors.\n    \u2022 I will use the following data sets (available from World Bank https://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&country=IND):\n        \u25e6 GDP per capita growth (annual %)\n        \u25e6 Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)\n        \u25e6 Inflation, GDP deflator: linked series (annual %)\n        \u25e6 Gross national expenditure (% of GDP) (note: I subtracted 100 from this, to keep it on the same scale as the others. Doesn\u2019t change results.)\n    \u2022 Note on inflation: Although I do have a qualification in economics, but haven\u2019t the foggiest idea which of these two measures of inflation is more important as an election predictor. I\u2019ll average them for the years where both are available.\n    \u2022 I won\u2019t use unemployment. While unemployment strikes me as important, World Bank data estimates that India\u2019s total unemployment is remarkably constant around 3.5%, with very little year-to-year variation. So this variable won\u2019t really affect the model.\n    \u2022 I ignore the 1991 election, because the previous election was won by National Front but this coalition fell apart after their term. I ignore the 1998 election, because the 1996 election was won by BJP but they left office due to instability. (The 1999 election covers this time period just fine anyway, so I\u2019m counting 1998 and 1999 as one election.)\n    \u2022 I generated two models. The first model\u2019s response variable is the number of seats given to the ruling party at the next election. This model had extremely poor explanatory power, so I have decided not to use it in the analysis. The second model is a logistic model where the response variable is binary, whether or not the ruling party was returned to power. This second model had much better (still not amazing \u2013 but better) explanatory power.\n    \u2022 Long-story short: the model is actually quite strong, given the noisy and not-that-good data. Out of 7 elections used to generate the model, and crudely dividing the probabilities into <50% means no and >50% means yes, the model is successful at 5. (This is a measurement of model fit, not predictive power.)\n    \u2022 Using data up to 2017 (so only missing 2018 data), the model predicts a 30.7% probability of a change in government. In other words, it places the probability of BJP being re-elected at 69.29%. Combining the seat analysis with the economic analysis:\n    \u2022 Average of 70.80% and 69.29% is 70.045%. So my estimate for NDA\u2019s return to government after the 2019 elections is 70.045%. Now let\u2019s address other election concerns.\n    \u2022 Modi is 68 years old, and he may die before being sworn into government. The mortality tables indicate that the probability of a 68-year old man in India dying before the end of May is 1.09%.\n    \u2022 It\u2019s possible for Modi to leave the leadership of the party \u2026\n        \u25e6 \u2026 by the party\u2019s request: I\u2019m going to consider this probability negligible, because Modi is extremely popular compared to anybody else who could lead the party. Past polls on Wikipedia have even got separate entries for BJP\u2019s success under some other leader, which is always given as lower.\n        \u25e6 \u2026 if it turns out he\u2019s committed some crime: I don\u2019t know what the probability of this is. How many Asian heads-of-party are kicked from the position due to criminal proceedings? It did sorta happen to the head of INC recently, but I\u2019m going to assume that the probability for it happening to Modi in the next few months is negligible. (Clearly more work will improve my estimate here.)\n        \u25e6 \u2026 if he decides to leave politics: In Hamilton, King George III said \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that was something a person could do.\u201d What\u2019s the chance that Modi decides that leading India to greatness isn\u2019t for him, and decides to retire to the Pacific to pursue his career as an athlete/artist/model? Again, seems unlikely. Given my thoughts here, I\u2019m going to place the chance of Modi being sworn in as the chance of NDA returning to government multiplied by the probability of Modi not dying.\n    \u2022 70.045*(100-1.09) = 69.282% The most important factors that would change my analysis are a) new polls that are very different from last time, b) the release of 2018 economic data in a format comparable with the World Bank, c) major changes in Modi\u2019s life."], [1333, "2018-12-31T20:58:45Z", [0.67], ""], [34353, "2018-12-31T14:17:51Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2018-12-31T12:51:55Z", [0.75], ""], [60463, "2018-12-31T11:52:24Z", [0.6], ""], [32002, "2018-12-31T08:18:10Z", [0.7], ""], [63795, "2018-12-30T21:47:38Z", [0.83], ""], [56, "2018-12-30T20:21:56Z", [0.75], "Current opinion polling seems to suggest a slight edge to Modi's BJP.
