But the Trump administration has faced a more basic challenge: persuading the world, after weeks of bureaucratic dysfunction, that it can handle fast-moving events.\nFor an administration that has lurched from crisis to crisis, often seeming to make things up as it goes along, this was a chance for Mr. Tillerson and Mr. McMaster to offer a forceful explanation of Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking. For both men, who have struggled with personnel upheavals at their agencies and doubts about their place in Mr. Trump\u2019s turbulent orbit, it was a chance to show that they were wielding influence over critical national security decisions.\" \nComments: The gas attack in Syria and following global outrage came at the right time.
