Poliquin is the only Republican representing a U.S. House seat in New England. Before Poliquin was first elected in 2014, Democrats had held the seat for 20 years. Poliquin won re-election in 2016 by nearly 10 points. Minnesota's 1st Congressional District: Former Obama administration official Dan Feehan (D) and former U.S. Treasury official Jim Hagedorn (R) are running for the 1st District, which covers all of southern Minnesota's border with Iowa. In 2016, incumbent Tim Walz (D) defeated Hagedorn by 1 percentage point, and Donald Trump (R) carried the district by 15 percentage points, making it one of 13 Democratic-held seats up in 2018 that Trump won. Walz chose to run for governor rather than seek re-election. Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District: U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R) and Wallace Global Fund director Scott Wallace (D) are running for the newly-drawn 1st District, north of Philadelphia, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered the state's congressional map redrawn in February 2018. The new 1st District is composed of a majority of the old 8th District, which Fitzpatrick was first elected to represent in 2016. The old 8th District voted for Donald Trump (R) in 2016 by 0.2 percentage points. The new 1st District voted for Hillary Clinton (D) by 2.0 percentage points. The redrawing of the congressional map changed the presidential results in Pennsylvania's 18 congressional districts from 12 Trump districts and six Clinton districts to 10 Trump districts and eight Clinton districts. Texas' 32nd Congressional District: Incumbent Rep. Pete Sessions (R), civil rights attorney Colin Allred (D), and Melina Baker (L) are running to represent the 32nd District, which is located in the Dallas metro area. Sessions, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, was first elected in 2002.

Moreover, the media narrative is shifting in favor of the Republicans. Remains to be seen how, if at all, the tragic events of the last 72 hours will change that. As of now, however, I think the probability mass remains concentrated on a narrow Dem victory, but it is much more likely for the Rs to win than for the Ds to get more than 230 seats. As the popular vote for House seems heavily tilted in favor of the Ds, a distinct possibility emerges that the Rs could keep control over the House with less votes than Ds, like in 2012, thanks to gerrymandering.

Cook and Sabato's main projection seems to be 220-230 D seats, while 538 goes above 230.   3) Less than 230 vs more than 230 D seats: this is trickier. Stil, I go 3-1 for less than  230 because: (i) usually, there is a last-minute reversion to the mean - the advantage of the leading party declines; 2) Gerrymandering means that Dems need a 5-6% lead in the popular vote just to break even (currently their leas is 8-9 percent in the generic vote, but I expect it to shrink a little noted above)\n"], [23006, "2018-10-21T01:32:12Z", [0.19, 0.37, 0.22, 0.22], ""], [57970, "2018-10-21T01:31:39Z", [0.09, 0.85, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [691, "2018-10-20T21:31:01Z", [0.15, 0.66, 0.19, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-10-20T21:05:26Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2018-10-20T21:04:23Z", [0.67, 0.33, 0.0, 0.0], "538 Nate it looks like 230-240 from my Bayesian lines"], [50825, "2018-10-20T21:02:26Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [705, "2018-10-20T19:30:22Z", [0.2, 0.7, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2018-10-20T18:28:27Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.38, 0.42], ""], [24162, "2018-10-20T14:07:11Z", [0.11, 0.61, 0.28, 0.0], ""], [61639, "2018-10-20T11:09:20Z", [0.0, 0.22, 0.78, 0.0], ""], [4681, "2018-10-20T03:34:55Z", [0.15, 0.4, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [4681, "2018-10-19T15:21:44Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [1333, "2018-10-19T04:09:47Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.37, 0.43], ""], [23006, "2018-10-19T00:49:02Z", [0.04, 0.4, 0.22, 0.34], ""], [23006, "2018-10-19T00:48:31Z", [0.04, 0.22, 0.4, 0.34], ""], [2965, "2018-10-18T23:40:51Z", [0.66, 0.33, 0.01, 0.0], "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/\nand it might be curtains for Feinstein\nunless she can rope a dope \nhttp://ucdata.berkeley.edu/data_record.php?recid=3\nFeinstein\t\nCompare Newsom\nto Leon/Feinstein\t+11\nU.S. Senate\t\u2022\tCalif.\t\t\nSEP 17-OCT 14\nshe was plus 17\nCA Bernie wave\nand DIFI could be done\nodds of winning 5th term as US Senator\nshe should have 50% like Gavin\nthis spells trouble\nSee PRNewswire/ -- A poll released today by 1st Tuesday Campaigns, a new bi-partisan firm focused on state and international ballot referendums and initiatives, showed incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein with a significant lead heading into Wednesday's debate with State Senator Kevin de Le\u00f3n. The October 5-6 survey of 1,038 likely California voters has Feinstein up 13 points over de Le\u00f3n \u2013 43%-30% with a significant 27% still undecided. Senate Race\nKevin de Le\u00f3n faces a steep uphill climb in his quest to unseat California's senior Senator. While incumbency is proving to be a drag around many elected officials around the country this cycle, that does not appear to be the case in California. Feinstein's approval rating remains solid with a 56% job approval. Her numbers match popular current Governor Jerry Brown who receives a 55% approval rating. Despite numbers well into the 50's, Feinstein does see drop off when voters are asked which candidate they plan to vote for in November. She drops to 43% supporting her reelection. Despite Feinstein's precarious position, de Le\u00f3n does not appear to be making significant headway in his race to unseat her and garners just 30% of the vote. More problematic for him, early voting has already begun in the state meaning he must not only make up ground quickly but also overcompensate for the polling position in which he currently finds himself. Analysis\nTime is running out for Kevin de Le\u00f3n to make this a real race. California's top two primary system has led to a second straight Democrat vs. Democrat general election for the U.S. Senate. At a time of heightened Democratic intensity and a surge in progressive activism, Senator Feinstein's incumbency and more moderate profile appeared to be potential weaknesses heading into this election. However, de Le\u00f3n has not tapped into any of that energy. He is losing among every demographic in our poll other than Republican voters, and his lead there is likely due to his lack of name recognition \u2013 Republicans see Feinstein as the only Democrat in the race.  Senator de Le\u00f3n even loses among Latino voters \u2013 a segment that his campaign likely saw as their base at the beginning of this effort. On top of that, his fundraising numbers remain weak. The lone bright spot for the de Le\u00f3n campaign is the still high number of undecided voters \u2013 27%. With Feinstein's name recognition and long service to the state, she should be in a stronger position with the electorate at this point. If voters are still undecided about Feinstein at this point in the race, with all of her structural advantages and high profile, then they clearly are looking elsewhere. These voters represent a glimmer of hope for de Le\u00f3n. \nFeinstein\t\n41%\n30%\nde Leon\tFeinstein\t+11\nOC Dems sweep brings total with PA and Ohio Northeast to a BIg Blue 237\nGoodbye Dana Rohrbacker and Mr. Benghazi Darryl Issa\ngone\n"], [1333, "2018-10-18T20:50:10Z", [0.01, 0.19, 0.37, 0.43], ""], [41389, "2018-10-18T10:46:23Z", [0.5, 0.33, 0.14, 0.03], "per the classic forecast of fivethirtyeight."], [34725, "2018-10-18T06:54:42Z", [0.3, 0.58, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [32258, "2018-10-18T03:23:11Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38, "2018-10-18T01:11:35Z", [0.3, 0.61, 0.09, 0.0], ""], [38319, "2018-10-18T00:23:27Z", [0.46, 0.35, 0.16, 0.03], "Continuing to base my forecast on the median of the 3 models at 538.

He is president of Ellis Insight, LLC. We invited him to share analysis of primary turnout. At this point in the 2018 election cycle, 37 states have held primary elections and so far the actual voting patterns may be contradicting some prognosticators and pollsters\u2019 common wisdom. Most in the aforementioned group are predicting that Democratic voter enthusiasm is such that a \"blue wave\" could form. But when looking at who is actually turning out in the 2018 elections, a more typical midterm participation pattern exists. More Republicans than Democrats are voting in states that tend to support GOP candidates, and more Democrats than Republicans are coming to the polls in places where the former party\u2019s candidates typically win the preponderance of elections. In the south and Rocky Mountain region, and pertaining to certain Midwest states, more Republicans are voting. In the east, Pacific Northwest, and a different Midwest domain subset more Democrats are voting. But, there are reasons to delve deeper within those numbers. In California, while Democrats turned out in greater numbers for the statewide jungle primary in early June, more Republicans voted in six of the seven congressional districts where Democrats are targeting as must-win elections. Turning to Pennsylvania, where Democrats have more than an 800,000-person statewide voter registration advantage, the party turnout figure exceeded Republican participation by only about 15,000 individuals. Looking at New York, where upstart candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocked ten-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D) from the Democratic ballot and forcing him to only appear on the Working Families Party line in the general election, only 27,658 people voted, allowing the challenger to win with under 16,000 votes. Statewide, in 13 Democratic congressional primaries, the party averaged a turnout percentage of just over 11 percent. Yet in two states that have been consistently voting Republican since the turn of the century, West Virginia and Kentucky, more Democrats voted in those state primaries. Thus, we are seeing some examples of juxtaposition within the electorate, which makes predicting the fall results even more difficult. Primary turnout does not ultimately predict general election participation figures or results, but it does provide an idea of how the electorate is responding. While news reports, generic polls, certain presidential approval ratings, and some more local special election results suggest 2018 will be a more Democratic year than in recent past midterm elections, actual voter participation in two-thirds of the states already holding primary elections appear to be foretelling a different story."], [691, "2018-08-13T13:45:27Z", [0.01, 0.55, 0.44, 0.0], ""], [705, "2018-08-12T19:45:58Z", [0.15, 0.68, 0.15, 0.02], ""], [5018, "2018-08-12T17:58:03Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-08-12T12:56:32Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [53391, "2018-08-11T23:33:51Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.6, 0.15], ""], [52343, "2018-08-10T14:16:47Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [60157, "2018-08-10T05:07:32Z", [0.35, 0.05, 0.3, 0.3], ""], [172, "2018-08-09T23:58:12Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [41318, "2018-08-09T23:20:53Z", [0.02, 0.63, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [41318, "2018-08-09T20:16:26Z", [0.02, 0.63, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [41318, "2018-08-09T20:07:46Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [36132, "2018-08-09T16:09:04Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-08-09T14:59:41Z", [0.01, 0.18, 0.31, 0.5], ""], [41922, "2018-08-09T08:46:02Z", [0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2018-08-09T08:36:30Z", [0.25, 0.71, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-08-09T05:28:55Z", [0.02, 0.53, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [20588, "2018-08-08T22:22:36Z", [0.03, 0.57, 0.39, 0.01], "Updating."], [59882, "2018-08-08T21:10:43Z", [0.02, 0.74, 0.24, 0.0], "Feeding the latest election forecasts of competitive seats through an election simulator gives the following results;     [1.

Additionally, there are 12 districts rated as barely tilting in the Republican direction. The 34 high-risk seats are not the only concern for Republicans. There are also 16 Republican seats that are very competitive but lean in the GOP direction. On top of that, there are 23 GOP seats that could be at risk if the political environment becomes more favorable to Democrats this fall. To win majority control, Democrats need to gain 23 seats in November. Only four Democratic seats are considered high-risk. That includes two toss-ups and two races barely tilting in the Democratic direction. Republicans are not currently favored in any Democratic districts.

In a report released today, Ballotpedia analyzes 100 years of election results to see how each president\u2019s party performed in even-year elections. With that data, Ballotpedia proposes an objective way to define a wave election going forward. To be classified as a wave election, a set of elections must fall within the 20 percent of elections where the president's party lost the most seats across the last 50 election cycles (100 years). A collaboration between political scientist Jacob Smith and Ballotpedia, our analysis explores how this definition applies to U.S. House, U.S. Senate, gubernatorial, and state legislative elections and what this means for 2018. We look forward to engaging in discussion about whether it is possible or desirable to objectively define a wave election. Throughout the rest of this week, we\u2019ll explore the four facets of the data. First, we preview U.S. House elections, which is where political observers most often discuss the possibility of Democratic gains in 2018. Under our definition, Republicans would need to lose 48 House seats for 2018 to qualify historically as a wave. U.S. House waves in the last 100 years include the Republican takeovers in 1994 and 2010 under Clinton (D) and Obama (D), respectively, and the 1930 and 1932 Democratic gains under Hoover (R) during the Great Depression."], [691, "2018-06-16T13:19:03Z", [0.0, 0.52, 0.48, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2018-06-16T06:36:52Z", [0.17, 0.45, 0.35, 0.03], ""], [5018, "2018-06-16T03:16:37Z", [0.02, 0.38, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [1250, "2018-06-15T12:20:14Z", [0.05, 0.64, 0.26, 0.05], ""], [59025, "2018-06-14T02:08:36Z", [0.15, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35831, "2018-06-13T23:47:06Z", [0.02, 0.38, 0.57, 0.03], "Last year \"blue wave\" prediction was based on:\n- 19 points lead by Democrats in generic ballot and a Trump approval of 32\n- Korea fire missiles and threaten nuclear war\n- Doubt of Trump administration prediction that it is possible to get over 3% GDP\n- Unable to repeal Obamacare\n- Illegal immigration issues such as DACA will depress GOP numbers\n- Collusion with Russia investigation may uncover wrong doing So far, Trump has survived and thrived:\n- Generic ballot gap narrowed and his approval is up\n- While doubt that North Koreans are sincere and Trump has achieved lasting success, good sentiment will continue to be developed through the end of the year. \n- The economy is going well, and voters generally reward the party that brings them jobs and money\n- While Trump and GOP still couldn't repeal Obamacare (the only Obama's legacy coded into law that Trump has not been able to undo), they have sufficiently undermined it. Since many aspects of the law was coded in languages such as \"at the discretion of the Secretary [of health and human resources]\", a way to give maximum leeway to Obama administration, the party in power at the White House may \"deregulate\" the law, further neutralize it.\n- DACA fight seems to have Trump gaining ground instead of depressing his number.\n- Collusion with Russia probe seems to give Trump advantage too, the longer it drags on. Not only it has not generate anything damaging to Trump so far, it exposed corruption and abuse of power by the FBI leadership and more importantly give Trump the image of an underdog fighter who succeeded regardless of how the odd is tilted against him.

In addition, the forecaster Cook Political Report announced Tuesday it was moving four seats \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s second district, South Carolina's fifth district and California's 39th and 49th districts \u2014 toward the Republicans. Cook\u2019s analysis cited  \u201csub-optimal primary outcomes\u201d as a key component in the shift, meaning Democrats are nominating candidates who are less likely to win. \n. . . \nRepublican campaign strategists say they aren\u2019t surprised by the primary results on the Democratic side, saying they reflect the ascension of the left during the Trump administration. \u201cWe were expecting that \u2014 people have kind of underestimated the progressive strain that exists in the [Democratic] Party,\u201d one GOP source involved in the midterms told The Hill. \u201cSo, a lot of the more progressive candidates have prevailed.\u201d \n. . . \nDemocrats have also won several special elections in districts that had previously been safe for Republicans. Even in races they have lost, the Democratic candidate has often improved upon the party\u2019s usual showing in the district.  The party also got a shot in the arm from redistricting in Pennsylvania, which will likely result in them winning several additional seats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) has expressed confidence that Democrats will pick up the 23 seats needed to regain the majority \u2014 and potentially return her to the Speaker\u2019s office.\n. . . \nBut House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has repeatedly said he thinks Republicans will hold on to the House, likening the current political climate to the circumstances seen during the 1998 election, when Republicans lost five seats but held the majority. During an event at the Milken Institute\u2019s Global Conference this month, McCarthy argued that GOP candidates would benefit at the polls from the strong economy, regardless of the controversies swirling around President Trump and his administration. \u201cWe have our challenge \u2014 history says the party in power loses 29 seats in an off year and 23 seats is our majority,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIn January, I gave this presentation \u2014 it was plus 12 for the Democrats. Today, if you take a rolling average, just plus 5.5. We have a 4-point advantage \u2014 if we get 49 percent of the national vote, we'll have 53 percent of the seats.\u201d While Republicans are feeling more confident about their chances of holding the House majority, it\u2019s clear that some members are fighting for their political lives. More than 20 moderate Republicans \u2014 many tough facing reelection races \u2014 have signed on to a discharge petition introduced by Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) to force votes on four immigration measures. Their aim is to approve protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump is ending. The program allows illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to live, work and go to school in the United States. The Washington Post noted 12 of the Republicans that signed the discharge petition are running in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and many represent districts with a large Hispanic population. While forcing action on immigration could help Republicans in swing districts, both leadership and immigration hardliners have come out strongly against the measure.   Some have warned that passing a bill backfire, depressing turnout at the polls from the Republican base. McCarthy has warned members of his caucus that, should the discharge petition move forward, it could cost them the election.

Based upon movement in the generic ballot in midterm campaigns from this point in the cycle to the election since 1938, we'd expect the margin to remain roughly the same on Election Day 2018 (Democrats +7).\" \"A seven-point lead for the Democrats on the generic congressional ballot is far from a guarantee that they'd take back the House. In fact, my estimate based upon on how district lines are drawn suggest that Democrats would probably be a 50:50 proposition of gaining enough seats (23) to take back the House, if they won the national House vote by 7 percentage points.\" \"Now, it is true that Republicans are faring far worse in special congressional elections than you might expect in an environment in which they were down only 7 points on the generic congressional ballot. They have been outperforming the average partisan lean of the districts and states involved in special congressional elections by an astounding 17 percentage points. And as I have pointed out over and over again, there has been a clear correlation between special election results in midterm cycles and the House popular vote since 1994.\" \"Yet, keep in mind the sample size we're dealing with in special elections: nine. Although the signal from those nine has been fairly clear, nine elections is still a relatively small sample size.\" \"We're also only looking at races without incumbents when examining special elections. We know from history that incumbents tend to do better than the partisan lean of a district would suggest. About 80% of all Republican held seats up for grabs this fall will feature incumbents.\" \"Indeed, the last time Democrats were doing so well in special elections, they didn't perform as well in the midterms as the special elections suggested. In 2006, they outperformed the partisan lean in special congressional elections by 15 points. That's a little more than the 17 points so far this cycle, though it is in the same ballpark.

The correlation between the president\u2019s approval number and first-term midterm losses by the president\u2019s party: In the six times that the president\u2019s job approval was under 50%, the average loss was more than 43 seats. The Democrats need 24 to flip the House.\" \"2. CA + PA = half-way there: California is the citadel of the resistance, which has 14 House Republicans. Between retirements, losing state-and-local tax deductions in the tax bill, and Trump\u2019s California disapproval, the Golden State could lose half its GOP delegation. The new Pennsylvania redistricting map \u2014 and similar anti-Trump trend lines \u2014 could cost Rs as many as six seats. These two states get you halfway to a Democratic House.\" \"3. Suburban danger zones: 2018 could make the suburbs great again for the House Democrats. The Democratic victories in last year's Virginia and New Jersey governor's races could well be the canaries in the coal mine. Remember that there are 23 House Republican seats in districts Clinton won \u2014 and most are suburban.\" \"4. Trump Coalition Unique to Trump: This is the biggest wildcard. Just like we saw with Obama voters in the midterms of 2010 and 2014, we suspect the unique coalition that supported the president will not turn out for generic House members of that President\u2019s party.

On the other hand, sources focused on the inside rate (race-by-race) seem to predict a D gain of 10-20 seats, insufficient for a majority. How to reconcile these predictions? I think the race-by-race sources should be more accurate in principle, as they take into account (i) the re-districting effect since 2010 (favoring Rs) and (ii) the local specifics - the popularity of the candidates, when they are known, the degree of mobilization of parties' bases etc. Yet it's hard to reconcile a D lead in the generic ballot of some 8 points with not gaining the majority in the House.

The party out of the White House has picked up 24-plus seats in only four of the past 10 midterm elections.[2]\n- We see that not many House races were all that competitive in 2016.
