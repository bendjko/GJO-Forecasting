This bodes well for Rs.  - an intriguing (for forecasters) tendency is that the Senate elections will be entirely dominated by the inside view (what is happening on the ground in each race) as opposed to the outside view (what has happened previously in similar situations). Specifically, Rs seem well positioned to keep or even add to their Senate seats even though the nation-wide popular vote swings against them. This seems to be the result of two inside characteristics: (i) the Senate electoral map in 2018, and (ii) the rural vs. urban aspect of the political polarization, which helps Rs in the Senate and Dems in the House.     - as for my specific choices, I now give ND and TN to the Rs. I maintain my previous calls that TX remains an R seat, while WV and MT - Dems' (although Tester does not look invincible in MT). This leaves five toss-ups: AZ, NV, IN, MO, and FL. For these, I use the average probability between Nate Silver's shop (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/?ex_cid=rrpromo) and predictit (https://www.predictit.org/markets/1/US-Elections?filterIds=1,5&sort=traded&sortParameter=ALL). Silver still seems to lean toward higher Dems chances, while predictit customers have turned quite a bit toward Rs recently.

He is president of Ellis Insight, LLC. We invited him to share analysis of primary turnout. At this point in the 2018 election cycle, 37 states have held primary elections and so far the actual voting patterns may be contradicting some prognosticators and pollsters\u2019 common wisdom. Most in the aforementioned group are predicting that Democratic voter enthusiasm is such that a \"blue wave\" could form. But when looking at who is actually turning out in the 2018 elections, a more typical midterm participation pattern exists. More Republicans than Democrats are voting in states that tend to support GOP candidates, and more Democrats than Republicans are coming to the polls in places where the former party\u2019s candidates typically win the preponderance of elections. In the south and Rocky Mountain region, and pertaining to certain Midwest states, more Republicans are voting. In the east, Pacific Northwest, and a different Midwest domain subset more Democrats are voting. But, there are reasons to delve deeper within those numbers. In California, while Democrats turned out in greater numbers for the statewide jungle primary in early June, more Republicans voted in six of the seven congressional districts where Democrats are targeting as must-win elections. Turning to Pennsylvania, where Democrats have more than an 800,000-person statewide voter registration advantage, the party turnout figure exceeded Republican participation by only about 15,000 individuals. Looking at New York, where upstart candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocked ten-term Rep. Joe Crowley (D) from the Democratic ballot and forcing him to only appear on the Working Families Party line in the general election, only 27,658 people voted, allowing the challenger to win with under 16,000 votes. Statewide, in 13 Democratic congressional primaries, the party averaged a turnout percentage of just over 11 percent. Yet in two states that have been consistently voting Republican since the turn of the century, West Virginia and Kentucky, more Democrats voted in those state primaries. Thus, we are seeing some examples of juxtaposition within the electorate, which makes predicting the fall results even more difficult. Primary turnout does not ultimately predict general election participation figures or results, but it does provide an idea of how the electorate is responding. While news reports, generic polls, certain presidential approval ratings, and some more local special election results suggest 2018 will be a more Democratic year than in recent past midterm elections, actual voter participation in two-thirds of the states already holding primary elections appear to be foretelling a different story."], [1333, "2018-08-13T14:42:20Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.42, 0.56], ""], [691, "2018-08-13T13:41:57Z", [0.0, 0.49, 0.51, 0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-08-12T16:10:46Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.45], "Following @nigster - just flattening the numbers considerably to account for polls uncertainty.

In fact, they\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it over the years. . . .  the Senate . . . has an inherent Republican bias . . .  To quantify how well Democrats have overcome this handicap in the past . . .  At least since 1992, . . . Democrats have regularly faced unfavorable Senate maps (albeit none as bad as 2018\u2019s), and they have regularly overperformed anyway, winning an average of 2.4 more seats per cycle than they are entitled to based on partisan lean alone. Much of this is likely because of the advantage of incumbency, but on three occasions (1992, 2006 and 2012), Democrats have actually gained Senate seats despite being at a partisan-lean disadvantage.5 Only in three famously strong GOP wave years (1994, 2010 and 2014) have Republicans overperformed the partisan baseline. The good news for Senate Democrats is that, given the party\u2019s healthy lead in generic-ballot polling, they are likely to overperform again this year. The bad news is that overperforming by enough to take back control would be unprecedented (at least in modern history). . . .  Democrats need to overperform by a whopping 11 seats in order to snag a majority. Still, Democrats should probably be thrilled with an overperformance of even half that. . . .  In short, 2018 could be not just bad, but a veritable armaggeddon for Senate Democrats. They should count their lucky stars that their worst-case map looks like it\u2019s going to coincide with their best-case turnout environment. The Senate isn\u2019t just biased toward Republicans; it\u2019s really biased toward Republicans. Going by partisan lean, there are 31 states more Republican-leaning than the nation as a whole compared with just 19 states more Democratic-leaning. Because each state has two senators, that means 62 Senate seats (a filibuster-proof supermajority) are Republican-leaning and 38 are Democratic-leaning. But thanks to the Democratic overperformance we\u2019ve been talking about, Republicans hold only a 51-49 majority. Democrats have achieved this by electing a total of 14 senators in red states while holding Republicans to only three senators in blue states. . . .  That\u2019s a glaring Achilles heel for Democrats. One bad election cycle for this class could virtually eliminate red-state Democrats from the Senate in one fell swoop. That would give Republicans something like a 20-seat majority in the upper chamber \u2014 probably too wide for Democrats to overcome in any single future election cycle. . . .  a bad 2018 could condemn Democrats to the Senate minority indefinitely \u2014 at least until something big changes about American political parties."], [34628, "2018-04-30T15:53:35Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.71, 0.03], ""], [47482, "2018-04-29T23:16:25Z", [0.06, 0.21, 0.51, 0.22], ""], [55316, "2018-04-29T19:25:28Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.47, 0.08], ""], [33875, "2018-04-29T18:50:34Z", [0.03, 0.3, 0.6, 0.07], ""], [31802, "2018-04-29T15:43:02Z", [0.01, 0.19, 0.66, 0.14], ""], [529, "2018-04-28T21:16:09Z", [0.01, 0.29, 0.57, 0.13], "Slightly increasing probability for question option #2 for now.

Renacci said that the Trump administration convinced him to make the change.\nRenacci is favored to win the Republican primary. He was endorsed by Mandel, U.S. Sen.

Tester is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for re-election in a state Donald Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.\nFlynn served as national security advisor from January to February 2017, resigning following reports that he did not provide Vice President Mike Pence with accurate information about a conversation that he had with a Russian ambassador concerning sanctions against the country. Prior to serving in the Trump administration, he worked on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and on his presidential transition team.\nIn December 2017, Flynn pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his conversations with the ambassador. He agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as part of his plea deal.\nApril 24 was the filing deadline for candidates running in the U.S. Senate special election in Mississippi. The election will be a nonpartisan race on November 6, 2018, with a runoff on November 27, 2018, if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the general election. The winner will replace Thad Cochran (R), who announced on March 5, 2018, that he would resign his seat on April 1, 2018, due to health concerns. Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant (R) to fill the vacancy on March 21, 2018.\nHyde-Smith is running for election to the seat along with four others: former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy (D), Mayor of Tupelo Jason Shelton (D), Mississippi State Senator Chris McDaniel (R), and Tobey Bartee.\nCandidates running for certain races in Florida must file by noon on May 4. Candidates will be filing for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, judicial offices, state attorney, and public defender. Candidates running for a state executive office, state legislative seat, or a county seat have until June 22 to file. Aside from those races, Florida has the 35th statewide filing deadline in 2018.\nIn the U.S. Senate race, Senator Bill Nelson (D) is seeking re-election. There are also elections for Florida\u2019s 27 members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Florida is currently represented by 11 Democrats and 16 Republicans.\nSenate is looking more competitive so lower my expectations of Republicans and hedging against the Blue Wave."], [57918, "2018-04-27T14:19:15Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [38, "2018-04-27T04:25:31Z", [0.01, 0.13, 0.76, 0.1], "Dem leads in Tennessee Senate race.\nThe Nevada Independent: GOP incumbent Sen.

More on all this below.  Possible outcomes from the 4 toss-ups:\n - Rs win all 4. Currently Predictit.com puts this chance at 4% (assuming all 4 races are independent, which they may not be, but the resulting error is likely to be modest). This will bring them to 53 seats (as they already hold AZ and have lost Nevada per my assumption).\n - Rs win any three. A little arithmetics shows that Predictit customers estimate this probability at 21% (see https://www.predictit.org/Browse/Group/54/Senate). It may go slightly higher if AZ gets more competitive. This will bring Rs to 52 seats. \n - Rs and Ds win 2 seats apiece. This is worth about 37% now and will keep Rs at 51 seats. \n - Rs win 1 seat out of these 4. Probability: 30% Seats: 50 (still a majority as VP Pence gets in play).  \n - Rs win 0 seats (Ds get all 4). This probability is about 8 percent and this is the only outcome that will give Ds a 51/49 majority.   So, with starting assumptions tilted in favor of the Ds, I only get an 8% chance of Ds winning a majority. This is in stark contrast with the consensus here (and on Predictit), which gives them 33-35%. I am willing to round my number up to 10%, but no more. It will be an amazing achievement for Ds to hold to all 3 vulnerable seats in deeply red states (MO/IN/ND), and turn over the red seat in AZ. Possible, yes, but not very likely. The D Senators in MO/IN/ND are all popular, pragmatic, and attuned to local conditions, but they were helped in 2012 by the high turnout of the D base in the presidential elections, which may not be the case in 2018.
