Per an albeit very short bit of research albeit on Wikipedia, an incomplete list of past ethnic and/or religious conflicts in the country would include the following three: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people#Insurgency, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_people#Human_Rights_Violations_Against_Chin_Peoples, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_people#After_Burmese_independence.  So to answer this question, it is not sufficient to focus on the Rohingya alone.  New York Times journalists agree, writing on February 21, 2018, \"A Bombing in Northern Myanmar Signals Strife Beyond the Rohingya.\"  (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/world/asia/-yoma-bank-bombing-in-lashio-myanmar-signals-strife-beyond-the-rohingya.html) That said, the Rohingya conflict/crisis was Myanmar's most massive and most covered by journalists in 2017.  How could this conflict look during this timeframe, between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019? ***First, what happened in 2017?*** 9/14/17 - 389,000 fled in 3 weeks, per https://apnews.com/2d0fe179208f43078fbe7acc4d023322/The-Latest:-EU-demands-Myanmar-halt-violence-on-Rohingya. 1/8/18 - 650,000 fled between August 2017 and January 2018; 87,000 fled earlier, per https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-militants.html. Quote: \u201cThe international aid group Doctors Without Borders estimated last month that at least 6,700 Rohingya, including 730 young children, had met with violent deaths in the month after the military campaign began in August.\u201d 4/17/18 - \"shocking photos,\" per https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/17/world/asia/17reuters-myanmar-rohingya-pulitzer-widerimage.html. Quote: \u201cThe latest crackdown by authorities and Buddhist civilians against the Rohingya population in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine state created a mass exodus of over 600,000 Rohingya children, women and men who fled their homes at the end of 2017.\u201d Another quote: \u201csenior United Nations officials have described the violence against the Muslim Rohingya population as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing.\"\u201d ***Second, what could happen in 2018?  Let's look at timeframe, numbers, means, and political will.*** 11 months remain in the allotted timeframe.  The timeframe is April 1st (today is May 3rd) through March 31, 2019.  That's plenty of time. ~400,000 Rohingya are still in Myanmar, if Wikipedia's sources are to be believed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people.  These numbers far surpass the 1,000 limit in this question; this would suggest there is still plenty of possibility for continued wide-scale conflict during the question's timeframe of 1 April 2018 through 31 March 2019.  In other words, the sheer numbers are still there. There is also a possibility that, depending on how this question is judged, deaths of people who have already been displaced to Bangladesh could count.  (Good Judgment Open Administrators, your thoughts?)  This might cause me to raise my forecast probability by a bit. As far as means, the Burmese military still possesses the same capacity, as far as I can tell. Politically, it's unclear whether building international pressure is having an effect on Suu Kyi, Myanmar's government, and Myanmar's military to stop these conflicts, based on the U.S. Holocaust Museum revoking a prestigious award as recently as March 2018 (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/opinion/myanmar-rohingya.html).  There is her meeting with the UN Security Council (https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-security-council-press-rohingya-solution-envoy-092050596.html), but the analyst at the end notes, \"Yangon-based independent analyst David Mathieson described the visit as \"symbolically quite important\" but doused hopes of any immediate diplomatic breakthrough. He said Suu Kyi's government was grudingly showing \"some semblance of cooperation with the West\" to \"avert further pressure from international justice initiatives\".\"  It appears this is regarded as an internal matter, and I have doubts there will be large swings... this conflict seems more likely to smolder with occasional flareups - as so many conflicts have in Myanmar over the decades - some collection of which may pass the 1,000 person threshold mentioned in this question. From a geoeconomic/macroeconomic standpoint, Myanmar's military and government may not have much to lose by pursuing this conflict.  China is Myanmar's #1 trading partner (http://www.intracen.org/country/myanmar/), and it seems unlikely that China, with simmering ethnic conflicts of its own in certain regions - considered internal matters - would impose any economic penalties over this.  The larger China's economy grows, the less Myanmar has to lose economically. From a geopolitical standpoint, though, Myanmar may depend on the West and some of its other neighbors to counterbalance Chinese influence growing too great.  Western trading partners could be able to create some kind of economic hit if they wanted to, as well.  For this reason, I am guessing the West has some level of leverage, though I assume not a great amount.  But I would have to do more research on that. ***\nOne more wildcard here is measurement.  In a country like Myanmar, how do we know this really happens or not?  How do we avoid false positives or missed alarms?  On balance, my hunch is this would skew towards underreporting.  But I don't really know; that's something else I'd have to research. For now given the history of the Rohingya conflict, it's apparently ongoing nature since its heavy intensification starting in the latter half of 2017, and lack of appearance of a *great* change in political will; ... and given that this is just one of many conflicts or potential conflicts in the country; ... and given a relatively-lengthy 11 months left before 31 March 2019; my forecast will be a relatively high 40%."], [29033, "2018-05-03T02:15:02Z", [0.16], "Myanmar faces numerous internal ethnic conflicts and the government has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to use scorched earth tactics.
