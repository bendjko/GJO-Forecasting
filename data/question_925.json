All listed nations were cited for failure to provide adequate information for proper vetting (by the US government) prior to entry (see: \"other factors\"). Further, the ban provides exceptions (\"waivers\") and some \"430 waivers have been issued\" since the Sept. 2017 order (source: Attorney for the Government Noel Francisco). These arguments seemed to be persuasive (or at least push back against opposing arguments) to most of the court (although the reactions of two judges, Thomas and Gorsuch, were not noted; these two justice traditionally vote conservatively). Justices Roberts and Alito expressed concerned about the court second-guessing the government on \"national security issues\" (re: supporting the injunction against the ban; the court not having access to the same Intelligence [e.g., a group of terrorists entering the country; see Justice Roberts, SCOTUS Blog] that the government has. the implication here is that SCOTUS would be over-stepping its authority and possibly endangering national security by blocking the immigration ban). Other factors: Justice Breyer (normally a \"liberal\" on most rulings) seemed to be appeased by the government's arguments (regarding the granting of waivers) as long as these waivers were not \"window dressing\" (source: SCOTUS Blog). Only justices Ginsberg and Sotomayor argued that the Establishment clause grants the President authority only to \"suspend\" immigration temporarily (in order to give Congress time to pass a law. This implies that any such subsequent law may then be challenged on Constitutional grounds). Likewise, these were the only two justices that objected (in December 2017) to the court's prior upholding of the ban \"while appeals went forward\". (SCOTUS Blog) So, while four justices (Kagan, Kennedy, Ginsberg, Sotomayor) seemed skeptical or critical (based upon their questions) of the government's position, one traditionally liberal Justice (Breyer) appeared to be mollified and only two other traditionally liberal judges appeared to be  steadfast in their opposition to the ban (thus also, Kagan and Kennedy could vote either way), there does not seem to be a solid majority (five justices) in strong opposition to the Sept. 2017 Presidential  Proclamation. These factors persuade me that the court will rule to uphold the ban (but possibly with a provision/stipulation of a time limit)."], [691, "2018-05-17T14:51:05Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.46], ""], [32100, "2018-05-17T13:16:03Z", [0.08, 0.15, 0.77], ""], [172, "2018-05-16T22:21:18Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [53555, "2018-05-16T21:22:55Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], ""], [58346, "2018-05-16T19:04:13Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], ""], [974, "2018-05-16T17:46:54Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [42417, "2018-05-16T06:32:40Z", [0.05, 0.8, 0.15], ""], [30477, "2018-05-15T19:30:53Z", [0.42, 0.26, 0.32], ""], [2965, "2018-05-15T09:06:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [172, "2018-05-14T23:55:34Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [54761, "2018-05-14T18:04:28Z", [0.3, 0.65, 0.05], ""], [50568, "2018-05-14T16:47:59Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [4824, "2018-05-14T16:33:54Z", [0.2, 0.45, 0.35], ""], [691, "2018-05-14T12:33:20Z", [0.0, 0.31, 0.69], ""], [54186, "2018-05-13T16:36:32Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35], ""], [691, "2018-05-12T12:33:10Z", [0.0, 0.31, 0.69], ""], [58255, "2018-05-12T10:05:59Z", [0.03, 0.27, 0.7], ""], [47597, "2018-05-12T03:33:05Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2], "Presidential power in foreign affairs is virtually unlimited \n"], [55834, "2018-05-07T16:32:47Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [19912, "2018-05-07T01:50:34Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [1333, "2018-05-05T15:28:02Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.6], ""], [32258, "2018-05-04T16:47:17Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.95], "https://legaldictionary.net/concurring-opinion/ \"Majority opinions in the course of trying a case, which provides precedent, or a legal standard by which similar cases have been decided.

So, I am no more clear today whether they will avoid the Constitutional question or not. \nIf they opine that the controlling precedent is Mandel, then the court considers whether the ban is facially legitimate and bonafide which means they don't consider Trump's comments regarding Muslims as having any bearing on the case.
