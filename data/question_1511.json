Step 22 covers the aspect of provisional implementation which is where we are. This was a definite priority to stave of WTO terms as the most immediate and costly danger to both sides. With the release of the written procedure and the signatures of both sides in place today this danger is averted. Pressure is off and everyone can take a breath to enjoy (in a COVID conscientious way) their New Years holiday. Now, it is still POSSIBLE that the EU Council will be such enthusiastic eager beavers (after 9 months of gruelling negotiations?) that they'll jump straight into Step 23 in the evening of the 30th December or on New Years Eve (31st December 20) and start \"examining the proposal for conclusion\" and then get drafting the 'saisine' request for approval.  Hence why I can't say its \"impossible\" through the award of a 0% probability forecast. I found an example of the CETA 'saisine' request here (its in French of course but google translate does a passable job): https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2017/2017749DC.htm. Note this is a legalese heavy and quite lengthy document (i.e. likely took some time to prepare). In counter argument to this point, it may be that the Council of the EU have got this request for consent prepared already. But... There are also reports of some pretty egregious \"copy and paste\" errors in the text of the current agreement (e.g. the rather hilarious mentions of Netscape and Mozilla Mail - defunct since the late 90's!: https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1342877839008411648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1342935639663259648%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-55475433) that will need to be cleaned up before the Council are likely to feel ready to present the deal to the EU Parliament under a \"request for consent\". This cleaning up would probably take place in the \"examine the proposal for conclusion\" part of Step 23 (before request for consent is published) and will likely take some time given the high probability of mistakes (like the above) made during the initial rush to publish the provisional document. Given the above and the lack of WTO imperative with the provisional arrangement in place I just don't see the reason or the likelihood that any side (UK or EU) are going to be in a rush to get the request for consent out this side of 2020. Facing a brutal truth for a second, the only people now in a rush for Step 23 to resolve are us forecasters who thought we'd got a massive forecasting (Brier Score) win with our \"against the herd\" (and ultimately accurate) forecasts of the Christmas Eve Trade Deal announcement. Whilst galling to be stumped at the last on what many are calling a \"technicality\" (within a technical question!), our desire for a forecasting win is probably not something that's going to be foremost in the minds of the members of the Council of the EU and not something they're likely to give up their New Years Eve over.

But they've also just agreed to sign said deal and apply it provisionally any way - is there an historical precedence for states signing an agreement (which looks to be ratified by the UK tomorrow) without one side actually agreeing on the legalise of the agreement they've signed?

Now we are on the verge of Step #23 \u2014 \"After both sides sign, the Council examines the proposal for conclusion and sends the agreement to the Parliament for its consent (approval).

A relevant line in Article 218 is \"The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure\" [4]. I think this means it is very likely the European Parliament shall be informed promptly after the signing \u2014 which would count as \"requesting consent\" \u2014 by the European Commission,  almost certainly (?) before 1 January.

Thanks @User01 for a very cogent argument (with CETA precedent) for this happening by the deadline, and to @Wildwood2000 and @samglover97  for their equally well formed posits on the other side. As I see it the counter weights that are trying to tip the argument away from the crowd\u2019s position are: 1. the lack of imperative to rush this through given that WTO trade terms are avoided though application of the provisional agreement (stage 22 which in this case seems to be taking place in parallel / out of sequence to the rest of the process).  This is in with the 27 EU ambassadors agreement as of yesterday (https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ambassadors-approve-brexit-trade-deal/). 2. The UK parliament voting on the 30th December 2020, which appears to be an important aspect of stage 21\u2019s \u201c The two negotiating sides formally sign the agreement\u201d (which in itself is a key precursor to stage 23\u2019s consent request to the EU Parl which we\u2019ve been told by GJ(O) yesterday is the only accepted criteria for question resolution). The fully committed hedgehog / chimp in me desperately wants @User01 to be right, but the \u201csystem 2\u201d fox is steadily talking me around to making a hard correction downwards. With \u201chard Brexit\u201d / WTO terms no longer driving the process, the fundamental question as I see it is \u201cwhat\u2019s the rush to request consent?\u201d. In the HIGHLY unlikely event the vote in the UK parliament goes south on the 30th Dec 20 it would seem easier and less reputationaly damaging for the Commission and the Council of the EU to simply withdraw provisional arrangements than if they were to bust their own process in requesting consent today (without the UK parliament\u2019s ratified signature) and then have to reverse course before the EU Parl (and the world) tomorrow in the event the UK Parliament vote pulls the carpet out from under them. As a final negotiating tactic, and given BJ\u2019s / the ERG\u2019s / the UK Parliaments inherent unreliability and untrustworthiness (see the UK\u2019s Internal Markets Bill fiasco) the EU may feel it far better (and more true to their own process) to hold the sword of Damocles over the UK Parliament\u2019s head until after the UK vote on the 30th Dec 20 by keeping things \u201cprovisional\u201d and only sending the consent request when the UK as a whole is fully signed up to what the BJ government has proposed. To be updated after a read out on what today\u2019s written consent covers and if, as @User01 and @LunaSol suggest, it follows CETA\u2019s precedent.  Being thorough I guess there is also the outside chance that consent could be requested on the 31st December 20 but why would EU Council members spend their New Year\u2019s Eve (https://www.afar.com/magazine/the-strangest-new-years-eve-traditions-around-europe) on this when it could happily wait until the new year (when the EU\u2019s MEPs have already said they\u2019re happy to review and vote in slower time)?

The Council of the EU has agreed to accept the deal.[1]  This means that all stages up until stage 20 in the documented noted in the question [2] have now been completed. For this to be official the Council must agree by written procedure - expected tomorrow.  Yet, as has seemed to have caused some confusion, the question rests on whether consent has been sought to conclude from the Parliament. Below is research I have posted in other comments (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1208354):  The EU-UK process is very similar to the agreement with Canada. One of the texts noted in the question clarifies what happened in the past with CETA [3] and this gives us an insight into the process in general.   The CETA written procedure contained a decision to request the consent of the European Parliament for the conclusion of the agreement.[4] Consent was then granted by the Parliament a few months after it was requested.[5] The only real difference to the process I can see is the competencies of the EU in each deal. CETA was a mixed deal whereas the Commission has chosen Article 217 TFEU as the legal basis for the conclusion of the EU-UK Agreement and deems it EU competence only.  The EU Commission has made clear its thoughts on the way forward in this press release [6] which states:  \"In light of these exceptional circumstances, the Commission proposes to apply the Agreement on a provisional basis, for a limited period of time until 28 February 2021. The Commission will swiftly propose Council decisions on the signature and provisional application, and on the conclusion of the Agreement. The Council, acting by the unanimity of all 27 Member States, will then need to adopt a decision authorising the signature of the Agreement and its provisional application as of 1 January 2021. Once this process is concluded, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK can be formally signed. The European Parliament will then be asked to give its consent to the Agreement. As a last step on the EU side, the Council must adopt the decision on the conclusion of the Agreement.\" To me it is clear that the outlined in the press release brings the agreement to stage 23/24 as detailed by the EU's process document noted in the question.[2] Consent of the EU Parliament will be requested after the agreement is signed subject to provisional application on the EU's side, before the end of December.

The challenge in this question is understanding / interpreting the EU's proposal / consent and ratification process and what parts of it meet the criterion of the question itself.  I just don't know whether an agreement to provisionally apply the trade agreement terms from 1st January 2021 (and therefore avoid WTO trading terms, as appears to be permitted under EU Law) counts as a \"request for consent to CONCLUDE an EU - UK Trade Agreement\". It's the questions use of the word \"conclude\", (alongside some very useful and well informed challenges by @samglover97 and @Wildwood2000) that has made me question my current forecast of 100%. The UK parliament is due to vote on the agreement 30th Dec 20 (likely another blackmail tactic by the BJ Government to force the hands of any rebellious ERG Tories and an internally conflicted Labour Party).  The EU Parliament have ruled out being so rushed in accepting the proposed arrangement and have instead indicated that they will be be looking to formally approve early in 2021.

Seems very unlikely (maybe 1 or 2 percent) that either UK parliament or EU council will turn this down. Opposition in the UK have essentially said they will approve it and while with 27 national government sign offs needed, you would think there is some risk of an issue, everyone has said the negotiating teams have kept everyone informed. However, the time line is very tight. UK parliament set to approve on 30th December. Not clear when EU Governments are approving and that seems to be an \u201cemail\u201d type process, although there was some discussion the Swedish parliament needs to approve it at one point (cannot find anything now).

If they do come to an agreement, it will be sent to Parliament fast, officially resolving the question, but will they get there in the next few days? I think they are going to come to an acceptable agreement on all sides and the current UK talk of preparing for a no deal is just Johnson's way of trying to get the EU to cave a bit. It looks like both sides have made compromises, with the UK reducing its fishing demand from 60% reduction to 35% reduction over 3 years. The EU was asking for 25% over 6 years, so there is still a gap, but manageable. The EU also may have given in a bit on the level playing field talks, allowing for the UK to have more control over its sovereignty without immediate push back or tariffs if the UK does not follow new EU trade laws. It allows for other options other than automatic retaliation. I don't know how this one will go, but with as much as there is at stake, and the recent concessions, I believe they will get there. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/21/boris-johnson-rejects-calls-extend-brexit-talks-2021\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu/brexit-trade-deal-may-be-imminent-senior-eu-source-says-idUSKBN28X0TW\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/uk-and-eu-may-be-on-the-verge-of-signing-brexit-deal.html\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu/no-brexit-trade-deal-yet-as-serious-issues-remain-british-minister-says-idUSKBN28X0TW?il=0\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55422729\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-peston/brexit-trade-deal-between-eu-and-uk-possible-on-wednesday-itvs-peston-idUSKBN28X02R"], [88707, "2020-12-23T15:58:23Z", [0.9], "Positive rumors.

On its face it can be read both ways regarding the prospect for a deal itself, but reading behind the grin I view this as a rather (characteristically) clumsy admission that: 1.  SOMETHING has been decided between both sides at this moment\n2.  That Boris is comfortable enough with the outcome to enjoy the question (rather than shift uncomfortably and stammer out a none-answer as he has done when faced with uncomfortable questions in this and other settings).\n3.  That Boris is now sufficiently unburdened to start enjoying knowing something no one else does and keeping everyone on tenterhooks waiting for his \"big reveal\" at the most politically advantageous moment. Given the obvious discomfort Boris is likely to feel in the (heavily forecasted) event his Brexit project comes crashing down in a burning ball hard, expensive reality, it seems unlikely he'd be this comfortable if this was where Jan 21 was heading.  That said, body language and moments of levity like this are at best minor indicators (particularly with artful liars and flamboyant risk takers like BJ): as such this is not something I'd place much more than circumstantial stock in overall. 6% remains for the possibility that the clowns really are running the circus after all and that all the adults working behind the political pageantry to minimise damage and not sink the UK (and to a lesser extent parts of the EU) into economic doldrums have all quietly left the building.  I still place far more stock in the monetary and financial interests at play in UK Gov and Tory Party thinking in this last Brexit minute than any appeasement of the rapidly fading Brexit supporting base. In UK conservative politics: \"money talks, merit walks\".  And it always has. From a political standpoint: if a deal is struck in the next few days it keeps Boris, the ERG and Farage relevant in criticising the arrangement and the EU at large for many years to come (which will also form their justification for subsequently breaching the arrangement and then further vilifying the EU when sanctions are inevitably applied). If the full hard Brexit happens and its reality is laid bare then what is the point in their existence any longer?  Their finite game is over, the impacts will be real and impossible to sweep under the \"Project Fear\" carpet any longer.  Neither Brexit nor Boris have the kind of rabid, devoted, faith based following in the UK that Trump and all his works have enjoyed state side.

Those voters voted Conservative / Tory because he promised the UK would be 'sovereign' when it leaves the EU. If Johnson accepts an EU deal that gives the EU control over UK fishing, courts or laws, as perceived by both Tory Brexiteers and Red Wall voters, he will have failed and is unlikely to be a) Tory leader in the next election and b) give the Tories a win in the next election. Fishing is a relatively insubstantial part of the UK's economy but is quite symbolic. This and the level playing field are likely to continue being the areas where the gaps are too wide to overcome in the next few days. See https://reut.rs/2KLxenS However, will the closure of the UK / EU borders resulting from the new strain of coronavirus weaken Johnson's resolve? A deal was supposed to announced with the French yesterday evening (Tuesday). France may see this as an opportunity to gain some traction in the haggling over access to UK fishing waters.  Barnier has said today that the UK's latest offer in fishing is unacceptable. France has said it will veto a trade agreement that excludes full access to UK waters. There are Tory MPs that have suggested a no-deal scenario would provide UK with greater leverage in negotiations with EU once the UK has left, i.e. in 2021 or thereafter. Perhaps that is the strategy that Cummings and Johnson put together when it was clear that negotiations were not going well back in October? Either way, time is running out. In principle, there is insufficient time for stage 23 to happen before 31/12/20. Let alone stage 26.

Increased original forecast by 4% on the basis that this seemed to be the more major of the two remaining sticking points and taking this as a sign that the largely political chest beating of UK Gov is now giving way to more rational (and fundamental) economic realities. Interesting the government supportive elements of the UK press (Sky News: https://news.sky.com/video/how-would-a-no-deal-brexit-affect-the-price-of-food-12161677) are today suddenly explaining the painful realities of a no deal in public / consumer focused terms.  Perhaps laying a soft landing ground for \"Bendy Boris'\" (now characteristic) U-Turn on previously held red lines? I'll leave 8% on the table to account for any incompetence / stupidity / hedgehog myopia in the political space that would allow a deal to fail through overplayed intransience (unlikely but not incredible).  The economically irrelevant (0.1%) sticking point of fishing rights is a political football playing almost exclusively to the Farage fan base at this stage (https://www.dw.com/en/uk-fishing-industry-or-brexits-red-herrings/a-51418061).  I don't see this being the hill that Boris will be willing to see his Churchillian persona die on, but if he overplays his now tedious bluff the EU might just decide to make him die on it anyway. COVID impacts have played a major part in forcing the UK's hand (whether they like it or not) which has also increased likelihood of a deal being struck despite rhetoric and media soundbites.  COVID impact and incoming austerity round 2 has pushed the likelihood of a deal up significantly given the obvious economic and fiscal requirement to mitigate a double hit at the same time. I've maintained that BJ and his finite Brexit gameplay cannot afford to have hard Brexit reality visited upon the UK, particularly the parts that will be hardest hit (which ironically mirror much of the UK voting base that most fervently demanded it).  Such a hard truth revelation would sink him and any legacy he might leave behind and is, as an objective factor, a more reliable forecasting indicator than the words of a proven liar and the press releases of a government trying desperately to maintain a poker face with a rapidly weakening hand of cards. Had the UK invested real time and effort into more serious, effective and sincere preparations for no deal Brexit a long time ago (infrastructure projects take time!) then there would be more indicators that the UK was genuinely entertaining no deal as an intentional / desirable outcome and were making best efforts to mitigating the impact of the hard landing.  Again, these are more objective and (to my mind) reliable indicators of intent and will than soundbites and press releases. Human beings communicate in two ways: words and actions.  Words come cheap and are forgotten quickly: actions speak louder. Important to note that the UKs concession on the evolution clause does nothing to reduce the likelihood of the UK diverging from  EU standards in the post deal era: it simply increases the likelihood of a deal before 1st Jan 2021 that the UK may then renege on at some stage(s) in the future. Such a breach  would result in tariffs on divergent UK goods to the EU; driving UK export prices up to the profit of the EU and at the cost of price rises for UK consumers, lost business for UK industries and the further demonization of the EU by an increasingly nationalist UK government and a predictably xenophobic right wing UK press. \n\nChampioned by papers owned by an Australian and a non-domicile UK Lord.

When it comes to populists in general, and to this populist driven political theatre in particular, I believe it more important to weigh the communication of actions far higher than the communication of vitriolic / jingoistic / emotive / patriotic words. I've held off on making any forecast on Brexit until the last few days for precisely this reason.  In the last 48 hours we have seen some significant communicative actions which give us reason to see the UK Governments true position despite (and often in opposition to) the communications strategy they are electing to employ. I have weighted the UK Governments published agreement to not renege on the withdrawal agreement through the Internal Markets Bill or the Finance Bill above all other published statements and press briefings.  This indicates a willingness to compromise and, more importantly, see the UK government (which at this point is inextricable from BJ himself) finally choosing a side.  Which appears not to be the ERG. Whilst the ERG is certainly a vocal force and one the Conservative party find themselves gripped by, their reach into the general public consciousness appears to be waning significantly as Brexit reality approaches and the general unpreparedness of the UK to enter a no deal scenario with stability becomes more and more apparent. BJ, as a modern populist, will be very conscious of the popular mood and, with this decision to remove the law breaking aspects of the IM bill and the FA, appears to be demonstrating a willingness to risk the ERG's wrath as a preferable alternative to not wrecking the UK economy and seeing his flag go down with the sinking Brexit ship.  With this prediction I also see the likelihood of Boris being gone by this time next year significantly increase under cause - effect logic. In counter-argument, I still believe there is an outside possibility (currently 18%) of an \"accidental no deal\" Brexit scenario manifesting where Boris' brinksmanship pushes the negotiations too far and the EU decide that the financial pain they will feel from a no deal is preferable to continuing with fruitless negotiations and political gamesmanship. It still appears possible that they may decide to let the UK taste the reality of no deal in order to bring a more humble and pliable UK to the negotiating table in Q1/2 2021.  In the current economic climate created by COVID and the level of preparedness the EU enjoys to buffer no deal impacts their side however, a deliberately self harming decision from the EU along these lines, or an irreconcilable fait accompli created by the EU's red lines and a suicidally intractable BJ, seems to me to sit within the >20% range.

From the outside, it looks as if the UK government is eager (even desperate) to get anything that is acceptable enough that they can bring back and say it satisfies the requirements of Brexit, and the above example is basically the only example I imagine is likely to be agreed that fits those requirements (provided that it is agreed that some day in the future the UK will get its fish back, subject to further negotiations). However, trying to imagine what is going on on the inside I would observe that: To the extent that Boris Johnson has a political philosophy, it is clear that one of the things it involves is massive amounts of public spending and investment.  I think it is actually a credible policy to essentially borrow massive amounts of money now (interest rates happen to be low) and invest that money in a certain number of key industries (microprocessors, deep learning, etc) in order to give UK companies a head-start in building the economy of the 2030s.

The law was then passed to ensure there would be no extension to the transition period which ends 31st  December 2020.\nAn agreement in principle would have had to be completed by July 30, 2020 for presentation to the EU Parliament to meet the timetable. This date has passed.\nDuring the negotiations,  6 red lines have become apparent that both sides refuse to cross, and they are:\n1)\tFishing. The EU wish to keep the status quo in allowing their fishing industry to have unrestricted  and unfettered access to UK sovereign territory. The UK is insisting on regaining control over its seas and suggesting a yearly negotiated quota system.\n2)\tLevel Playing Field. The EU is demanding that the UK is subjected to European standards after Brexit as in taxation, environment labour rights and state aid. The UK suggests this is not a consideration in any other trade agreement the EU has negotiated and is unacceptable and not conducive to an independent country and reserves the right to diverge.\n3)\tThe European Court of Justice. The EU is insisting that the ECJ is the sole arbiter of contract disputations that may occur. Not acceptable responds the UK as an independent party should be used.\n4)\tCriminal Justice. The EU wants to retain the status quo by retaining the arrest warrant system. The UK disagrees.\n5)\tCultural Objects. With Elgin Marbles in mind compliments of Greece, the EU insists that all cultural objects be returned to their place of origin. The UK disagrees.\n6)\tFinancial Services. The EU insists that the City of London will lose its passport rights to operate in Europe. This is a major industry of the UK and as such is protected by the UK.\nThe EU sees the UK as trying to \u2018cherry pick\u2019 the benefits of belonging to the EU while abrogating actual membership.\nThe UK, after the Brexit referendum, European Election and General election sees it as listening to the will of the people and regaining its sovereignty as an independent country.\nTherefore, I propose a minimum chance of a comprehensive trade agreement being offered to the European Parliament by the Council of the European Union.\nIt is contentious whether a skeletal umbrella agreement is necessary before 1st January 2021 that would be followed up by later deals, which I suggest is the probable outcome. \nConstant observation and potential updating is required for this forecast as pragmatism and politics are in a state of flux.\nhttps://www.euronews.com/2020/06/11/brexit-draft-deal-first-of-many-hurdles-to-a-smooth-exit\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/52937766  https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-trade-talks-what-are-uk-and-eus-red-lines-11944562  https://www.bbc.com/news/51180282\n"], [19127, "2020-07-18T05:00:14Z", [0.32], ""], [1624, "2020-07-18T02:02:55Z", [0.25], ""], [66626, "2020-07-17T23:15:11Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2020-07-17T15:54:14Z", [0.21], ""], [67403, "2020-07-17T08:20:34Z", [0.9], ""], [93502, "2020-07-17T07:45:28Z", [0.2], ""], [94025, "2020-07-16T23:15:03Z", [0.35], ""], [88766, "2020-07-16T22:39:03Z", [0.0], ""], [91675, "2020-07-16T16:08:47Z", [0.05], ""], [93933, "2020-07-16T10:55:41Z", [0.1], "The govt is constructed to feed all power to number 10.

Deep down the EU probably still hopes that sentiment changes enough over time that the effects of us leaving become less extreme, so I doubt they would insist on concluding talks by 1st Jan, more likely to come from us.

With less attractive trade deals on the table due to more protectionist current policies around the world, getting a good FTA with the EU while still leaving becomes the best goal in the circumstances.

As a fourth round of talks between teams of negotiators resumed Tuesday with little hope for a breakthrough on a future trade deal, the bloc's executive arm said a meeting is planned between EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Johnson by the end of June. Daniel Ferrie, the commission spokesperson for EU-U.K. negotiations, said the date and format of the encounter have yet to be determined. The U.K. left the political institutions of the EU on Jan. 31, but remains inside the EU\u2019s tariff-free single market and customs union until the end of the year. That so-called transition period can be extended by two years although a deal to do so has to be made by July 1, according to the legal documents accompanying Brexit. Johnson has repeatedly said he will not extend the transition period beyond Dec. 31.\n"], [86678, "2020-06-02T16:00:55Z", [0.95], ""], [88954, "2020-06-02T14:41:50Z", [0.4], ""], [85635, "2020-06-02T14:33:02Z", [0.55], ""], [88766, "2020-06-02T13:35:15Z", [0.07], ""], [87448, "2020-06-02T11:11:10Z", [0.09], ""], [88766, "2020-06-01T21:25:13Z", [0.11], ""], [31275, "2020-06-01T15:16:49Z", [0.19], "https://www.businessinsider.com/brexit-trade-talks-eu-uk-negotiations-fail-transition-period-2020-5\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-28/u-k-may-have-given-up-on-brexit-deal-eu-s-trade-chief-says\nIf no progress this week then lowering more.\n"], [87448, "2020-05-31T20:09:11Z", [0.12], ""], [19127, "2020-05-31T16:57:11Z", [0.16], ""], [66626, "2020-05-30T22:19:11Z", [0.14], ""], [88013, "2020-05-30T19:28:39Z", [0.05], ""], [88083, "2020-05-30T16:28:36Z", [0.12], ""], [1333, "2020-05-30T14:18:40Z", [0.01], ""], [88885, "2020-05-30T13:24:02Z", [0.8], ""], [38094, "2020-05-30T02:49:22Z", [0.01], "Thumping and shouting do not for a compromise make."], [88869, "2020-05-30T01:45:22Z", [0.8], "I'm making this forecast based on the high likelihood of No.10 pushing as hard as it always has under Johnson to \"get Brexit done\".

Frost must prove that GB is serious about not concluding an agreement and Barnier (obviously has to respond) but must show that EU is united and no 'cherry picking' a la Tusk. I still think a deal remains the best outcome for both but ironically fishing rights seems to be the big dispute for an industry so small (<0.1% UK gdp). For whatever reason fishing seems to really cut through to UK audiences and so any return to status quo would be exploited by Farage et co. as a betrayal of the people. (interesting twitter thread on UK proposals from very well connected source on EU side  : https://twitter.com/tconnellyRTE/status/1265276233694101510). This government markets itself as \"The peoples government\" so to concede drastically on Fish would do them no favours. Difficult to adjust forecast atm due to the precarious situation of Dominic Cummings (DC) but *as I type* I do not expect DC to leave No. 10. DC and vote leave gang are very much the driving force behind no extension and as such think is < 5%. The idea of a bare bones deal still seems achievable if UK moves on level playing field conditions (LPF) & seemingly total denial of EU fleet access to UK waters. If they want to conclude a trade deal LPF conditions will play a part in that but how much clearly up for negotiation. Really think a lot of people are undercooking the likelihood of a deal. It is important to remember that, whilst forced by UK law at the time, all the hot air last time concluded in an agreement. Phase 1 all hinged on the NI protocol. Essentially Johnson and Varadkar sat down in a room and sorted it. Phase 2 will be more complex due to the interests of various parties in fish but a deal is achievable if UK accept that access to EU markets means they cannot expect to deny EU fleet any access at all to UK waters. June talks will be V significant as is last opportunity for an extension to be granted. When June concludes the outcome will become binary , deal or \u201cno-deal\u201d.

It took an average of 6.3 years to negotiate these deals. The current health crisis means that negotiations will happen via video conference for at least the next few months. The timetable has not changed but this will probably impact the efficiency of the talks. The big disagreement at this stage is the enforcement of a/the \u2018level playing field\u2019. The EU wants to maintain the integrity of the single market and prevent unfair practice. They want disputes to be handled by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This is a red line from the UK\u2019s perspective, remaining subject to the ECJ means they are rule takers and undermines Brexit. There are solutions to this problem such as dynamic alignment, but this is not very popular with the UK as it would still involve the ECJ. This may be the brick wall leading to a no/WTO trade deal. The British Government has made its position very clear about not having an extension [1]. Currently British law does not allow the request for an extension. Both of these points need to be taken with a grain of salt (the withdrawal agreement negotiations). The UK has warned the EU that they could ditch talks in June if a clear framework for a free trade deal is not in place [2]. A tough approach may increase the chances of an agreement. But, the chances of a deal will diminish if negotiations are ditched. A full agreement before Jan 1st 2021 seems unlikely. A partial agreement is much more probable. If a full agreement is not in place coming up to the deadline, there will be an incentive from both sides to push through a smaller deal consisting of everything they DO agree on. Especially because of the health crisis and economic slowdown. However, the \u2018nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\u2019 mantra will probably surface once again due to \u2018linkage\u2019 [3], reducing the chances of a partial agreement. Overall, negotiating a deal like this in 10 months is extremely difficult, unprecedented. The health crisis makes it even more so. However, A partial agreement is certainly possible and could come at the very last minute. Criticism is very welcome!

That gets you to focus on Boris Johnson (BJ) quite quickly. My end point first is that I believe BJ will leave the EU without a deal. He has no love nor affinity for the EU at all. Meaning he can compromise a little if a deal can be made but does not care to compromise a lot if there are wide differences (which there currently are). BJ makes note of his interest in Pericles from his passion on ancient greek studies. I wondered if this was even a ruse as BJ is so open about it but it appears genuine I can cannot yet see any other ancient characters that we could draw upon to understand his thinking applied to Brexit (certainly none Italian). Much discussion also noted around time lost to the Covid pandemic. I believe BJ will justify 2 weeks delay he and David Frost were out of action but no more. For example 6 months is not proportional to the delay this year.  \nThe Israeli and Chruchill test that many pundits site as more modern day idols for BJ do not make me any more confident of a capitulation by BJ. The British Bulldog mentality is alive and well. BJs legacy will not be served by listening to anyone in the EU. Looking tough with the EU does no harm in terms of keeping Faraday and alike at bay either which is important electorally as BJ learned in observing fellow Oxford alumni David Camerons demise.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullingdon_Club.    \nSo are there forces in the UK that can make BJ rethink or at least be more flexible? I do not believe so. The civil service is being told to do as told or resign. It is part of the elected UK Government's mandate to push its agenda through the civil service knowing there will be friction and not caring to date about the push back. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/boris-johnson-britain-dominic-cummings/607363/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=yahoo&utm_campaign=yahoo-non-hosted&yptr=yahoo\nDavid Frost another Oxford graduate from the 80s has worked with BJ before. He keeps popping up around BJ so apparently one of the inner circle. I cannot see how he will be able to sway his appointer to any great extent in Brexit negotiations. \nI have left 5% for the Northern Irish to have their way this year as not much else will compel BJ and Co around Downing Street to capitulate. If they start up again then who knows. Europe\n20+ countries leaders that all need to agree? While dealing with their own issues and many with internal EU scepticism.  \nThe British can only agree to a Brexit deal if the EU drops ALL legal handcuffs on the UK (currently stated by them and unlikely). I am far removed from events but it feels like the EU expect this to be a negotiation. I do not believe UK leadership fear a hard Brexit so it is not a traditional negotiation at all where you can horse trade a lot. The timing is more critical to the UK than the outcome (ie no extension).   \nGreat German article on Brexit as I see Germany as central to events this year. https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-agony-of-brexit-for-us-germans . Long story short it is arguable Greece should have left the EU with its own currency 10 years ago, devalued it and printed itself out of debt. The Pandemic is going to force a number of EU countries like Italy and Spain in particular to spend big now and then pay back later (in the EU = Austerity) or just QE print it (out of the EU) or at least redefine EU economic policy this year at the expense of the North (Germany) which they now might be able to with the UK gone. Germany no longer assured of previous traditional voting blocks on economic issues with the UK gone and now looking at strong opposition from the south on more pressing local economic matters than Brexit. A divided, busy, unfocused or hesitant EU being a weakened one to cut a tough deal with a belligerent UK government hellbent on strict deadlines. In fairness to the current UK leadership they have been unwavering on their timeline in the past and only curtailed in the UK parliament which they no longer will be unless by choice.  Note\nI have spent 90% of my time looking at UK factors. Partly because I am an anglophile and you get google searches that way and partly the UK should be the more interested party as they are the smaller one with 50% of their exports to the EU.  \nI did not expect to have to read about BJ as much as I did. He is an interesting character and not always easy to read. In fairness I never tried before either. \nThere may well be forces in Europe wanting a deal more than I know also. I am not aware but I am all ears if others can suggest.  \nI would increase the probability of a deal if I could see parties investing time and resources into a deal, EU countries individually pushing EU negotiations for one and the EU dropping EU legal channels for disputes or the UK agreeing to them in some instances.

Naturally, as this is a matter that will make or break the EU's entire survival, the EU would do anything it can to discourage more states from leaving the EU. Thus, while forcing a hard Brexit would hurt it economically, we would assume that the EU would need to hardline, as other nations who are skeptical of the EU would see how costly it would be to leave their experiment, and would be compelled to stay with the Union. Plus, Brexit has been going on for years now, and it would seem that given the reduced coverage of Brexit, people are less interested in saving the UK, and are more willing to say \"good riddance.\" Thus, before recent events, I would say that there was a good chance, probably a 66% chance, that the trade agreement would be concluded. However, this ignores the elephant in the room, the one thing we can't seem to ignore these days, the pandemic that has currently plagued the world. Unfortunately, globalism and multilateralism, to values I personally believe in and I will acknowledge may bias my ability to accurately predict events, are under fire more than ever before (https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/03/15/globalization_may_be_the_greatest_victim_of_covid-19_504495.html). This is a \"problem without passport\" and thus requires international consensus, but there are many who wish to blame increased globalization for this problem occuring in the first place. Naturally, one would assume that the forecoming rise of populism would mean that the EU and even EU skeptics would use this opportunity to double down on finalizing the agreement. They would want to end the relationship between the EU and the UK sooner rather than later. However, I now feel that the economic consequences of leaving the EU are now too severe for the entire world. The stock market is seeing multiple record breaking drops due to a loss of faith in the American government's ability to handle the crisis (https://www.vox.com/2020/3/16/21182341/dow-jones-biggest-point-drop-coronavirus-3000). Meanwhile, unemployment rates in the world's largest economy are reaching levels not seen since WWII (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/31/824520791/economy-on-lockdown-jobless-rate-could-be-highest-since-wwii). This is just mentioning one country who happens to be a significant trading partner to both the UK and the EU. The world is headed to economic turmoil, and at this point Brexit may only worsen things. So instead of significantly guaranteeing that Brexit will finally come to an end by next year, I am giving this a 50% shot.  Now to apply Bayesian Theorem, P(A|B)= P(B|A)* P(A) /P(B)\nA, B\t=events. Where A is hard Brexit and B is the economic ramifications of Coronavirus \nP(A|B)=probability of A given B is true, or what we are looking for\nP(B|A)=probability of B given A is true, or the probability that  we will have a hard Brexit due to the economic ramifications of coronavirus (50%)\nP(A), P(B)=the independent probabilities of A and B (66% for a Hard Brexit and a 75% chance that there are economic ramifications) meaning that P(A|B)= (.5)(.66)/(.75)=.44 or a 44% chance that the Council of the European Union will request the consent of the European Parliament to conclude a European Union-United Kingdom trade agreement\n"], [14107, "2020-03-31T17:17:52Z", [0.13], ""], [86567, "2020-03-31T13:51:34Z", [0.8], "A hard Brexit is in nobody's interest, while an extension is not politically acceptable for Boris's lot, who are \"getting Brexit done\".

This item also remains a top priority on the list of negotiations between the two entities. However, PM Johnson's more hard-line, right-wing stance is likely to result in stagnation of negotiations as the UK seeks the most favorable terms possible. If the entire Brexit process has taught us anything, the EU is unlikely to accept being bullied by the UK. Therefore, negotiations are likely to stall frequently and delay progress in finalizing any deal before 1 January 2021.  It is worth noting that the UK can pursue bilateral trade deals with other countries (US, Canada, etc) during this process and is not entirely reliant on a trade deal being finalized on anything but favorable terms. Trade does not become impossible without a deal as the UK can still trade with the EU based on WTO rules (even if temporarily). However, I leave much room for an improvement in negotiations as there is potential for a \"temporary trade deal\" to be struck between the two parties that more or less serves as an \"trade extension\" in lieu of its political equivalent (something that PM Johnson has sworn not to undertake, let alone its Parliament). Therefore, there is a greater chance of a temporary deal being struck that, on its face, looks more favorable to the UK while maintaining many of the existing rules in place today.

On 1) whilst possible, when observing the mandates on both sides there is a pathway to a deal and imo there isn't much incentive for HMG to be intransigent about negotiations given their desire to move on from the debate. However problems over ECJ jurisdiction, fishing and even Gibraltar could make an agreement difficult and let's not forget that HMG is not asking for much from the EU. Walking away from what the current HMG objective is in comparison to no agreed future relationship isn't actually as big a difference as what it would've been under May's deal for example.  On 2) it is legislated into UK law that the transition is not extended so it would be difficult (although not impossible) to reverse this position but it'd be v difficult for Boris to do so.  This brings me to the conclusion that it is more probable than not that a deal will be concluded. There have already been small hints at areas of compromise and rhetoric often hides the detail. Boris ended up making concessions to conclude the WA as did the EU. Both sides will want to move on swiftly (Boris to end the Brexit argument and EU because of MFF negotiations amongst other things). There is still a good chance of no agreement because there is less to lose for both sides this time and there seems to be disagreement about interpretation of PD but these are not significant enough to outweigh the probabilities.
