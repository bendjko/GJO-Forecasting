Cory Gardener is deeply unpopular in Colorado and not just with Democrats. He is not a favorite of Republicans in general, seen as being too milquetoast, inauthentic. Additionally Republicans in the state are politically dejected as they have watched Colorado become what is essentially a blue state.  I believe most Republicans in the state and nation assume Gardener will lose his seat. There will be little zeal, even within Colorado, for Gardener's reelection I believe; which will translate broadly to comparatively light campaign contributions, from small donors, PACS or even the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, even though Gardener was chair as recently as 2019. Democrats on the other hand are eagerly looking at Gardener's seat. I believe the DNC likely assume they will pick the seat up in 2020, which is one of three potential wildcards here.  1) DEMOCRAT COMPLACENCY: If the DNC and Democrats in general become too complacent because they assume they will unseat Gardener they could definitely wind up surprised in November. I believe Democrat complacency could reduce Democrat turnout in November by several percentage points, and possible swing the election when combined with other factors. It is not that Democrats need to pour substantial resources into Colorado to defeat Gardener, but a well funded, motivated and mobilized Republican base could return Gardener for another term, especially if Democrats nominate an unknown quantity. Which brings us to wildcard #2.  2) DEMOCRAT NOMINEE: The individual Democrats nominate for Senate in Coloradoan 2020 could also alter the vote by several percentage points. For better or worse we live in a society whose politics is heavily predicated on the concept of individual celebrity. Donald Trump is not the cause of this, he is merely the great benefactor of a culture that views celebrity as a form of modern day currency and competency. More well known candidates inherently draw greater attention, creating feedback loops with media and driving larger voter turnout, both for and against. Donald Trumps fame inherently draws a high degree of voter turnout and most voters who vote for Trump will also vote for Cory Gardener. But the same is not inherently true for Democrats. A voter who goes to vote specifically against Trump may not inherently vote for Gardener's Democrat opponent. I believe name recognition will matter this November in Colorado with former Governor Hickenlooper offering the strongest odds against Gardener. 3) ECONOMY/CORONAVIRUS: The obvious wildcard in all of this is the state of the economy in Nov. 2020 and the nature of coronavirus. Barring some sudden and dramatic upward shift in both the economy the trajectory of coronavirus I believe Gardener's preexisting unpopularity in Colorado will make it virtually impossible for him to be reelected. However, if coronavirus miraculously goes away over the summer, we do not have any additional spikes in cases, and the global/national/state economies all ramp back it will not mean Gardener is likely to win reelection, only that those factors will not also be drags upon his incumbency. There is a small, albeit real, chance that coronavirus could cause such a cataclysmic collapse of the global/national/state economies that a third party candidate could manage to ride the crisis into office."], [87809, "2020-05-04T18:51:44Z", [0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [87089, "2020-05-04T17:21:47Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [68240, "2020-05-04T16:58:01Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [36915, "2020-05-04T16:14:58Z", [0.89, 0.11, 0.0], "I've been watching the Polls, but I also think that Hickenlooper was a popular Governor, who was able to work across the aisle in CO.
