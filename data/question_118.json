Forsyth concluded saying, \"Accepting the tenets of realism is an act of humility --a rare commodity in international affairs but a useful one nonetheless. American policy makers will eventually come to it, even if they do so reluctantly...Realism is in our future.\" I have mentioned this in the past and will again here...Global Trends 2030 makes it clear in several places that there will be no global hegemony in the future. Analysis; American mood is finished with global intervention. Americans forked over trillions of tax dollars to support nations abroad for seemingly failed foreign policy intervention. The candidates that have embraced a non-intervention foreign policy (Sanders) and putting Americans first (Trump) have interestingly done well in the primaries. Candidates that can embrace a degree of Realism and have empathy for the falling living standards of Americans will be the next POTUS. What is more interesting is Global Trends and Forsyth both seem to have forecasted a Trump like candidate but neither forecasted Trump.

It's more bullish on HRC than the GJ consensus[2] but less so than my own forecast. So what gives?  Not sure. HRC is currently favored 95/5 in California and is expected to take away about two-thirds of the delegates there[3][4]. These numbers have been pretty steady for more than a month. Nationally (for all that's worth), HRC is running about 10 points ahead of Bernie - and has been since mid-February[5]. HRC is still about 8% ahead of the pace she needs to maintain in order to get a majority of the delegates, while Bernie is about 8% behind that pace. Moreover, HRC has never been below that pace, and Bernie has never been above it[6].  So what could go wrong? Lemme see: (a) HRC dies or has to pull out of the race because of health (grizzly but possible nonetheless).\n(b) A scandal pulls down HRC or threatens the viability of her campaign.\n(c) Bernie defies all logic and manages to win more delegates than HRC.\n(d) The super delegates defy all logic and go with Bernie.\n(e) Something else I haven't thought of. As a 68-year-old American woman, HRC has a 0.013261 probability of dying within 12 months[7]. The fact that she's white and wealthy drives the probability down. The mortality rate among black women of about this age is about 33% higher than among white women[8], and average life expectancy for Americans with her level of wealth is about 10% lower than Americans with the median level of income[9]. So let's just call the likelihood that HRC will die before the convention 1%/4, since it's only 3 months away. We can double that to 0.005 as, intuitively, the probability that she would suffer a serious but not (immediately) fatal illness during that time is about the same.  What about a scandal? Last time I thought (somewhat) carefully about this, I decided that there was abut a 2% chance that HRC would be indicted by the DoJ before the election. @Kaizen has pointed to a recent piece from CNN in which we are told, \"The investigation is still ongoing, but so far investigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clinton willfully violated the law the U.S. officials say\"[10]. That doesn't quite put the kibosh on this possibility, but leaves me fairly confident that something around 2% is correct. Even if HRC were to be indicted, she wouldn't go down without a fight. I'd guess that there's about a 50/50 chance she'd hold until she had the nomination in hand, especially if she already has a majority of the pledged delegates when (and if!) the scandal breaks. Of course, this isn't the only possible source of scandal. But it's pretty unlikely that a politician whose been under intense scrutiny for 25 years would be vulnerable to some new scandal out of the blue. And even if R operatives have a trick up their sleeves, they're likely to wait until the general election to use it.   Bernie currently as 1,417 pledged delegates. That is an incredible accomplishment for anyone, and especially for someone without much experience on the national stage (Senatorial back-benching doesn't count) and for someone who is pretty far from the Democratic median voter of the last few decades. But he needs 2,026 pledged delegates to win a majority before the convention; i.e., he needs 609 of the remaining 913 pledged delegates. That's a little less than 67%. Bernie has received 67% or more of the available delegates in 8 of 44 primary contests: Vermont, Kansas, Democrats Abroad, Idaho, Utah, Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington. Bernie doesn't have to win 67%-or-more in *each* of these remaining 13 primaries, since he might get (for example) get much more in some states to pick up on some of the slack in the others. That's a good thing too because (on a natural way of thinking about this) his odds of that are something approaching (8/44)^13 = 1/23,729,300,000! But certainly the odds of this happening are very, very low - especially given the above mentioned 19-to-1 advantage for HRC in the biggest source of pledged delegates, CA. So...Bernie's odds here aren't 0, but they can't be higher than 1%. Call it half a percentage point to be safe. As for (d), nope[11]. And I can't speak to (e) since I don't yet know what it might be. Suggestions? Anyway, the math looks like this 0.5%+1%+0.5%+0%+I-don't-know = 2%. I'll call this 2% until someone gives me a good reason to hike it up on the basis of something I haven't thought of. So, yeah, I was a little too bullish about HRC, and I'm fixing that.  BTW, it's worth point out that both (a) and (b) apply to Bernie as well. Bernie's chances of dying in the next 12 months are 0.033997, though a bit lower because he too is a wealthy and white[12]. So 1% is not a *crazy* number to put on the possibility that he won't make it to the convention - heaven forfend. Could he be stung by a scandal? Sure. He hasn't received that much scrutiny, by the standards of 2016. The odds are surely not 0. But this is all parenthetical. \n\n--- [1] http://predictwise.com/politics/2016-president-democratic-nomination\n[2] https://www.gjopen.com/questions/118-who-will-win-the-democratic-party-nomination-for-the-us-presidential-election\n[3] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/california-democratic/\n[4] http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-california-democratic-presidential-primary\n[5] http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary\n[6] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/\n[7] https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html - I know I've used this table before, but I just can't help myself.\n[8] http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Life.html\n[9] http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000178-How-are-Income-and-Wealth-Linked-to-Health-and-Longevity.pdf\n[10] http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/fbi-interviews-huma-abedin-clinton-aide/index.html\n[11] http://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11597550/superdelegates-bernie-sanders-clinton\n[12] https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html"], [691, "2016-05-06T12:05:41Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [24517, "2016-05-06T11:55:31Z", [0.49, 0.0, 0.51], "I update my prediction from 48% to 51% (actually 50.2) due to the possibility of a contested convention (CC) by 2.2 points due to the following facts regarding new information about primary: \n-West Virginia upcoming primary is open also to residents who are not registered with another party (rules that have helped Sanders run up the score in other states) \n-According to PPP, Clinton holds only a slim lead among Democrats\n-Sanders is winning 56 percent of the independent vote\n-Clinton received anger from many residents from a  recent comment concerning coal miners when she promised to \u201cput coal miners out of work\u201d \n-Regression toward the mean: last primary with \"Clintons\" faired stronger the first time.\n-West Virginia is rural and white, and has some of the lowest incomes in the country, which benefits Sanders.\n-5 upcoming primaries are OPEN or MIXED, which allows for Sanders to obtain advantage\n-Montana (OPEN voting), is 77% white, and 70% above 18yo\n-Puerto Rico (OPEN voting), has 67 delegates and superdelegates, 53% population in the age of 18-50, 77% are white; they want good medical care, PR is experiencing a major financial problems; 4 out of 7 DNC superdelegates have not endorsed a candidate;\n-Virgin Islands has 3 superdelegates, and no endorsed candidates;\n-New Jersey is MIXED and has 167 delegates, and 3 out of 8 democratic superdelegates have not endorsed a candidate.\n-Due to different campaign strategy, Sanders has gained favor from non-white voters from 9 to 27% (Feb 2016); This may benefit him in \n-Virgin islands (OPEN) which is predominantly non-white and have 12 delegates.\ngiving each an arbitrary, conservative .1 point, I see 2.2 points increase.

More importantly, there's really little chance (ca. 3%) that Bernie could close the gap before HRC arrives at a majority of the total number of delegates. If I'm reading the data aright, there are 4,051 hard hard delegates available, and 2,173 (give or take a few) remaining today. Bernie would need to win more than 57% of these remaining delegates to get a majority, while HRC would need win only 43%[b]. That should be a walk in the park for her. The only other reasons I can see that HRC would not win the nomination are as follows: 1. a new major HRC scandal and 2. something happens (this is a euphemism, plainer talk in a moment) to HRC. A new major scandal at this stage seems unlikely given that HRC has been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades. Democratic voters have largely made their peace with known Clinton scandals (whatever their probative value might be - low I think, but that's just me). It remains to be seen whether general election voters have too, but that's another matter. As for HRC's health, well, I don't mean to be ghoulish, but the thousand natural shocks to which the flesh is heir might seem relevant here, and we'll all shuffle off this mortal coil eventually. (Others share curiosity about this, e.g., @Promethean.) But just how likely is it that health might be an issue? HRC was born in 1947, so she's currently 68. The probability that a woman of this age will die within the next 12 months is (precisely!) 0.013261, as it so happens[c]. And HRC only has to make it through July 28 to be nominated (I know this is _ghastly_, but I can't stop now), so we can knock that number down about one third to 0.004420333. And when you take into consideration that HRC is white, has a very high level of wealth and income, has spent most of his life in positions of power, doesn't (to my knowledge!) smoke or use hard drugs, etc. the demographic factors make the probability of her body temperature failing to be in the neighborhood of 98.5 degrees rather than the ambient temperature of whatever location her body might be occupying in late July is so close to zero that we can just forget about the whole damn thing[d][e]. Sure, an injury (God forbid!) with results short of death could also prevent her from being nominated too, but offhand I'd say that the likelihood of this sort of thing is even less salient. And thinking too hard about this is gross, so just forget it. -- [a] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/democrats/\n[b] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016\n[c] https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html\n[d] http://www.jstor.org/stable/20062079\n[e] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62373/"], [493, "2016-03-16T15:20:35Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Affirming prior."], [13884, "2016-03-16T14:49:46Z", [0.98, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [13884, "2016-03-16T14:46:15Z", [0.97, 0.0, 0.03], "she killed it in florida"], [15220, "2016-03-16T14:45:12Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [9755, "2016-03-16T14:42:59Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20582, "2016-03-16T14:21:15Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20608, "2016-03-16T14:15:54Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], "Reducing Sanders's probability after his poor result in the March 15th primaries.

While there are noted differences in the timing and concentrations of different nominating contests across the states and the number of candidates among other things, these are the closest comparisons that I can make at this time.  Looking back at these contests (and omitting the 2012 Democratic primary due to an unchallenged incumbent), it becomes clear that at the beginning of March, the candidates will the most delegates went on the win the nomination. With Super Tuesday today and the polls looking clearly in Clinton's favor, it seems that this pattern could follow. However, adjusting this initial estimate to factor in the current circumstances (Sanders' momentum and popularity among young and white voters being one), I would not totally rule out Sanders.  For this reason, I think the adjusting from the initial comparison class leads me to 70% Clinton and 30% Sanders. This will need to be adjusted as the primaries continue.

Historically, Hillary has been favored among Latino and minority voters while Bernie controls much of the young voter population. Though the primaries and caucuses have been back and forth as of lately, Hillary\u2019s history and experience within the white house gives her the decisive edge. \nH Clinton\u2019s recent performances have seemed to given her a huge boost in the democratic race going into the future. As of February 23rd, every major poll has Clinton up by at least ten points. In addition, about 6/10 primary voters view Hillary as the ideal candidate to represent the Democratic Party. \nA Due to the latest information on the race and with Hillary\u2019s convincing victory, the latest prediction of 57% Hillary against 43% Bernie still holds. Bernie can easily slide towards the 50% range, but at the moment, Hillary is and continues to be in the drivers seat heading into March. \nM Recent polls continue to favor Hillary, and her 52.6% to 47.3% victory over Sanders in Nevada gave her much-needed delegates for the race to come. Hillary has won 502 delegates compared to Bernie\u2019s 70, however, 2,383 are needed to win. But with a strong start and likely future momentum, it would be no surprise to see Hillary pull through with a victory. \nP The primaries are still an ongoing process, however logic will lead us to believe that Hillary will ride off of the much needed energy from her last two victories into the spring and certainly compete in the race against Sanders. \nS Large questions to answer: Can Hillary win over young voters, in addition to more males? Clinton has been seriously lagging within these demographics, and if she can find a way to resonate them, she will be a clear frontrunner for the nomination. Also, will she ever get over her shaky past as secretary?\nK The single most key player is Bernie Sanders, who seems as confident as ever to compete against Hillary in the future. The democratic candidate seems unfazed by the last two primaries, and believes he can be victorious in the primaries to come. \nN Delegates are won proportionally based on the vote counts in congressional areas, and 2,383 are needed to win, so Clinton will need some more decisive victories in order to haul in large quantities of delegates. South Carolina will be a key area for her to bolster her lead.\nO One thing that is important to note is that Bernie Sanders has been allotting most of his time to super Tuesday, which features 11 primaries and is arguably the most important part of the upcoming election. Will Bernie make a serious run at Hillary by winning massive amount of delegates in March? \nW Hillary needs to continue to ride out her momentum within her campaign, as she is beginning to rack up more and more support as we get deeper into the year. If Bernie wants to make a serious run, he needs to continue to attack Clinton\u2019s credibility as secretary, her super PAC, her paid speeches, her views on the Iraq war, as well as her shaky past with regards to civil rights. \n"], [11885, "2016-03-01T20:19:15Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10924, "2016-03-01T20:16:33Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [20255, "2016-03-01T20:09:32Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [20693, "2016-03-01T19:10:57Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [2, "2016-03-01T18:58:59Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [18605, "2016-03-01T18:49:07Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [915, "2016-03-01T17:40:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Super Tuesday will be the nail in Bernie's coffin (sorry).

The numbers aren't there. As in, people aren't voting, numbers are WAY down compared to 2008. Some of that is due to the fact that the DNC seems to have utterly failed to properly train volunteers, and have made voting as difficult as possible. The caucus system in particular is just rife with stories of people leaving because of confusion, ridiculously long lines, and misinformation; volunteers doing illegal things (i.e. Iowa not recounting all the Hillary votes to see if anyone had left, Nevada letting people vote with registering, both caught on video), locations that were difficult to locate, and too few people on the ground with little to no training. This favors a particular candidate, whether it is intentional or not. And it most certainly favors Hillary in the primary (and, if I may say so, the Republicans in the general - I think if Hillary is nominated the DNC may find that they could lose everything due to independents and half of their voter base's apathy or outright loathing for Hillary). But Bernie's widespread support among younger voters isn't translating into getting them out to vote. And despite the ground that he is making up among minorities (Hispanic community in particular), it may not be enough quantity or fast enough. The African-American community in particular showed in Nevada that they are still serving as Clinton's firewall, overwhelmingly voting for her, almost as overwhelmingly as they voted for Obama in 2008. And unfortunately Super Tuesday is practically designed to destroy Bernie's momentum - overwhelmingly Hillary-loving states with large black populations. If he can't get out his support (and he has plenty, basically neck and neck with Hillary at this point), and right now the numbers show he simply isn't getting people to vote the same way Obama did, then he's probably doomed. I still think he has a decent chance, as literally every day that passes he moves a little up and she moves a little down in terms of the polls - but in the caucuses and primaries its simply not translating to the tangible numbers needed and the narrative is probably not going to be pretty after Super Tuesday, despite the fact that there will still be tons of voting to be done people may simply go back to assuming that the Clinton coronation that this race was always meant to be is moving forward as intended and not bother voting.

There are many factors that contribute to Hillary having a better chance at winning the nomination for president. First, Hillary has the backing of the democratic party's establishment, Wallstreet, many superpacs, news sources and almost any other source of wealth that is affiliated with the democrats. Additionally,  Hillary Clinton has already locked up half the Democratic superdelegates in Nevada and South Carolina before the first votes are cast in either state. The former secretary of State has won public support from half of South Carolina\u2019s six superdelegates and three of Nevada\u2019s eight superdelegates. Bernie Sanders has secured only one, a Democratic national committeewoman from Nevada. The superdelegates are made up of Democratic lawmakers and party leaders who can cast a vote for the party\u2019s nominee during the Democratic National Convention. They have the freedom to back whoever they want, and are not bound by the results in their states. Currently, according to recent polls, Hillary Clinton has a 61% to 34% chance of winning the South Carolina primary, mostly because she has a large amount of support from African Americans in this area. In Nevada, however, the two candidates are basically at a tie of 50% each. Moving forward, it is somewhat likely that Bernie Sanders will gain more support in Nevada because they were hit the hardest from the financial crisis of 2008 and Bernie Sanders campaign has been centered around breaking up the big banks. Some things that could change my prediction in the foreseeable future would be the results of the SC and NV elections. According to MSNBC, Bernie Sanders has employed over 240 staffers to work on his ground game, and about 80& of them are focusing on predominantly African American areas. If Bernie can effectively use his ground game to persuade blacks to vote for him, and somehow pull a upset victory in South Carolina, the chances of Hillary winning the national election will definitely drop. However, despite Bernie gaining momentum, it is still a long shot that he can pull an upset in South Carolina. Other factors that could play a role in Hillary winning the election are what happens if she is indicted for her email controversy, but it is unlikely that that will happen. Nationally, Hillary has a lead over Bernie of 49 to 33%. There are still a good amount of undecided democratic voters in the country, and how the next couple of debates and primary's turnout could have a major impact on each candidates chances of winning the democratic primary. However, in 2008, we expected Hillary to win SC but she lost in an upset to president Obama, so an upset by Bernie in this state is not out of the question, If it does occurr, his chances of winning the democratic nomination will dramatically increase. nevertheless, since Hillary has all the cards stacked in her favor, I predict that she has a 57% chance of winning while Bernie has a 43% chance of winning the democratic primary.

But note that Nevada (80% white) is racially somewhat similar to New Hampshire (96% white)[2], and Sanders has been doing disproportionately well with white voters (or disproportionately poorly white non-white voters, if you like)[3]. So his movement in Nevada might not have far reaching implications for other states that are less heavily white.  Fun fact: The whitest states in the union are Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, West Virginia, Iowa, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Kentucky, and North Dakota[4]. In each, the percentage of the population who identify as white is over 90%.

It would still be worthwhile having 1% listed as 'someone else', but the system won't let me. A Hillary implosion due to a health or political scandal would likely see one or more candidates entering the race e.g. Biden. I have increased Sander's chances by 9 points given his good performance in Iowa and New Hampshire. Some commentators have talked about a similar path to victory for Sander's as Obama's surprising 2008 run. This is a good model, but Sander's lack of appeal to African American and Latino voters seems to make this unlikely. Sander's has started to appeal to those electorates and secured some good nominations, but Hillary has much more of the high-level endorsements sown up. Hillary also has the asset of a husband with high popularity in the African American community. A factor that has received little coverage, but is crucial, is the important of super delegates. Few realise that while Sander's victory in NH was decisive he only won half the delegates and Hillary won the other half (with two to declare). This is because around 30% of delegate votes go to a number of elected officials and party officials in each state. Hillary won all of them in NH and will likely do very well nationally. Super Tuesday is the real crunch test for Sanders. Winning in two small states, with one right next store to your Senate sate, is one thing. Winning across a variety of states on one day is a completely different story. If Sanders fails to do well on Super Tuesday his campaign will essentially be over. If Hillary does worse than expectations she has the resources, experience, political support and will to take the fight to a long-drawn out slog.

Quick test will be the Nevada D caucuses on the 20th.  These are closed, as were Iowa's, and Clinton should win them, although maybe not much bigger than she won Iowa.  In the short term, Sanders is a threat, especially because the 24-hour so-called news networks have to keep the kettle a-boil.  Over time, he will almost certainly fade.  There are still many Ds who remember Barry Goldwater (who by the way was probably too moderate to get the R nod this year, as incidentally was their demigod Reagan the Senile). http://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2016-presidential-primary-schedule-calendar/"], [15365, "2016-02-10T21:39:45Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [12240, "2016-02-10T21:07:22Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45], ""], [19759, "2016-02-10T21:02:12Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [19170, "2016-02-10T20:54:01Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [11885, "2016-02-10T20:51:58Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [19757, "2016-02-10T20:42:57Z", [0.82, 0.0, 0.18], ""], [14617, "2016-02-10T20:27:18Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [19745, "2016-02-10T19:51:51Z", [0.85, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [19746, "2016-02-10T19:48:36Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.1], "Clinton has built the groundwork for decades.

Almost all subsystems, health, legal, education, media, political system, financial, military, residential housing, etc. - all of them are depending on subsidies from government, financed by the petrodollar scheme - means OPEC sells it's crude oil for US Dollar only, which creates an artificial demand for the US currency world wide. Here to two questions: Is this scheme going to  last forever? If not, is the US system ready for the day when this scheme ends? So far, none of the candidates even distantly discusses this fact. Who ever is elected will learn first, that the empire will collapse immediately, if the petrodollar scheme will fall and will therefore continue with the same imperial policies as before seeding controlled chaos. The electorate is left in dark by consolidated and controlled media, and therefore by definition is not informed and therefore does not consent to the tensions the US-administration is creating world wide in an attempt to maintain a hopeless position - the world will not tolerate an US hegemony. Therefore, possibly Sanders would lay the most appropriate political direction to transform the US empire to a rather team player than a hegemony, but will he be able to overcome the financial oligarchs?

If he doesn't, he'll lose S.C. later this month and 6 or 7 out of 11 states on March 1st. After that date, he'll be behind for the duration of the campaign.  Sanders does best among white progressives. Because Iowa is the fourth whitest state in the nation and third in the percentage of white liberals (see source below), he really needed to win it. Most of the other states, especially the big ones, will be considerably more difficult for him to win because of their demographics. In addition, Clinton has the superdelegates in her corner and they make up about 20% of the total delegate count. The big question now is not whether Sanders has a chance of winning (he doesn't), but whether he'll make it difficult for Clinton to wrap up the nomination by April. Sanders has the money to stay in the race to the end. He'll also pickup enough delegates in each state to make a case for continuing the campaign. At this point, I can't say whether Clinton will win 55%, 65%, or 75% of the total popular vote.

This, on paper would benefit BS in that he is selling the \u2018dream\u2019 and a change away from the establishment, pushing for income equality and some very optimistic reforms (free university fees, $15 minimum wages, and single payer healthcare). In regards to the latter, I think it would resonate well with the US population, given the huge costs currently. However \u2013 after 25 years in congress he has failed to get even 1 vote to support these ideas, and therefore feel as though it\u2019s not a realistic outcome.  Although he is running for the Democrats, he started his campaign as an individual and therefore may not have as much support from Democratic voters as HC may be able to command. Despite \u2018traditionally\u2019 being a party that supports modern social liberalism \u2013 throughout the 20th century it has become very pro-business, making it more central in its approach. This is contrary to what BS is standing for \u2013 lowering the influence of businesses through flattening organisational structures and intervening (completely opposite to how America\u2019s market based economy is run). It is for this reason, alongside an assault on corporate tax\u2019s that he has not gained funding from large institutions (as HC has been able to do), and instead had to rely on individuals and smaller donors \u2013 a source that could potentially dry up as they run out of resources. This is different to how HC has run \u2013 with huge support from influential businesses / people / groups and unfortunate as it is \u2013 this is what has historically helped other win elections.  Despite being ahead going into the IOWA and NJ polls, he got wiped out in South Carolina which has a demographic more representative of the population with many minorities. HC has shown huge support for Obama recently (tactical I would assume, as 47% of Americans approve of the job he is doing), and this may help her gain amongst these minorities of whom have the power to sway polls  With the geopolitical environment encountering new issues every single day, HC offers more experience whilst holding certain imperialist principles (she was a key member of the panel that helped certify the Bin Laden raid) and this will take many hearts at the moment of whom are worried about their national security. She has also shown to be a fantastic debater \u2013 often attacking sanders in a show of power.  The IOWA and NJ polls on the 1st and 6th Feb will determine the outcome of this election, and with the \u2018Des Moines Register\u2019 \u2013 a key IOWA newspaper recently endorsing HC over BS saying \u2018\u2019The presidency is not an entry level position \u2013 whomever is sworn into office next January must demonstrate a deep understanding of the issues facing America and also possess the diplomatic skills that enable presidents to get things done\u2019. On the other hand, BS is doing well among people who say they would be caucusing for the first time. The challenge for BS will be teaching newcomers the mechanics of the caucuses which requires a campaign to invest in training / outreach ect\u2026 and at present, BS has $27.3m has in hand \u2013 compared to HC\u2019s $33m.  The 2 options are therefore BS who is offering a \u2018dream\u2019 to regular American, and a move away from the current political climate, or HC who is pushing to build upon Obama\u2019s time in office. With the economy currently nearing full employment, with surging home sales, and increasing savings rates - I don\u2019t see there being a huge amount of reason to make drastic changes.
