Here's What That Means for You Mukherjee (2017) December 20, states that: The GOP\u2019s new tax bill, which passed Congress on Wednesday afternoon after one last vote in the House of Representatives and will be signed by President Donald Trump, is also a health care bill. The tax bill does at least as much (if not more) to upend Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, than even all of the Trump administration\u2019s thousand cuts to the health law over the past year by repealing the individual mandate. Which raises the question: Just what is the Obamacare individual mandate? And what does its repeal mean for Americans? For starters: Contrary to a statement that President Trump made Wednesday, nixing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate does not mean that Obamacare has been repealed in the GOP tax bill. The individual mandate, which requires most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage, is actually still in effect for 2018\u2014meaning that you may have to pay a steep tax fine if you don\u2019t have health insurance, for one thing. And even after the individual mandate repeal goes into effect the following year, Obamacare\u2019s individual insurance markets, federal subsidies to help Americans pay monthly insurance premiums, and Medicaid expansion in the dozens of states that implemented it will all still be in effect barring further Congressional action (para. 1-2).

Trump said he wanted to sign the tax bill before leaving Washington on Friday for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, rather than stage a more formal ceremony in January, so he could keep his promise to finish work before Christmas. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you folks to say I wasn\u2019t keeping my promise. I\u2018m keeping my promise,\u201d he told reporters in the White House. The two pieces of legislation represent Trump\u2019s most significant accomplishment with Congress since taking office in January, as well as a sign of what awaits when he returns from Florida after the Christmas holiday (para. 1-4).

All these proved wrong. What did the GJO forecasters do wrong (in my view):\n - a bit of the standard stuff of hedgehog thinking and confirmation bias - once a view is formed, people are reluctant to change it quickly and are giving more credence to information that supports their view;\n - assuming that if a few R Senators voted against the health care bill repeal in the spring, they will do so in the fall as well.

Put aside partisan critics, right or wrong, these are the reasons that it was included unopposed by the Republicans (Democrats opposed it) into the tax bill. Since we are dealing with a Republic majority Congress, in order to predict the outcome, what the Senators can justify in their heads carry more weight than what the opposition party says. \"The mandate's revocation was added to the bill because it would free up nearly $340 billion in extra federal funds during the next decade, which could be used to provide bigger tax breaks in the legislation.

Democrats are terrified of their donors, for example the real estate industry, health care, state and local governments, etc. who will be hammered by this bill, whatever it is. This bill features approximately 500 pages with cross outs and extensive revisions hand written on the margins mean that nobody right now knows what they really voted for or against. No hearing ever were held of this last minute version of the bill. This is unprecedented in modern history, perhaps forever in the U.S.  How about voters? Many of the people hurt by this bill won't see its personal impact until they file their taxes in April 2019, after the midterm elections. Only if their Federal taxes being withheld from paychecks changes will they know. However, there is a significant amount of leeway in how employees and employers agree to withhold taxes. So I'm expecting that many middle class taxpayers will get a giant surprise come tax preparation time, but too late to vote their pain in the midterm elections.

A particular item to pay attention to is whether the CBO scores the \"Cruz amendment,\" as the score for the amendment may be a death blow to the bill for moderate R's (some have said they'll vote for the bill so long as the Cruz amendment is NOT scored).  Beyond the Senate drama, timing also becomes an issue, as the House (as of now) plans to keep it's recess as scheduled (at the end of July).

Admittedly, a CR is easier, but if a budget resolution isn't passed, the GOP cannot tackle tax reform and finish health care as the budget resolution is what enables reconciliation. And given the debt ceiling issue that will come to a head in October, the longer this takes for the GOP, the less likely it will happen.

According to the Budget Reconciliation rules, they may have to abandon the first bill (incorporating healthcare repeal) in order to move on to the second Budget Reconciliation vehicle intended for tax reform. (There is probably a loophole here but it may not be politically expedient).  It appears to me that Senate Mods have the upper hand with some unlikely allies like Senator Rand Paul. Susan Collins has been steadfast as well as Rand Paul \u2013 albeit for opposite reasons. And there are many followers and grandstanders who wait to see which way it\u2019s going but really don\u2019t want to destroy Medicaid or its expansion.  Republican Senator Susan Collins has been calling for Democrats to be involved in the healthcare debate but has been ignored so far. McConnell did indicate that an insurance market fix may need to happen if repeal/replace fails. This would require Dems because it would be outside the Reconciliation process open to filibuster. The Senate moderates understand Medicaid (covering seniors and people with disabilities in nursing homes who spent everything they had before death) as well as the Medicaid expansion that now just can\u2019t be taken away\u2014a big problem in red states. The bottom line is that there is no repeal/replace bill that can pass the Senate. I'm betting that Moderate R's rule because they are clear that Obamacare repeal is a loser for the 2018 election.  They need at least 8 Dems to cover their backsides so if they abandon repeal and go with a market fix they will get those votes and be able to move past the misery of health care and attempt to be champions of tax reform."], [12879, "2017-07-15T15:15:52Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2017-07-15T12:38:32Z", [0.4], ""], [20156, "2017-07-15T07:03:36Z", [0.7], ""], [22264, "2017-07-14T23:25:26Z", [1.0], ""], [36467, "2017-07-14T19:46:54Z", [0.67], ""], [745, "2017-07-14T17:50:59Z", [0.55], ""], [34353, "2017-07-14T17:42:09Z", [0.55], "As with all the legislation questions, there's a lot of moving parts.

There's still a month left for the Senate to pass this legislation with McConnell delaying the August recess, so there's still time for them to get something passed. Assuming the GOP can't get health care passed through the Senate, they might leave it alone until after they work through tax reform, knowing that it will be significantly harder to come to consensus, but with much stronger GOP support for revamping the tax plan. That would likely be the first bill they work on during FY18 using reconciliation (of which only one reconciliation bill can be in chamber at a time). However, if the GOP decides they need to pass health care reform, as it is a key assumption of revamping the tax code, there's a decent chance the House and Senate R's will be able to find some consensus and getting some form of legislation passed. One would assume it would repeal the individual mandate, but it might not. If the GOP can get BCRA through the Senate, there's still a chance they don't pass it during FY17, as the House and Senate would have to reconcile their versions of health care and pass the same bill in both chambers. With the budget and debt ceiling issues already taking up most of the schedule in September, the GOP might focus on getting the budget resolution in place, allowing them to use reconciliation for repealing ACA again in FY18 and continuing where they left off. That situation would significantly condense the schedule for passing legislation by the timeline above, but would give the GOP all of FY18 to work health care and tax reform. Hesitantly placing it at 55% for the time being, as the GOP has made progress on health care reform. The next couple weeks will provide the indicators as to whether this happens in FY17 using reconciliation procedures. The whip count this morning indicates there are 2 No's, and 8 \"have concerns\" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/ahca-senate-whip-count/?utm_term=.cfb1a2a6ab16). If McConnell can assuage those 8, this becomes much more likely."], [1333, "2017-07-14T17:21:23Z", [0.8], ""], [12879, "2017-07-14T17:02:28Z", [0.6], ""]], "open_date": "2017-07-14T17:00:09Z", "close_date": "2017-12-22T18:00:52Z"}
