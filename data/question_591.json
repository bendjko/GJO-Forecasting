However, it is likely that a significantly bigger perecentage of the new stations uses the new and better technology, and it could even be, that old stations are being replaced by newer DC ones.

First, there\u2019s the cost of the station itself, which has decreased in some instances by more than two thirds over the last five years. Where the earliest CHAdeMO charging units could cost upwards of $35,000 when the technology first hit the market, Nissan currently offers one for less than $10,000. BMW sells its CCS charger for less than $7,000. Unfortunately, stations themselves are just fraction of the total cost burden associated with installing a DCQC. A 2014 survey by the Rocky Mountain Institute placed the real price of each new quick charge station at $50,000 \u2013 $100,000. Labor, permitting and the installation of a 480-volt transformer ($10,000 \u2013 $25,000) accounted for roughly two thirds of the final cost. Using this math, it would require an investment of as much as $600 million just to cover the state of California with enough quick chargers to match Japan\u2019s concentration\u2014 and that\u2019s ignoring the added cost of providing for multiple standards at each station. Then there\u2019s the consumer cost of the DCQC charge port on the car itself. More than half of EVs with quick charge capability offer it as an option and not a standard feature\u2014usually adding upwards of $700 to a model\u2019s sticker price.

Based on that ratio, I tried to find out how many new charging stations might be built based on the estimated growth in the ownership of electric vehicle.  I assumed that a major factor in deciding whether to build fast charging stations vs conventional charging stations is their cost. (Eg. If fast charging stations cost 9 times more than conventional charging stations, then only 1 of 10 new charging stations built would be fast charging stations.)\n________________________________________________\nThere are approximately 31 electric vehicles to 1 charging stations. Assuming that electric car sales is at 7500 a month, within 8 months there would be 60000 new electric vehicles. This means that roughly 2000 new charging stations will be built. Assumong that 20% of all new charging stations will be fast charging stations, that would mean 400 new fast charging stations. Adding the 400 new fast harging stations to the existing ones gives approximately 2400. It could be more or less depending on the actual electric car ownership growth and governmental policies and development projects.  Based on my current assumptions, it is very unlikely that there will be more than 31pp charging stations.
