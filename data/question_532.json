For prevalence data, I heavily rely on @Khalid's outstanding and highly, highly committed tracking of the last two years. There seems to be seasonality to the spread of poliomyelitis, as indicated by the CDC:  \u201c[19th century] epidemics of polio were reported from developed countries in the Northern Hemisphere each summer and fall.\u201c [1] I suspect a mother's drinking, dust, lack of rain might play a role in summer to enter a child's throat for transmissions other than oral vaccination. \"Poliovirus infection typically peaks in the summer months in temperate climates. There is no seasonal pattern in tropical climates.\" [1] The lack of seasonality in wet tropical places suggests the importance of dust in the fecal-mouth transmission outside the vaccination route. Once infected, a person remains infectious for 6 weeks; \"For the onset of paralysis in paralytic poliomyelitis, the incubation period usually is 7 to 21 days.\"[1] Hence, a one-child unsymptomatic or mild infection might yield a paralysis in other children 60 days later. The current risk is  \u2022 one in 2.5 million oral vaccine intakes, or roughly \n\u2022 one event in a million newborn-years, because a newborn will have one to three doses in the first 18 months. Moreover, the risk is  \u2022 seven in a million vaccinated adult-years (seven for orally vaccinated vs. zero for inactivated polio vaccines). Moreover, the risk is  \u2022 50,000 in a million immunodeficient adult-years.[1] By deduction, the October-vaccination campaign in the DRC with 10 million units (see @chwang http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/598271) yields another 5 cases; the question is whether the onset reports will come in before New Years Eve. A big hinderance to the \u201cbody count\u201d are the operative side of the medical infrastructure. I guess there are more lame children than actually found and reported.

(Note2: According to the polio eradication website by which this question is measured, Congo has a vaccination effort scheduled for the end of October that should reach 10 million children. I figure this could mean an additional probability of detection during that timeframe; but on the other hand,  a similar push in Pakistan that was to reach ~38 million children (if memory serves) only coincided with the reporting of a single additional case in Pakistan... this is a very, very, very rare disease.[edit2:/] @Khalid points out there is a lag between detection and reporting, so I may not have waited long enough in drawing this conclusion; that said, I'm still not aware of any additional forthcoming cases detected during the course of Pakistan's vaccination effort.[/edit]) Congo would only require one more instance of detection to reach 10 cases. Using the timeframe of this question as a base rate, there is currently a (4weeks_in_which_an_instance_of_detection_in_congo_occurred /13-weeks_elapsed) = ~31% probability of Congo reporting at least one case in a given week (if I counted right). I don't really know what I'm doing, but (if I'm thinking about it the right way) the plan is to use that weekly probability to adjust the \"1\" bucket each week that Congo goes without reporting a case by readjusting the number of weeks elapsed in the calculation above and the number of weeks on which to perform a trial remaining using the BINOMDIST function in excel, which returns the probability of x or fewer successes in\nn independent Bernoulli trials: BINOMDIST(x, n,p, cumulative=TRUE), where x=0, n is the number of remaining weeks in the question, p = 4/(total number of weeks elapsed in the question) (I think cumulative is irrelevant because x=0). The math when applied to such assumptions says Congo should report a case soon (obviating all this elaborate calculation), but if it doesn't, subsequent weeks for the 1-bucket would look something like this: 10/17/17\t: 2%\n10/24/17\t: 3%\n10/31/17\t: 6%\n11/7/17\t: 10%\n11/14/17\t: 15%\n11/21/17\t: 22%\n11/28/17\t: 31%\n12/5/17\t: 41%\n12/12/17\t: 53%\n12/19/17\t: 67%\n12/26/17\t: 83% edit1: something should i guess be added back for the possibilities that one of either afghanistan or pakistan but not congo reaches 10 cases, but i haven't done that calculation; could be fun but probably negligible given the above assumptions... i'll just fudge for now. [edits 3&4:/] might be better to assume 4-9 instances of detection and daily (rather than weekly) Bernouli trials (i.e., 4-to-9-detections/(7days/week*13weeks), the range in the numerator following from the fact that each instance of detection could have multiple cases or just one). in the event time passes without detection, i'd probably weight recent (non-)events more, which could result in dropping one or more earlier instances of detection from the model, resulting in higher probabilities for the \"1\" bucket.

There has been a reduction in WPV in Pakistan (3 cases so far this year compared to 13 last year), Nigeria (none compared to 4) and Afghanistan (5 compared to 6), but the increase in cVDPV is disturbing, as it has been caused by the Type 2 component of the oral vaccine, even though Type 2 has not occurred in the wild since 1999. However, since April 2016  oral tri-valent vaccine has been replaced by the bivalent type (Types 1 and 3 only), so we may see less of cVDPV Type 2 from now on. In 2016 only Pakistan and Afghanistan reported more than 10 cases, whereas this year Syria already has more. There is some concern about more cases being found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to civil war like conditions in parts of the country, and my personal choice of a wild card is Yemen where  children are unlikely to have been immunized over the last year or two (and where a major cholera epidemic is currently raging). Pro-rata compared to 2016, Afghanistan is on track to have 11 cases in 2017, Pakistan 5.

I think @Danbell sums it all up very well and I'm going with his prediction for now. I also looked at the Global Peace Index as war and terrorism contributes to this problem. Was looking at countries that worsened in the 2017 index and Syria remains the worst/least peaceful country in the world with Afghanistan second.\nSyria and Afghanistan added cases this week as of 7/19:\nSummary of newly-reported viruses this week:  Afghanistan \u2013 one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case and one new WPV1-positive environmental sample; Syria \u2013 four new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolated from AFP cases."], [31450, "2017-07-20T17:13:09Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Compared to a lot of questions I answer here, this was actually a nice one to look into because of how good the progress has been in the last few years. So far this year 10 of more cases have only been reported in Syria. Lookinng at the trend lines, there were two countries in 2016, three countries in 2015 & 2014, and 6 countries in 2013. Point in this disease is steadily retreating and the fact that no new cases have been reported since mid June. Pakistan's numbers are way down from previous years and I don't see polio exploding (relatively speaking) there in the next few months. That said, one new case per month in either Afghanistan or the DR Congo seems reasonable.

Afghanistan is on pace to match last year's total of 13 cases given YTD data, and as an endemic country is always a candidate to exceed 10 cases. Pakistan is reporting significantly less cases based on YTD data compared to last year at this point, but is an endemic country, so the potential exists for a large outbreak to push it over the 10 case bar. However, current focus on eradicating polio in the country decreases the likelihood of a large outbreak not previously reported. Focusing primarily on 2 countries at this point. DRC could come into contention, given that it also has an Ebola outbreak to contend with straining medical resources, and the Lake Chad countries could come into play with a spread from DRC and conflict in CAR. But there are no strong indicators of a potential large outbreak at the moment."]], "open_date": "2017-07-18T17:00:13Z", "close_date": "2018-01-01T07:59:13Z"}
