So far all it has done is lowered the minimum amount of asset purchases per month. Technically speaking the FED has not committed to reducing its purchases.  I bring this up because when the FED makes a statement about something that it is going to do this is an action as much as the actual action itself is. Right now it seems the market is reassured by the idea that the FED can always step in and buy up assets whenever the market needs them to, and having the FED reduce its minimum amount of purchases does not stop the fact that the FED could always purchase more if necessary. However, if the Fed stated that they are ending the program altogether that would be a completely different type of signal. If the market knew that the Fed was not there to buy treasuries on the back end I think it would do quite a bit to reduce purchases on the front end. All of this \"tapering\" is also data dependent. Do we really think there are going to be no economic hiccups in the next 6 months? With central banks around the world all winding down their asset purchases, who is going to purchase US debt? They just signed a trillion dollar plus infrastructure plan and they are about to pass a $1.7 trillion BBB plan. Who is going to buy all of this debt if not the fed, especially if investors suddenly think they have to actually hold the treasuries and the FED is not there to buy it off them on the back end. All these treasuries have negative real returns. What honest to God investor would want that?

So far the little bit of tapering they have done has not had much impact, but I think it's important to keep in mind that the national government has been dealing with the debt ceiling and has been issuing less debt than normal. Once the debt ceiling issue is resolved and once the infrastructure plan gets passed there's going to be trillions of dollars worth of treasuries issued which the Federal Reserve will likely need to purchase.  So far Powell has made it clear that any additional tapering will be totally dependent on the data. And I'm confident if the Fed has to choose between inflation and the stock market it will always choose to stimulate the stock market. I expect that before they ever taper off quantitative easing completely they will reverse course and increase the purchases. And certainly we will never get so far as actually raising the federal funds rate. If they were actually serious about combating the inflation they'd be raising the federal funds rate to 6 or 8% right now but that would be instant depression. CPI is at 6.2% annual right now, and is set to rise because producer price increases are over 8% and companies have been hesitant to pass those costs on to consumers but it will happen eventually. What real investor in their right mind would pay 1.55% for a 10-year treasury when inflation is over 6%?
