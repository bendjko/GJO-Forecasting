Some of that may be due to intrinsic properties of the variant, some may be due to more people being vaccinated. I think the prevalence of Omicron balanced with its probable reduced lethality to me seems like a good guess at the next 4 months would be to assume the same number of deaths as the last four months. So I'm roughly centering around 816 + 166 = 982,000 deaths. But keeping the distribution wide because we still don't know a lot about Omicron and waves can vary substantially. I'm also skewing toward the lower side a bit because 166k deaths over 4 months would imply ~1400 deaths a day, and it's possible we could see Omicron peak quickly and supply immunity to the population that protects somewhat in the last two months or so of the question period.
