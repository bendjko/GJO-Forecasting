All sports betting markets also favor UNC, with UNC currently at roughly -145 vs +135 for Villanova.  While these numbers are very close, examining the history of the two teams tells a different story. UNC is one of the most respected teams in the country, with 6 overall NCAA wins and 19 appearances in the final 4. Villanova, meanwhile, has only ever won one NCAA title. Looking at the history of the teams against on another, UNC has won 5 of the 6 games where the two teams played one another. Based on the history of both teams, I revise slightly upwards from 54% to 60%.
