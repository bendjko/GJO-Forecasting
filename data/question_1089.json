Syrian forces may initially act as a deterrence to Turkey but not seize full control of the areas, Strack said. That could change in coming weeks, however.

Assault on Syria\u2019s last opposition stronghold 09/06/2019\nGraphic News September 6, 2019 -- The Syrian army, backed by Russian airpower, is steadily gaining ground in northwestern Idlib province, the last bastion of opposition forces battling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. All summer long Syrian and Russian jets have bombed Idlib, destroying homes, hospitals, schools and bakeries, according to The Economist newspaper. The United Nations sought to protect medical facilities by sharing their co-ordinates with Russia, but after dozens of air strikes on hospitals and clinics, doctors came to believe that the no-strike list was in fact being used as a target set. They have stopped sharing their locations. On the ground the Syrian army has retaken Khan Shaykhun, the site of a regime chemical-weapons attack in 2017. The biggest town in the south of Idlib province, it occupies a strategic position along the M5 motorway that connects Damascus to Aleppo. \nhttps://www.graphicnews.com/en/pages/39486/SYRIA-Rebels-losing-ground-in-Idlib-province"], [79142, "2019-09-05T16:57:06Z", [0.15], ""], [77594, "2019-09-05T15:38:47Z", [0.05], ""], [35877, "2019-09-05T12:56:38Z", [0.0], ""], [78664, "2019-09-04T15:21:55Z", [0.02], "Syria is a pawn in the Russia-US and Iran-US international relations.

While his autocratic rule was once threatened, he is now making attempts to re-establish himself as a world leader on the international stage. Formerly opposed to Assad, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and other regional actors have already accepted the undeniable reality on the battlefield that Assad is victorious and there is no chance of a rebel victory.  After the outbreak of the Civil war in 2011 and the support to the rebels by almost all the West (with also a military support in the case of the USA), Syrian president Assad seemed doomed to disappear from the political scene, and probably also from the world itself. However, Russia's intervention has upset the course of events, progressively re-establishing Assad into power. On the other hand, the US, regardless still condemning Assad, after the election of Trump lost interest in the Syrian conflicts (albeit showing the muscles in the aftermaths of some human rights violations like the 2017 gas attack). Furthermore, with the support of Iran and Russia, Assad has also now achieved to defeat ISIS. The majority of the internal population is exhausted after 8 years of conflict and now wants stability, no matter if this means having still Assad in charge.  That said, reconstruction funding for Syria is estimated at $400 billion. Therefore, it is also likely that Syria will need substantial assistance from the United States and/or the European Union.  In exchange for financial help, the West might ask for \u201cAssad\u2019s head\u201d or at least for new democratic elections. However, Assad enjoys the full support of Putin hence he is unlikely to accept such a compromise, at least not before the end of his 7-year term. Therefore, the U.S. and E.U will have to accept the hard truth that Assad won. Unless for natural death or an unlikely assassination (it would have happened before), he will be still in power in 2020.

Youssef and Nissenbaum (2019) Jan. 11, stated that: WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. military has begun moving equipment out of Syria as it pushes forward on President Trump\u2019s order to withdraw forces, but planners are still working out details of how and when more than 2,000 troops will leave, defense officials said Friday (Para.1). Some logistical and support troops have now moved into Syria, after first going to Kuwait and Iraq, to help with an eventual U.S. withdrawal, defense officials said. At the same time, a small number of U.S. troops operating in Syria left in the past week, and a limited quantity of nonessential equipment has been moved out, usually on helicopters that delivered other cargo to Syria. The U.S. military also is putting Navy ships, aircraft and personnel into place to support troops as they withdraw, particularly at the vulnerable point when forces are leaving the country. Despite those movements, the U.S. military has said the pullout is in its initial stages and that officials are largely working to position forces and equipment in the region ahead of the withdrawal. The exit plan is slated to take roughly four months, the officials said. Complicating the planning is the timing of the withdrawal. While U.S. forces usually leave at the end of a conflict, in this instance, they likely will be battling Islamic State even as they are moving out, officials noted. Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Friday that the military has taken \u201ca number of logistical measures\u201d to support the withdrawal but hasn\u2019t begun to formally redeploy troops. \u201cThe withdrawal is based on operational conditions on the ground, including conversation with our allies and partners, and is not subject to an arbitrary timeline,\u201d he said (Para. 1-6).

None of the major players with a stake in the conflict are actively calling for his removal (Turkey, in particular, has reigned in its rhetoric and western powers are fairly impotent now). There is a historic precedent for infighting within the Syrian regime leading to the removal of leaders. However, Hafez Al Assad removed most potential mechanisms for this kind of leadership change. Moreover, although the civil war is winding down, Assad's supporters are unlikely to abandon him when there are still significant challenges to his consolidation of control over the country: think of the Kurdish-led SDF in the north-east of the country, the presence of the Turkish army in Afrin, and the continuing presence of terrorist groups in areas ostensibly under govt control (think of the IS-claimed Suweida attacks in July 2018 for example) Taking the outside view, I haven't dived into this in detail, but the political leaders of the victorious sides in civil wars rarely step down that soon after victory. I have found no examples of this from the past 20 years. Perhaps there are cases of leaders stepping down after a negotiated end to hostilities, but 'negotiated' is the key word there. Assad has won through strength (amply abetted by Iranian troops and Russian jets of course), and while local ceasefires may slow the government advance, they are very unlikely to stop it. Assad is still fairly young (53 years) and a challenger for the presidency could only emerge from within the regime, unlikely within the next 1-2 years given his role as a figurehead for regime supporters throughout the civil war.
