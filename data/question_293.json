Shortly after the coup, Prayuth said that elections would likely be held \"by the end of 2015\". By late 2014, however, several government officials had said publicly that elections would not be held until 2016, around mid-year. In May 2015, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said that elections would now be held \u201caround August or in September\u201d 2016, after the government announced its intention to hold a referendum on its draft constitution, which would likely be held sometime in early 2016. In June, Prayuth said that he was willing to stay in office for another two years if people \"wanted him to\", following a push by the National Reform Council (NRC), a government body, to hold a vote on whether or not the government's reforms should be completed before elections were held. This would mean general elections might potentially not be held until early 2018, but a few days later distanced himself from the NRC's initiative after facing backlash for his remarks. This, however, left the door open to the \"completion of the reforms\" under another government that would also see elections further postponed, if the NRC's initiative succeeded.\n__________________________\nCOMMENTS: Perhaps not in 2017, or before 2018"], [691, "2016-10-06T12:42:31Z", [0.78], ""], [29443, "2016-10-06T11:00:07Z", [0.39], ""], [21884, "2016-10-06T04:56:44Z", [0.05], ""], [25021, "2016-10-05T23:37:29Z", [0.33], "Saying the right thing is easier than doing the right thing, so not reading too much into Prayut Chan-o-cha's \"commitment\" to November '17 election.

They did also recently hold a referendum to approve a new constitution enshrining a decent chunk of military power, so it's understandable that they feel able to hold elections, secure in the knowledge that nothing too terrible can happen (from their perspective). The complicating factor here is the health of the King, who is 88 and ailing. He may not last the year, and if he does it seems quite probable that he passes away some time during 2017. How that would affect any scheduled elections, I don't really know. Obviously the interests of the Thai military & monarchy are quite closely interlinked. The Crown Prince lacks his father's popularity and to a degree I think we can expect the military to sort of hold his hand throughout the first few years of his reign.
