Western media portrays it in pessimistic terms: \u201cThere\u2019s a 90% chance he\u2019ll be a disaster, but I\u2019m going to vote for him anyway,\u201d told a 36-year-old nurse to The Guardian, on why she is going to vote for comedian Volodymyr Zelensky . \u201cI know 100% that the current guy is a disaster, so of course I\u2019ll go for the 10% chance we could really change things.\u201d I believe that her viewpoint is representative for the population of Ukraine, which is why I am going to forecast a 90% chance that Zelensky will be the next president of Ukraine.  His election campaign has been founded on being unlike the other politicians and defying convention. He has eschewed official rallies and conventional speeches, choosing instead to use social media to address the electorate (hence the nickname \u201cthe Trump of Ukraine\u201d). He is up against incumbent president Petro Poroshenko, who has a more established network on the ground and the support of administrators across the country. Zelensky is the protest vote.  He has made his lack of experience a virtue and publicly admits to having no strong political views: \"No promises, no disappointment\" is one of his electoral catchphrases. He didn't have to explain who he was, since everyone knew him from the show he has been starring in (Servant of the People), which explains his popularity, especially among students. He led a positive campaign, focused on optimism. His lack of experience is a competitive advantage because he doesn't have the baggage that comes with being in power - corruption, disappointments.  However, his popularity is justified not only by his optimism, but also by the innovative manner in which he has been handling his opponent. He seems to always be a step ahead of Poroshenko through actions such as forcing him to give blood to be tested for drugs live on television or suggesting the Olympic stadium as a place for debate - so that he can be \u2018closer to the people\u2019. Another example is their separate scheduled meetings with French president Macron. While Poroshenko had announced his meeting in advance, he was the second to meet Macron. \nHowever, his rivals have called his campaign \"shady\" in the sense that he is not articulating any concrete policy recommendations. This is the reason why I will not forecast a 100% probability that he wins the election. \n57% of Zelensky\u2019s voters will be rather voting for him, and not for Poroshenko. However, only 22% of Poroshenko\u2019s voters would vote for their candidate in protest of Zelensky; 75% of Poroshenko\u2019s voters will be voting for Poroshenko himself, which shows that Zelenesky is the protest choice. Petro Poroshenko Incumbent president and one of the wealthiest persons in Ukraine, has focused on aggressive war rhetoric and anti-corruption. He positioned himself as the only candidate capable of standing up to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who in 2014 annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and backed the separatists who seized control of parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the East. \"You'd be a weak head of state who would be unable to defend yourself from Putin's blows,\" he told Zelensky on Friday, the last day of campaigning during an election debate held at Kiev's Olympic Stadium. While his policies may address the current needs of the Ukrainian society more than Zelensky\u2019s campaign, his reputation has been damaged since corruption is still a large issue in Ukraine.  Polls This being said, we will now turn to look at the polls. As of today, there is little doubt that Volodymyr Zelenskyi will win the second round of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election. The comic earned a little over 30% of votes in the first round on 31 March, compared to under 16% by his competitor. The latest opinion poll by the Kyiv International Sociology Institute (KIIS) predicts that 48.4% will vote for Zelenskyi and 17% for Poroshenko in the second round. \nPoll\t                 Poroshenko    Zelensky\tAgainst all or Will not vote\nKMIC\t\t   \t 17%\t48.4%    28.3%\t    6.3%\nEdison Research\t30.9%\t55.1%\t11.6%\t2.3%\nRating\t\t        20.8%    51.0%    17.8%    10.3% Other polls show that most Ukrainians expect their lives to improve after the election. According to a poll by the Rating group held over 12-16 April, 48% of respondents expect things to get better in Ukraine after the elections; 25% don\u2019t have any expectations, and 10% expect things to get worse. Individuals in the South and East, young people, and Zelensky\u2019s voters tend to be more optimistic than others. Earlier this month, Oleksiy Antypovych, Head of the \u201cRating\u201d sociological group, said that according to their poll conducted over 5-10 April, 41% of Zelensky\u2019s voters will be, essentially, voting against Petro Poroshenko. This number has grown over the last two months \u2013 from 33% in February 2019. This shows that Ukraine, a country which has suffered from corruption and war is now looking for a way to more forward with optimism and humour.

It declared that the forecast will remain the same due to the lack of decisive events, but with enough time left for these to happen. As the election will take place today it is time to assess several aspects: A) Did Zelensky manage to sustain his lead in the polls or did Poroshenko overtake him? B) Did anything happen which would benefit one candidate more than the other based on their campaign profile? C) Who benefits from the recent presidential debate? A)\tZelensky remains the frontrunner with a large lead in the polls -> + Zelensky   It is worth to mention that it is difficult to find reliable (recent) poll/survey sources about the Ukrainian presidential election as a researcher without language proficiency in Ukrainian or Russian. Therefore, this forecast trusts in the credibility and quality of popular Western media outlets such as The Guardian or BBC to find reliable and recent (= week 16 if possible) polling results (alternatively, their summary). As a result, Zelensky seems to remain the frontrunner in this presidential election. Furthermore, it appears that he was able to maintain or even expand his advance to his opponent Poroshenko: \u2022\tThe Guardian -> Zelensky 72%  | Poroshenko 25% \n\u2022\tPolitico -> Zelensky 52% | Poroshenko 19% \n\u2022\tIndependent -> Zelensky 70% | Poroshenko n.a. \n\u2022\tBBC -> \u201cZelensky is the clear favourite [\u2026] polls say\u201d & \u201cpolls suggest he is on track to get more than twice as many votes on Sunday\u201d B) Poroshenko likely couldn\u2019t shift attention to his main campaign points (war related) as no significant events happened in the east of Ukraine -> + Zelensky   Previous forecasts assessed that both candidates have created individual campaign profiles which have been focusing at different policy areas. Poroshenko has been promoting his image as national defender in the war against separatists and Russia, while Zelensky has been representing himself as an anti-corruption candidate similar to his popular TV-character. Foreign Policy, among others, agrees on these assessments and calls Poroshenko the \u201chead of the party of foreign achievements\u201d and Zelensky as the \u201cleader of the party of domestic issues\u201d. The relevance of these campaign profiles lies within the candidates\u2019 potential to portray themselves in a positive way. For instance, new clashes in the east could increase the fear of Ukrainians of an annexation by separatists, thus, likely increasing Poroshenko\u2019s chances to win the election. On the other hand, revealed scandals involving business partners of Poroshenko would benefit Zelensky\u2019s claim that he is the only option to fight corruption within Ukraine.  Poroshenko\u2019s campaign is based on the war in the east, independence of the Ukrainian church from the Russian patriarchy and a promotion of Ukrainian culture by substituting Russian with Ukrainian in public domains. There hasn\u2019t taken place any significant battle in the east which could represent a new escalation wave. Furthermore, it seems that most Ukrainians are war fatigued and would rather end the war than cause a new upheaval. As a result, Poroshenko couldn\u2019t win any voter sympathy in this aspect. He was able to gain an upwind in previous polls by promoting the independence of the Ukrainian church, however, Foreign Policy argues that this policy area, as well as the promotion of the Ukrainian language, aren\u2019t as important policy fields as other major areas (such as economics, corruption, labour, etc.) to the ordinary Ukrainian voter. This would mean, that Poroshenko shouldn\u2019t expect a raise in voter approval for Sunday, while Zelensky who mainly focuses exactly on these aspects will likely benefit from the undivided attention to his main campaign areas. A previous forecast determined that Zelensky\u2019s possible ties to the oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky might become a problem to his credibility as a \u2018true\u2019 anti-corruption candidate. Indeed, Western media outlets seem to have shifted more attention to this possible link than they had done before. This Western media coverage might not be representative for Ukrainian media outlets, however, it seems that Zelensky managed to maintain his image as there were no \u2018scandal\u2019 articles about him confirming links to oligarchs such as Ihor Kolomoisky.  C) Poroshenko failed to expose Zelensky as an (as he claims) incompetent outsider -> + Zelensky  The last debate turned out to be more a TV spectacle rather than a presidential debate which benefits Zelensky as he wasn\u2019t forced to explain specifics about his future plans. Therefore, Poroshenko\u2019s accusations of Zelensky being incompetent and unfit to become president ended up as empty claims rather than an opportunity for the incumbent president to benefit from his gained experience. BBC, among other media outlets, assesses that the debate has been a \u201cdraw\u201d for both candidates. Nonetheless, it was Poroshenko\u2019s turn to shift the momentum in his favour which he failed to do. This means that Zelensky benefited from this debate in the end as he managed to avoid pitfalls and mastered his first political face-off.   Conclusion:  None of the above-mentioned points indicate a turn in Poroshenko\u2019s favour. It is a general rule to expect that the voter turnout of young voters, who comprise a large part of Zelensky\u2019s support base, will be less than the overall average, however it is very unlikely that the participation will drop so much that Poroshenko could benefit from it. Zelensky managed to gain 30,4% (in comparison to Poroshenko\u2019s 17,4%) in the first round despite the usual drop within the young voter base. Taking every mentioned aspect (from this forecast and from previous ones) into account, this forecast assesses a 100% likelihood for Zelensky to become the new president of Ukraine.  (Annotation: the likelihood of Poroshenko winning is assessed to be lower than 1% which means it is practically non-existent in GJO terms).

The rest ist made up of around 18% who are as of now undecided, 9% who did not disclose their decision, 6% non-voters, and under 2% who said they will spoil the ballot. Among those who have made up their mind, Zelenskiy reaches 72% compared to Poroshenko's 25% (http://euromaidanpress.com/2019/04/18/sociology-of-ukrainian-elections-who-votes-for-zelenskyi-and-poroshenko-and-why/). While Zelenskiy has sometimes been referred to as the \"Donald Trump of Ukraine\" (https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-presidential-election-1.5103213), the parallels stop at the fact that they are both political outsiders. In fact, Zelenskiy's voter base tends to be younger and more urban than Poroshenko's who scores highest among people over the age of 60. While people with a finished college degree tend to vote for Poroshenko (31% as opposed to Zelenskiy's 22%), the former comedian counts more students among his supporters (42% of students voted for him in the first round, 17% voted for Poroshenko). Interestingly enough, what seems to attract young people the most, is Zelenkiy's reputation for \"undecidedness\", contrasting Poroshenko's public image of a slow  and cautious reformer. Lastly, there is a sentiment among many Ukrainians that things will get better after the election. In a recent poll, 48% expect a better future, 25% don't expect any change and only 10% expect a turn for the worse (http://euromaidanpress.com/2019/04/18/sociology-of-ukrainian-elections-who-votes-for-zelenskyi-and-poroshenko-and-why/). These numbers along with the low level of confidence in the government (just 9%) might explain Zelenskiy's imminent success better than anything else (https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-47980484). Given that Zelenskiy remained rather elusive throughout his campaign, leading some to speak of an \"Anti-campaign\" with few political speeches  and almost twice as less money spent than his political opponent, yesterday's presidential debate was highly anticipated (https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/582190.html, https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-47980484). Most national and international observers did not declare a clear winner but agreed that Zelenskiy largely managed to hold his own against the more experienced Poroshenko (https://www.rferl.org/a/six-takeaways-from-the-poroshenko-zelenskiy-showdown/29892421.html, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47990267, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/19/ukraines-presidential-rivals-trade-insults-in-raucous-stadium-debate, https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-presidential-candidates-trade-insults-in-final-debate/4883549.html, https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/thousands-rally-in-kiev-in-support-of-incumbent-president/2019/04/19/0267b4b6-62a1-11e9-bf24-db4b9fb62aa2_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ecc9deff463a).   Thus, despite his inexperience and vagueness concerning future reforms (or rather due to it), everything points toward Zelenskiy winning tomorrow's election by a large margin."], [67423, "2019-04-20T19:31:55Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0], "Update: After the nation wide TV debate, Zelenskiy has managed to keep up his lead in the polls."], [67423, "2019-04-20T19:24:53Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Apr 20, 2019 07:31PM UTC"], [62808, "2019-04-20T18:40:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [67420, "2019-04-20T18:37:14Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [66728, "2019-04-20T17:32:55Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [67426, "2019-04-20T16:27:00Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.85, 0.0], "The reasons are several: Firstly, looking at the results of the first round of presidential elections on 31-03-2019 Zelenskiy got about 30% of the total amount of votes (which is a whole lot keeping in mind that 39 persons could be voted for). His direct opponent Poroshenko had gotten a mere 16% of the votes, and hence only exactly half as much than Zelenskiy did, leaving the latter as the clear winner of the first round elections (https://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2019/wp300pt001f01=719.html). Therefore, I believe that he is more likely to be elected president in the second round of votes on April 21st. \nSecondly, a poll from the beginning of this week gave Zelenskiy an estimated 72% of the votes as opposed to 25% for now reigning president Poroshenko (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/18/ukraine-elections-actor-and-comedian-volodymyr-zelenskiy-poised-to-win-crushing-victory), hence also the polls see Zelenskiy to be winning. \nThirdly, many may vote for Zelenskiy on an 'anyone-but Poroshenko basis', meaning that it does not necessarily matter out of which reasons they vote for Zelenskiy, as long as Poroshenko will not be re-elected. They dislike his personality, politics, and the fact that he did not deliver what he promised when taking up the position after his election. Additionally, 91% of the Ukrainians believe that their government is corrupt (http://time.com/5573719/the-quick-read-about-ukraines-run-off-presidential-elections/), hence re-election for the current President is not the way to go -  many just want to see Poroshenko gone. \nLastly, Zelenskiy is seen as charismatic, likeable, and funny who persuades with his mere personality. Moreover many like it that he is a TV-star as opposed to a politician, because they believe he brings new winds, directions and ideas into Ukrainian politics and see this as a step to actually make a difference in the country. Additionally, the content of his politics is pro-Western, pro-EU and pro-NATO which hence is mirroring the opinions of many of the Ukrainian population.  Lastly, critics who claim that he has no experience within politics (loudest of all Poroshenko) and therefore should not be elected can be silenced by an easy example: Donald Trump! He neither had ever had any experience in politics, yet got elected as President for the worlds largest democracy. Consequently this shows, these things can happen if and having a former TV-star and comedian as President does not seem as unlikely anymore.

The results make it obvious that Ukrainian people are ready for a change. Zelenskiy\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d electoral campaign, which included playing a president in a TV show \u201cServant of the people\u201d and using different sources of social media, appeared to be more efficient than the one of Poroshenko, even though Poroshenko spent much more money on his campaign. However, it\u2019s also believed that Poroshenko might still have a chance, since he\u2019s experienced politician, who can play his cards right before the second round.  It needs to be mentioned that in 2018 nearly 50% of Ukrainians claimed that they wouldn\u2019t vote for Poroshenko under any circumstances, which meant that Poroshenko got the highest \u201canti-ranking compared to the other candidates. According to the same survey, on the question \u201cwhat are the most important problems for the country now?\u201d the three main answers were: first, the conflict in the Eastern Ukraine; second, bribery and corruption in the governmental institutions; and third, unemployment   ( https://www.kiis.com.ua/materials/pr/20181113_Monitoring/RG_3UA_Monitoring_112018_press.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2-E9otDoIrmfzOV0YN08bQpDl3yADZ5h2kG0H3difllmIgmoSs20z-zl4 ). Most likely Ukrainian people are giving a chance to a new person, since Poroshenko\u2019s presidency went along with lots of mistakes and it is highly unlikely that Ukrainian people's feelings towards Poroshenko will dramatically change in 2-3 weeks. Hence, Zelenskiy is the one that holds 95% chance of becoming the next president of Ukraine. Furthermore, I believe that the voters of Tymoshenko (13,40%) and Boyko (11,67%) will vote for Zelenskiy rather than Poroshenko, giving Zelenskiy even higher probability of winning.

In order to win, Poroshenko would have to receive 34% more total votes from people, who already voted for a change in president. Therefore, they are more likely to vote for Zelenskiy, because he does represent change. Furthermore, Poroshenko already vastly outspent his political rivals at 415 UAH, which is over 4 times what Zelenskiy spent (102.8 UAH). By this logic Poroshenko spent 4 times as much money to get half as many votes, once again indicating Ukraine is seeking a change in its leadership. Finally Zelenskiy is a well known and popular Ukrainian entertainer whom people already associate as a President due to his role in the popular 2015 Ukrainian TV show \"Servant of the People\". Therefore, people tend to have a positive association of Zelenskiy whereas they have a negative perception of Poroshenko because of everything that went wrong under his presidency (Crimea, Donbass, etc...).

In my previous forecast, I said that Zelenskiy was going to pass for sure - which happened with around 30% of the polls - and that Tymoshenko and Poroshenko had the same odds to pass the first turn - Poroshenko passed with 16%, Tymoshenko is out of the run with her 13,4 (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47767440).

Now that the first round is gone and that there will be a ballot between Poroshenko and Zelenskiy, I deem right to increase the likelihood to a 95% chance.  Firstly,  Zelenskiy won the first round with  5,713,825 votes against the 3,014,538 of current president Poroshenko. Therefore, we are talking about a significant difference in terms of votes (30% against 15%). Furthermore, as charts show, Zelenskiy success is transversal, involving both the center and the periphery.  Secondly, trends show that since Ukraine introduced the ballot, the candidate who had won the first round then became President winning also the ballot. This time is even more likely since polls show a gap of 10 points between Z and P (55% vs 44%).  Finally, Tymoshenko's voters are unlikely to turn into Poroshenko voters. They are long coming political \"enemies\". Furthermore, as I said in the previous forecast,  while Poroshenko and Tymoshenko together represent the old and established politics, Zelenskiy represents an element of novelty and freshness. He is the so-called \u201canti-establishment\u201d, a figure that currently is attracting many voters worldwide. This might be even truer since the climate of dissatisfaction and distrust of institutions registered in Ukraine. Ukraine's people want something new, something who does not smell of old politics. In this sense, Zelenskiy seems to be at the right place at the right moment.  I'll live a 5% chance of  Poroshenko winning just in case of a last minute huge scandal/revelation involving Zelenskiy's figure and legitimacy, albeit very unlikely.

Admittedly, Poroshenko has the advantage of having held public office (and seeking reelection), but with six of nine candidates identifying with a party that is at very least mildly right and only three (including Poroshenko) identifying as an independent, I am extremely skeptical that Poroshenko could rally enough support to cross the 50% threshold."], [36801, "2019-04-04T19:49:08Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0], "With Yulia Tymoshenko now out of the race, the real question now is who will her votes go to; Poroshenko or Zelenskiy?

Since Tymoshenko and Poroshenko\u2019s views matched more closely than hers and Zelenskiy, it is likely a majority of her supporters will back Poroshenko, but some supporters may choose to not vote at all since their candidate is out of the race. There is also the question as to who will gain the majority of voters who supported the other candidates, and Zelenskiy holding almost twice the supporters of Poroshenko will undoubtedly influence which candidate they choose. Zelenskiy has challenged Poroshenko to a televised debate, which should help his standing among those still on the fence unless he performs horribly.

Poroshenko is more expirienced and more of a hard liner against Russia, that Zeleskiy. So more tension and bigger combats will rally support for Poroshenko. But Kremlin is not interested in Poroshenko gaining another 5 years, so they will probably hold low profile and hope for the win of Zeleskiy, whom the big boys can probably pressure afterwards. So it leaves the same rate of 57 % against 43 % in favor of Zelenskiy.  But other factors could also gain more support for Zelenskiy. Yuri Boiko, a controversial former energy minister, who served under Mr Yanukovych and who represents the interests of clans from the south-east of the country, is a more or less pro-Russian candidate and he gained 11,6 %. His voters will be more prone to vote for Zelenskiy. \nIt is reasonble to think that it will gain Zelenkiy only 9 % , as some of the voters will probably think he is too unexpierenced.

Further, the eruption of more corruption scandals during the latest weeks of Poroshenko's campaign is expected to impact the standing president's position moving into the second round of elections when the country must decide between the two.  What may be damaging to Zelenskiy though, and push voters toward Poroshenko, is that he is Russian speaking. In the context of an ongoing dispute between Ukraine and Russia, growing Ukrainian patriotism and rising tensions surrounding language rights, voters -- particularly in the West -- may be inclined to support Poroshenko. Voters in the East are, however, expected to welcome his bilingualness.  Zelenskiy has also, quite controversially, said he would be open to talking with Putin about resolving the conflict. For this reason, Poroshenko's position has been strengthened to 35% in this forecast. Overall though, Zelenskiy remains very popular among young voters and those feeling defeated by the current political system.

The underlying rational is that such battles would very likely benefit Poroshenko in the second election round due to his experience in governing a war-torn country and shifting the attention of Ukrainians to 'his' main campaign topics. Indeed, he benefited from incidents in the past (see Strait of Kerch incident for instance). To the contrary, Zelensky might lose voter support as he lacks the political experience (or war related expertise) and his main campaign points focus more on anti-corruption/establishment rather than on the war with Russia.  @Greyowlsova argues that it is unlikely that major battles will occur due to the fact that Putin prefers Zelensky as president and, hence, would suppress Ukrainian separatist to launch a full-scale invasion or other severe battles. The user assesses a 0% likelihood of Poroshenko winning the election due to Zelensky\u2019s potential to gain support from the voter bases of former presidential candidates (I share this opinion) and the \u201cnon-existent\u201d threat of major lethal confrontations which would benefit Poroshenko in the polls.  I disagree with the 0% probability for Poroshenko as I disagree with the \u201cnon-existent\u201d likelihood of severe conflicts occurring within the next weeks. Smaller skirmishes might spiral out of control and destabilize whole frontline sections, especially if one belligerent has an interest in the escalation (namely Poroshenko).  However, acknowledging the arguments of @Greyowlsova, I adjust the probability of Poroshenko winning the election down to 10% based on the reduced estimated probability of severe battles while still considering the possibility of them. Other reasons include the uncertainty of who the voter bases of former candidates will choose as new frontrunner and other uncertain events with high impacts on the election.

In the end, Mr. Zelensky was able to gather 30,4% of all voters behind him which means that the actual result was higher than the aggregated poll recorded (8,0 more than the last poll with 22,4% at the 28.03.19). Also Mr. Poroshenko managed to proceed into the next round with 17,8% of all votes (3,7 more than the last poll with 14,1% at the 28.03.19). The predicted close race between Poroshenko and Tymoshenko took place as well (Tymochenko: 14,2%). Further, Boyko's constituency remained roughly the same size.  The new distribution of probabilities is based on 2 aspects: \n1) Zelensky managed to gain 1,7 times more votes than Poroshenko \n2) He also got roughly a 2,2 times bigger 'after-poll-surplus' (additional 7,6%) than Poroshenko (additional 3,7%) The new assessment is based on first assumptions who the voters of the other candidates will likely support. Tymoshenko's voters will likely support Zelensky due to a common anti-corruption stance. Also, Boyko's voter should support Zelensky regarding that Zelensky's current voter base comprises of Russian speakers and that Boyko represent the candidate of the remaining Russian minority. Poroshenko will likely benefit from Hrytsenko's former voters due to a common focus on the war in the east and a focus on joining the NATO. As a result, Zelensky should be able to succeed becoming the new president as he will gain enough voters from Tymoshenko\u2019s and Boyko\u2019s constituencies. However, there is a possibility for Poroshenko to become President if he manages to gain enough new voters from the other candidates.

The following forecast will be structured in three sections: a short introduction of Ukraine\u2019s presidential election process, a brief summary of the complex political contexts within the country, issues concerning polls and finally the presentation of each (relevant) candidate and the assessed probabilities of their chances to become Ukraine\u2019s next president.  The election process comprises up to 2 rounds if none of the candidates is able to gain a majority vote (above 50%) in the first round. In this case, the two candidates with the most votes for them will proceed into a second round. This means, unsurprisingly, that most of the remaining 39 candidates don\u2019t have a realistic chance to become president which could result in assessing a 1% likelihood for the option \u201cNone of the above\u201d, including uncertainty that maybe a surprise candidate wins the election. However, a 1% likelihood might be challenged if indicators/research results benefit candidates who aren\u2019t perceived as front runners but still have stable constituencies backing them such as Yuriy Boyko (ex-energy minister and pro-Russian candidate), Anatoly Hrytsenko (a.k.a. Grytsenko; ex-defence minister) or Oleg Liashko (a.k.a Lyashko; radical party leader).  Ukraine faces a civil war in the east of the country against separatist movements in Donezk and Lugansk. These para-military groups are most likely supported by the Russian Federation which also annexed the Crimean Peninsula according to the Ukrainian government and several other states. The increased anti-Russian mentality in the Ukrainian population in combination with the missing votes from these districts (a.k.a. oblasts) results in an insufficient constituency which is unable to support its pro-Russian candidates to become president (such as Boyko).   Another important political context is the corruption within the country and the resulting influence of oligarchs and clans on Ukrainian politics. Several candidates themselves are oligarchs (Poroshenko himself is an oligarch for instance) or are backed up by them (like Tymoshenko; there are also accusations against Zelensky to be a \u201cstealth candidate\u201d of an oligarch). The Maidan Revolution shouldn\u2019t only be interpreted as a pro-European upheaval against the old pro-Russian government but should also be understood as a protest of ordinary Ukrainians against corruption and its beneficiaries. As a result, candidates which are accused of being oligarchic puppets, as well as candidates which are labelled as old establishment, have a decreased likelihood to succeed in the presidential election in general.  An additional issue resulting from the influence by oligarchs is the lack of objectivity in polls by Ukrainian institutions or media. It is assumed that polls are misused to influence voters rather than inform them. For this purpose, relying only on a few statistics may lead to wrong impressions who will win the forecast. To tackle this issue, the forecast at hand will mainly rely on aggregated data from several polls made by TEXTY.ORG.UA. The credibility of this aggregated statistic is based on the sponsorship by the Ukrainian Think Tank Liaison Office in Brussels which itself is supported by several EU or EU-member states institutions and think tanks such as the European Parliament or the German state-owned development agency GIZ.  The option \u201cNone of the above\u201d is so far assessed to be at 1% regarding the overall diminishing support the majority of candidates receive. Yuriy Boyko\u2019s approval rates oscillate between roughly 7% and 8% since January 2018 which makes him the fourth frontrunner in this election. However, this represents the support of the remaining pro-Russian minority in the Ukrainian country who are able (=/= eligible) to vote despite the conflict. For this purpose, it is unlikely that he will increase his constituency base any further, hence, his position doesn\u2019t have an increasing effect for the group of \u201cNone of the above\u201d. Hrytsenko\u2019s approval ratings oscillate between 7% and 9%. He is labelled as old establishment due to his former position as defence minister dating back before the Maidan Revolution which makes a sudden increase in his approval ratings unlikely, despite his early pro-Western stance of Ukraine joining the NATO and so on. Liashko is the leader of the \u2018Oleh Liashko\u2019s Radical Party\u2019 (several names exist). His approval ratings reached a peak in March 2018 with around 7%. Since then they declined and consolidated at roughly 4,5%, thus, being the candidate with the least support among the ones discussed in this forecast. The underlying party of Oleg Liashko managed to increase their parliamentary seats from 1 in 2012 to 22 in 2014 while also being part of the governing coalition. Regarding a survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in mid-February the party would manage to enter the parliament by gaining 5,7%, hence, exceeding the threshold of 5%. Nonetheless, the radical nature of the party and its relative low approval ratings makes it a minor party in comparison to other parties which isn\u2019t likely to be able to push their candidate to become the next president. Neither Hrytsenko nor Liashko seem to have a realistic chance to become presidents or enter into the second round, hence, the probability for \u201cNone of the above\u201d remains at 1%.  Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s main advantage is his missing political history. He uses his popular TV show to further promote his image as a newcomer without oligarchic support who focuses on fighting corruption. Through hiring experienced reformers, he also underlies his intention to promote structural change. Both aspects are highly appealing to Ukrainian voters as they reflect the goals of the Maidan Revolution. Accusation of Zelensky being a \u201cstealth candidate\u201d of an oligarch might be motivated to harm his image campaign. Nonetheless, he would lose his credibility if such ties should be confirmed. Another issue which decreases Zelensky\u2019s chance to become president is the downside of being a newcomer to politics. A missing historical (and political) record may convince risk averse voters that the uncertainty in supporting him is too high. Additionally, his voter base comprises mainly of young voters who tend to participate less in elections than other age cohorts which would be a benefit for Poroshenko and Tymoshenko. However, his approval ratings improved significantly. While Zelensky received an average support of 7% during early and mid-2018, the ratings skyrocketed from December 2018 onwards. He managed to increase his approval ratings from 10,2% at the 1st of December 2018 to 22,4% at the 28 of March 2019. He leads the polls since the 19.01.2019 and managed to end up with an 8,3%-difference to the second frontrunner at the 28.03.2019. To sum up, his popularity combined with a political message which mirrors the ideals of the Maidan Revolution seem to pay off in form of a growing voter base. Therefore, this forecast assess that Zelensky will become president with a 70% likelihood.  However, it seems to be unlikely that Zelensky will gain more than 50% in the first round due to the fixed voters bases of other candidates (see above and below). As a result, there will be a second round with another candidate which might be able to catch up to Zelensky during that period. The question is if this will be Poroshenko or Tymoshenko. Petro Poroshenko is the current president of Ukraine and as such benefits from the advantage of incumbency. This gives him a special position to gain popularity by political actions, but also bares the disadvantage as being responsible for negative events and developments in the country. His approval ratings were declining from 10,5% to the lowest result of 6,9% in July 2018. There are various reasons for this decline. One is the ongoing war in the east and a steadily increasing war fatigue among the civilian population who direct their anger towards Poroshenko due to his position as Chief of the Ukrainian army. The prolonged war also deepens the economic misery of the country which affects most Ukrainians. As a result, Poroshenko faces increased antipathy from his fellow citizen who see him as part of the oligarchy, a political group who is assumed to be interested in maintaining these conditions. Especially the lack of reforms to tackle corruption within the country is seen as evidence that Poroshenko is indeed part of this old political establishment. However, since July 2018 Poroshenko managed to increase his approval ratings from 6,9% up to 14,1% through policies which promote Ukraine\u2019s independence and sovereignty such as supporting the independence of the Ukrainian orthodox church from the Russian patriarchy or the unrelenting stance towards Russia related to eastern Ukraine, Crimea\u2019s status and the conflict in the street of Kerch. Events and development which enable Poroshenko to present himself as defender of Ukraine seem to improve his ratings. Yulia Tymoshenko tries to present herself as solution to the problems which causes antipathy towards Poroshenko. She displays herself as a candidate who is willing to fight corruption and who is able to improve the economy. While voters may trust in her ability to improve the economy, due to her positions as head of an energy company and being a former prime minister of Ukraine, they might not acknowledge her anti-corruption stance. Voters still identify Tymoshenko as old establishment with ties to oligarchs due to her history in Ukraine\u2019s politics. Her aggregated approval ratings oscillated cyclically between 12,5% and 15,4% from January 2018 to March 2019. Her support is declining which resulted in a 12,5% rating in March 2019. It seems that she might not be able to turn back in time as Poroshenko achieved better results than her since mid-February. So far Poroshenko seems to remain the second frontrunner. This forecast is backed by the results of the presidential election in 2014 when Poroshenko got elected with 56% in the first round while Tymoshenko only achieved to gather 13% of the voters behind her. However, the close results in the approval ratings and Tymoshenko leading over a long period don\u2019t indicate a same decisive victory of Poroshenko as last time. Poroshenko will be assessed with 15% probability and Tymoshenko with 14% probability to become president of Ukraine in order to reflect this close race between the both candidates Sources: \n-\tUkrainian Think Tank Liaison Office in Brussels 2019: About us: https://ukraine-office.eu/en/about-us-2/\n-\tElectionGuide Democracy (2019): Ukraine.

Hence, instead of a classical base rate as point of departure, the forecast at hand takes a look into the electoral system of the Ukraine, as well as current polls. The President is elected by absolute majority vote through a two-round system (in case no one of the candidates will win 50% of the votes in the first place) (http://www.electionguide.org/countries/id/223/). Out of the 42 candidate, the three candidates listed in the forecast question are leading the polls (to such an extent that the forecast at hand can already rule out the answer #4) Zelenskiy enjoys a big majority within the polls. According to the NGO Rating Group, 26,6% of the Ukrainians would vote for him, as of March, 27, both Poroshenko and Tymoshenko would receive 17.2% of the votes (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-election-poll/comedian-zelenskiy-dashes-ahead-in-ukrainian-presidential-race-idUSKCN1QL16X) Based upon these polls, the forecast at hand considers it as most likely that Zelenskiy will make it into the second round. Furthermore, he has two major advantages over the other two candidates: He is a newcomer. His decided vague anti-establishment program allows him to unify a broad range of voters across party lines and the Europe-Russia divide. His popularity got furthermore promoted by his TV-show, where he played a teacher that became a successful president saving the country, as well as by his social media campaigns (https://ukraineverstehen.de/trubetskoy-ein-fest-der-ukrainischen-demokratie/).  The cases for the other two candidates are much harder to calculate. In the early presidential elections in May 2014, Tymoshenko clearly failed and received only 12.8% of the votes. In the parliamentary elections in October 2014, her party suffered heavy losses as well and, at 5.68%, only just passed the 5% threshold. Similar to Zelenskiy campaign, Tymoshenko\u2019s one points out the failures of the current government, focusing on corruption and a stronger economy. However, her populist past, as well as the perception of her being part of the unpopular old political establishment just like Poroschenko might become very difficult for her to overcome (https://ukraineverstehen.de/nelles-tymoschenkos-dritter-versuch/). Yet, her anti-popularity polls are still lower than the ones of Poroshenco. He has almost completely lost his former electorate and has to struggle with a high degree of public mistrust. 69% of the Ukrainians say they do not trust Poroschenko - compared to 30% saying the same thing about Tymoshenko, and among those who intend to vote in the presidential elections, almost every second respondent (49.6%) said he/she will not vote for him under any circumstances. However, his patriotic campaigning, portraying him as only one capable of defending the Ukraine against Russia, seems to work to a limited extend, as his polls has been slightly going up lately (https://ukraineverstehen.de/trubetskoy-ein-fest-der-ukrainischen-demokratie/).  In sum though, non of these observations enables the forecast at hand to make a reliable distinction between both candidates\u2019 chances of success. Thus, both candidates will be attested a 25% chance to win the elections, while - based upon the former arguments, in combination with the two-step electoral system, a 50% chance is estimated for Zelenskiy to win the elections."], [15409, "2019-03-30T16:49:05Z", [0.2, 0.1, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-03-30T13:33:19Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0], "Looks like another good year for clowns in presidential elections.

This would have enabled us to showcase any tendency among voters in Ukraine but also, look at the percentage of accuracy of the opinion polls  in the very last weeks before a given election in Ukraine (on that note, it would have also been important to keep in mind that opinion polls are not predictive). Nevertheless, I could not find enough resources to use this idea, most of the information being in Ukrainian.  Petro Poroshenko:\nPoroshenko is third in the opinion polls (http://ratinggroup.ua/en/). Like Tymoshenko, he is the face of the establishment and is highly criticized for the slowness of his reforms, especially with regard to corruption. Considering the general mistrust and disappointment concerning him, and taking into account that the citizens of Ukraine have never re-elected a President for a second mandate since Koutchma, it is very unlikely that the people will re-elect him, given the economic and political context. In that sense, I expect him not to run for the second round.  Yulia Tymoshenko: \nFrom her position in the opinion polls (2nd) plus considering the above argument, I expect her to be opposing Zelenskiy during the second round of the Presidential elections, in April 2019. She may be another face of the establishment, not having the trust of the people but she still has a good chance of winning the Presidential elections if she gains Poroshenko\u2019s voters or if some of Zelenskiy\u2019s voters decide to change their mind and give their vote to someone with better political experience.  Volodimir Zelenskiy:  \nHe is at the head of the polls. The citizens of Ukraine do not trust and are tired of the old political class. Zelenskiy is the new face of Ukrainian politics: he points out the problems and solutions that most Ukrainians want to hear. Thereby, he seems to have restored the hope of a good part of the population which seems better inclined to elect someone to whom they identify, rather than a person who is mistrusted. On the premise that Donald Trump was elected \u2014 taking into account his inexperience in politics and background in entertainment \u2014 there is a good chance that Ukraine follows the American lead."], [59836, "2019-03-24T18:06:25Z", [0.4, 0.1, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [63658, "2019-03-24T16:20:59Z", [0.08, 0.01, 0.91, 0.0], ""], [67428, "2019-03-24T15:50:22Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.75, 0.0], "Because of the structure of the Ukrainian electoral system, there will be a first turn on the 31st March, with 44 candidates participating. If none will reach the 50%, there will be a second turn with a run-off on the 21st April. According to the current polls, there are only 3 candidates who have the chance to win the first turn. Poroshenko\nPresident in office since the 2014, he has obtained the popular support most of all during and right after the Euromaiden protest (manifestations pro Europe), which he sustained. He was the alternative to the then-President Yanukovych, a pro-Russia politician which at the last minute had decided to don\u2019t sign an agreement with Europe. In the last months, after the Azov Sea crisis, Poroshenko has regained some consensus, rebuilding its image as defender of Ukraine against Russia, and imposing the martial law. However, he is member of the old political class and has not satisfied the people expectations: even if he has managed the main tensions between Russia, he has not been able to eradicate the corruption (key condition to receive economic support from IMF and EU), social and political scourge in Ukraine. He is basing his campaign on topics too weak as religion and languages, trying to keep them far from the \u201crussification\u201d, when the country necessities reforms to face its economic difficulties. Also, he has not yet resolved the thorny issue of Crimea and Russia. Tymoshenko\nShe has guided the Orange Revolution (against corruption and Russia inference in 2004), and she has been in prison during Yanukovych governance (the charges and prison sentence were later ruled by Europe's human rights court to have been politically motivated). \nShe is also part of the establishment (in politics since the \u201890s, twice Prime Minister) and she is the most unpopular among the 3 candidates. Also, she has been criticised for being lying in her promises and also for tackling the European policies and reformations implemented after the Euromaiden, gaining the disapproval of the youngers. \nHowever, she can gain some consensus proclaiming herself against the current government and its failure, empathising with the common feelings. Zelensky\nHe represents it the eyes of the population, the opposite of the previous two. He is not part of the \u201cestablishment\u201d because he is not (yet) a politician, but a comedian. He joints the population in criticising the current politicians, describes them as outdated and incapable after having failed in respected their promises. Moreover, he has not a real clear programme, but he is behaving in order to catch a consensus from a lot of sides. He depicts himself as a defender of the Russian language in Ukraine, gaining the votes of the southeasters people. He has announced his intention of opening negotiations with Russia in order to resolve the Crimea issue, plus he pull on its fight against corruption. These two elements of course help him to gain the votes of a huge part of the population. Even if he is not so clearly a supporter of the EU, he talks about salary policies and help to the weakest layers of the society.\nHe will also absorb the votes designed to the minor pro-Russia candidates, too weak to be elected at the first turn.\nAlso, he uses social media to establish a empathic relationship with the people and, last but not least, there are some rumours that he is supported financially by the TV tycoon Kolomoisky. Even if this wouldn\u2019t be true (Kolomoisky denies it), Zelensky would have anyway a social support from him.  I think that the re-election of Poroshenko or Timoshenko are really unlikely because they are both symbol of an old political elite. Looking to the current sentiment pervading Europe, and also to history of politics, it could be common that in a democracy, a politician would be not re-elected after a while because he had not satisfied the expectations of the community. So, the population tents to change and want to try something new.\nIn addiction to these statements, there is the general global trend pro-populism, spread everywhere in the world. My hypothesis is corroborated by the experience to which we have assisted recently in other countries, where the community rejects the old political class and prefers to elect an \u201coutsider\u201d, with the hope to change the system. In 2009, in Italy was founded the 5 stars movement, which tried to catch the discontent of different groups, from both left and right wing (plus, fun fact, its foreman is a comedian).\nFor these reasons, I think that he will win the first turn but without reaching the 50% (according to the polls he is now at 26%). At the second turn I think he will win again even if there is still possibility that, in order to contrast Russophile politics, the voters could join each other to elect Poroshenko or Timoshenko, but I see it as very unlikely.

According to a recent survey conducted by the Kiev-based Razumkov Center, the 41-year-old Zelenskiy, a comedian and now political novice, is ahead of current President Petro Poroshenko and his biggest opponent Yulia Tymoshenko. Indeed, according to the last polls, Zelenskiy would get about 25% of the votes (considering the total number of people willing to vote not the entire population in which case would be 13%) while the other two opponents are in a head to head both around 17-18%. Therefore, considering that the elections are in less than a week, it is extremely probable the outcome which sees Zelenskiy taken most of the votes.  However, since Ukraine has a presidential system and its constitution require a quorum of 50% in order to be elected as president it is almost impossible that any of them, Zelenskiy included, will be able to reach that result at the first turn. As a consequence, the new president is likely to be chosen in the second round of the elections scheduled for the 21st of April where the 2 most voted opponents will run alone against each other. Despite there are more than 40 candidates, the real competition is among the 3 given candidates. Hence, I assess the option \u201cnone of the above\u201d with a 0% chance.  Regarding the three principal candidates, as said it is almost sure that Zelenskiy will win the first round and thus run in the runoff to be held 21 April 2019. Regarding the other two, since they are very close in the polls and I have little knowledge of the internal political debate,  it is difficult for me to say who will run against Zelenskiy. That said, after some research I found that current president Poroshenko, having positioned himself as the only non-Kremlin-friendly candidate, his team should direct all efforts to get their candidate into the second round of the presidential elections. In this sense, he will probably receive also the endorsement of the European institutions and the Western world in general and this might be a good asset for him. However, also if he arrived at the second turn, according to another poll ( http://ratinggroup.ua/en/research/ukraine/monitoring_elektoralnyh_nastroeniy_ukraincev_yanvar_2019.html) 80 percent of Ukrainians are dissatisfied with the performance of President Poroshenko (15 percent are satisfied). Therefore, the possibility that people who voted for other candidates in the first round will vote in masse for him in the ballot is unlikely. For this reason, in a head to head between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko I deem the former as the most likely winner.  Regarding the scenario where running against Zelenskiy in the ballot, there will be Tymoshenko, I see Zelenkiy as the most likely winner anyway. Firstly, because from November 2018 to January 2019, Tymoshenko\u2019s ratings stagnated. According to Mykhailo Minakov, she and her team had focused too much on preparatory work, and lost momentum in the public debate over issues connected to the Orthodox Church autocephaly and the imposition of martial law in response to Russian aggression in the Sea of Azov. Secondly, while Poroshenko and she together represent the old and established politics, Zelenskiy represents an element of novelty and freshness. He is the so-called \u201canti-establishment\u201d, a figure that currently is attracting many voters worldwide. This might be even more true since the climate of dissatisfaction and distrust of institutions registered in Ukraine. Finally, since the strong opposition conducted in the last years, Poroshenko supporters are unlikely to vote for Tymoshenko, but this would actually depend on who Poroshenko decide to endore in case of defeat.  Concluding, for the above-mentioned reasons, I assess Zelenskiy as the most likely next Ukraine's president and I assess this outcome with a 65%. Regarding Poroshenko and Tymoshenko, I assess a 20% chance for the former and a 25% chance for the latter.

It is very likely that the tendency in the polls will remain the same until the election day. However, when it comes to actual elections, I consider it very unlikely that he (or any other candidate) could win during the first round (it means, getting more than 50% of votes). To support this argument, I think, it is enough to say that even though Zelenskiy is leading the polls, only every fifth citizen of Ukraine supports him. Hence, in my analysis I mainly focus on second round, which means which candidate would be more likely to take over voters whose candidate won\u2019t make it to the next round. I think, this is a critical point of my forecast.   Tymoshenko \u2013 5%. I consider to be very unlikely that Tymoshenko would win Ukraine elections at the end. If Tymoshenko enters the run-off, I have no doubt, her opponent will be Zelenskiy. In this case, it is important to look closer at two factors \u2013 Poroshenko\u2019s  voters and what is the difference between Zelenskiy and Tymoshenko voters. \nTo start with, the first question is if Poroshenko\u2019s voters would support Tymoshenko in the second round. A lot of voters chose Tymoshenko just because it was the only one alternative for those who are against Poroshenko (before Zelenskiy showed up). Poroshenko\u2019s campaign is built on anti-corruption while Tymoshenko still faces her past criminal charges of bribery and embezzlement. I think, it decreases the chance that she would be able to convince the majority of Poroshenko\u2019s voters to vote for her. My prognosis would be that, in this scenario, some of people would decide not to vote while others would more likely to choose Zelenskiy who is quite good at avoiding any serious political discussions so far. Zelenskiy \u2013 40%. My biggest uncertainty here is the first round of the elections. Tymoshenko and Poroshenko share very similar support of Ukraine people. Hence, even though, there is a quite strong consensus that Zelenskiy will enter the run-off, it is still quite unclear who will be his opponent. I consider that if Poroshenko succeeds to enter the run-off, his chances to win is bigger than Zelenskiy\u2019s. Starting with Zelenskiy\u2019s voters, it is obvious that Zelenskiy is the star of the social media. He tries to appeal a lot to those young people who do not actively participate in elections. However, the history shows that the social media segment is not very reliable when it comes to the actual voting. As well as the electorate of young people who usually are tend to support more actively in the social network than in the actual elections. To add, even if somehow majority of them come to the vote, the chances of them coming to vote twice, are very likely to decrease. Another factor is Zelenskiy\u2019s ties with oligarch Kolomoyskiy. Even though, Zelenskiy might look like Ukraine\u2019s Trump and the leader of anti-establishment, people of Ukraine still remember their president Yanukovych and the \u2018heritage\u2019 he left. Hence, the reason I give quite a big chance of 40% for the Zelenskiy is mainly related to Poroshenko\u2019s chances to enter the run-off. Poroshenko \u2013 55%. The president representing stability, a clear stand against Russia and continuity of the reforms that have been going on in Ukraine. Even though, polls are not very supportive towards him, I think, in the long run, he has the biggest chances to win the Ukraine election. First, his voters are more stable than Zelenskiy\u2019s. As it is presented above, young people and social media are tend to be not very reliable source of support. In addition, it is visible that Poroshenko\u2019s rating is getting better. It can be explained by that people start actually noticing the benefits of his reforms. For instance, he stands for specifying in the Constitution of Ukraine the country's aspiration to join the EU and NATO. Hence, I think very important factor is that besides many drawbacks, he occupies the place of a pro-western candidate. As a result, pro-western voters are more likely to choose him no matter dislikes of some of his policies. As mentioned, my biggest concern here is the first round of the elections.

Poroshenko is pushing hard for a quick break with Russia. Nevertheless, in a survey of October 2018, it is shown that 48% of Ukrainians had a positive opinion of Russia and 32% a negative opinion (Source: https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=rus&cat = reports & id = 795 & page = 1).\nThe Ukrainians, although wanting a Ukraine closer to the west with the entry into the European Union and in NATO, do not want to cut themselves definitively of the big Russian brother. Poroshenko plays on the division, while Zelensky, from a region and a Russophile family, can gather Ukrainians wanting to emancipate from Russia while wanting to keep links with the country. Volodymyr Zelenskiy wants to be the spokesman for Russian speakers in Ukraine, and he is in favor of a dialogue with Russia.\nIt is also necessary to take into account the Ukrainian electoral system, where a first poll will take place on March 31, 2019, and a second on April 21 if no candidate receives an absolute majority. In view of the polls, it is therefore very likely that a duel will take place on April 21, between Zelensky and Poroshenko or Tymoshenko.\nOnce this second round in place, it is very likely that Zelensky wins against any of its competitors.

President Poroshenko was elected on promises of implementing structural reforms and increasing collaborations with Western Europe.  He has delivered somewhat on the economic front. However, critics argue that the reform-work has stagnated, and the anti-corruption measures have not been successful. Consequently, the Western support that Poroshenko has experienced could falter further.   The increasing public disillusion with Poroshenko\u2019s precedency has given spurred on the out-sider Zelenskiy\u2019s campaign.

Despite these intentions, Zelenskiy\u2019s program remains rather undefined and he has no prior experience with holding public office.

Ukraine's economic and political situation is volatile at the moment and though it would appear perfect for a candidate such as Zelenskiy, he has absolutely no experience and will be completely unable to operate within the nebulous political elite.

I believe that Zelenskiy and Tymoshenko are competing for the same voters, and are running a more similar platform than Poroshenko, who is advocating for continuity rather than change. Because Zelenskiy is a complete outsider to politics (not unlike trump in this respect), a good speaker, humorous guy, I believe he is able to obtain most of the voters that are calling for change. His campaigning on social media and his upcoming tv show will give him a boost in visibility that his opponents do not have.  Therefore I am assuming that Zelenskiy is reaching the runoff, likely together with Poroshenko, because his constituents are not poached by other candidates. Moreover, Poroshenko beat Tymoshenko before, and it is unclear to me why he would lose now.  Therefore assuming that Poroshenko and Zelenskiy make the runoff: \nVoters for Tymoshenko and smaller (some of which pro-Russian parties) will decide who wins between the two. Zelenskiy, due to being less vocal about Russia, being a fresh outsider, and advocating for change is likely to win this runoff.  However, in the event that Zelenskiy and Tymoshenko reach the runoff, the voters who will decide the elections will largely be Pro-Russian voters and poroshenko voters. Poroshenko voters I believe will rather go to Tymoshenko because of the fact that the outsider element through which Zelenskiy obtains most of his voters is not working on these voters. Tymoshenko is vocal on Russia, however has also been accused of cooperating with them in the past, which could sway pro-russian voters. In this scenario I still believe Zelenskiy can win, but the vote will be closer than in the case of a Poroshenko/Zelenskiy Runoff.

Petro Poroshenko & Yulia Tymoshenko:\nBoth are members of the political elite, and are regarded by much of the public with mistrust. Their political careers both place them as part of the \u2018establishment\u2019, and in the context of Russian invasion of Ukrainian Crimea and civil distress, neither are trusted to bring Ukraine forward. While Poroscenko has placed himself as anti-Moscow, pro-European candidates, this is unlikely to resonate with the public. For Poroshenko, failures to deliver on promises during his presidency has seen his support decline, and his low approval rating by his own parliamentary fraction means he is running as a self-nominated candidate. A poll on the 28th of January revealed that 80% of Ukrainians thought their country was headed in the wrong direction (IntelliNews, 29 January 2019). The likelihood of Poroshenko being re-elected is thus considered relatively low (15%). Former prime minister, Tymoshenko, has launched a an initiative to impeach Poroschenko \u2014 which may damage his campaign. While Tymoshenko has been a frontrunner in the polls for some time, more recent ones places her behind both Poroschenko and Zelenskiy (Emerging Europe 27 Feb 2019, [1]). Her unpopularity is linked to the aforementioned factors, as well as her opposition to pro-EU reforms. With Ukraine\u2019s general pro-Western attitude, her position makes her unpopular particular among young voters. She has also \u2018\u2019occupied the top spot in an analysis of \"populists and liars in Ukrainian politics\" conducted by the Kyiv-based think tank Vox Ukraine in February 2018\u2019\u2019 and it unlikely she will overcome Ukrainian disillusionment with the system. It is therefore considered unlikely she will win the election, but more likely than Poroshenko at 25%\u2014 who is currently the face of that system.  Volodymyr Zelensky:\nZelensky entered the presidential race as an anti-establishment, anti-government candidate \u2014 a comedian and TV personality \u2014 and has evidently resonated with the public. Recent opinion polls place Zelensky well ahead of Tymoshenko and Poroshenko (Unian 20 Feb 2019; [1]). He is particularly popular among voters, aged 30 and below. Zelensky\u2019s main challenge will be in mobilising his supporters, since young people turn-out of Election Day has traditionally been low \u2014 which is accounted for in the 55% forecast. However, in that he has been running \u2018\u2019a rather technological and non-standard campaign. He is actively using Internet and new media and effectively exploits the protest attitudes and grievances of Ukrainians,\u2019\u2019 it is believed that this mobilisation is underway. It is thus considered quite possible that Ukraine will join the ranks of nations electing unorthodox candidates (CNBS 12 Feb 2019).

If he's going to pass the first turn, a good campaign by Zelenskiy can have a huge impact in underlying the previous administrations' limits, which in my opinion can lead to his victory, If, on the other side, Tymoshenko is going to pass the first turn, the battle in the second turn will be between a new figure in the political scene (Zelenskiy) and a long-standing presence in the Ukranian political dynamics (Tymoshenko is present on the scene since at least the early 2000s). In my opinion, in both these scenarios Zelenskiy is more likely to win. Nonetheless, Tymoshenko has more odds rather that Poroshenko to win the elections.

Zelenskiy's 3-15 point lead in recent polling would suggest an electoral advantage moving into the final weeks of this campaign, especially in the context of a regional and international trend towards electing anti-establishment candidates, but this data should be taken with a handful of salt.  Firstly, Ukrainian polling data is reportedly unreliable and susceptible to its sponsors' biases. That, in addition to the errors we've seen with polling data in other recent elections internationally, should call into question the utility of polling data for forecasting this election.   Moreover, it's unclear that even the most accurate opinion polls could get this call right; that is, the result of this election may be determined outside the ballot box. Foreign agents are both highly incentivized and historically inclined to \"meddle\" with this election. Thus the result here may be more a product of Putin's agents' success than any candidate's. Whether this is sufficient to overcome Poroshenko's incumbent machinery (or the potential for undemocratic actions on his part) is unclear.
