From What I have seen the two candidates who have a chance at beating President Emmanuel Macron are National Rally candidate Marine La Pen or Republicans candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse (BBC News, 2022). While La Pen has a good chance at making it to the run-offs, to face against President Macron, I do not believe that she stands a chance at beating him. La Pen is currently facing backlash due to her past ties with Russian President Valdimir Putin and for her anti-NATO sentiments (Dodman, 2022). The Ukraine Crisis has been favorable to President Macron\u2019s polling numbers (Rose, 2022). La Pen also stands to lose some of her supporters to right wing candidate Eric Zemmour (BBC News, 2022). I do not believe that Eric Zemmour has a chance to face off against President Macron, but I do believe that he can take away from La Pen\u2019s voter base. When Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse first launched her campaign, she quickly rose in polls, since she was views as a pro-European moderate candidate and could appeal to some of President\u2019s Macron\u2019s voters (BBC News, 2022). But as time went on, her numbers have fallen and her campaign has stalled (Signy-L'abbaye, 2022). If she finds a way to reenergize her campaign, she stands a chance face off against President Macron.

The next best candidate based on my research is Valerie Pecresse, which is a part of the Les R\u00e9publicains party. She is only slightly behind Macron in the first round of voting intentions. Studies have also shown that Eric Zemmour, who is a part of the Reconqu\u00eate party has increased some of his favorability.

That said, one thing that jumped out at me in the provided background links was just how unpredictable French politics and elections can be.  It seems that prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the biggest challenges to Macron\u2019s re-election bid were shaping up to be from potential far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour.  Both have historically been complimentary and friendly toward Russia and Putin, while also pushing a France first agenda over strong ties to the EU and NATO.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent strengthening of European and NATO alliances is likely to hurt Le Pen and Zemmour given their previous positions, however it remains to be seen how French voters feel about the strengthening of the EU and NATO alliances and where they see France fitting into that.  How Macron is able to navigate this situation is likely to have a major affect on the ultimate outcome the election.  If he is able to ensure France has a central role in European decisions moving forward I think it will help him, however his failure in gaining much traction in brokering a diplomatic solution prior to the invasion could hurt him a bit as well.  If it appears France is pushed into a backseat, this could sour French voters who may lean toward a more France first agenda.  Either way, a concerning trend is that turnout for the most recent regional elections was down significantly with 66% of registered voters abstaining in the June 2021 elections.  My initial feeling based on my research prior to the formal registration of candidates is that the La Republique en Marche candidate will win the next presidential election in France.  Update: With Macron formally announcing his candidacy and his approval ratings on the rise due largely to his handling of the war in Ukraine thus far, I still believe he is the most likely winner.  Nearly all polling shows him with a comfortable lead as does the election modeling from The Economist referenced below.  The current focus on external affairs is likely to help Macron as other candidates would prefer to focus the discussion on internal issues.  One additional thing to note, with so much volatility in Europe right now, I feel this improves the chances of an unlikely or unexpected event potentially having a significant effect on the election.  Additionally, candidates in the mix with highly polarizing views could lead to surprises as sometimes support might not be fully reflected in polls or models where historical data is used.

The next competing candidate trails by a wide margin at 18% (Le Pen). In 2017, Macron beat Le Pen in Round Two polling by a 66% to 34% margin. In order to determine if Le Pen would fare any better in 2022, I evaluated the results of the 2021 regional elections. Le Pen suffered a sharp decline in these elections, with polled voting intentions for her candidacy dropping from 26% to 17%.  Very recent events cannot be discounted for influencing Macron\u2019s chances of re-election. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has united NATO and EU countries together in a unified response, arguably not witnessed since the fall of the USSR. President Macron\u2019s popularity has increased, per polling conducted in France on 25 February, for his handling of the Ukraine crisis. His proactive and assertive attempts at diplomacy with Vladimir Putin in efforts to prevent the invasion, and public support with Ukraine and NATO/EU allies after the invasion, resulted in a five percent increase overnight in public polls by the BVA group. Therefore, Macron\u2019s already strong position in the polls combined with his handling of the Ukraine crisis will secure him re-election in 2022.

The frontrunner I believe to be the LaREM party as they are incumbent and most of all organizationally healthy compared to many of the opposition parties that are very fluid in representatives and political organizational capabilities to facilitate large scale political success. The LaREM party has shown that their candidate has the ability to make the final round of voting and will have the financing capable of supporting such a political run. Current polling shows a lead of the LaREM party by varying degrees based on the poll taker. My secondary choice for a victory with about a 20% chance would be the National Rally party as they have a have chosen Marine Le Pen to be their candidate. The current leader of the party she is also the the daughter of the party founder and has with a strong conservative approach to her political opinion may provide an alternative choice to the more moderate LaREM party. This along with an updated overhaul of the values in which the party supports can provide voters with optimism the party is headed in the correct direction and in line with voter opinion. \u201cThe leader of the National Rally wants to end immigration, slash crime, eradicate Islamism and save France from globalization, but has rowed back on plans to pull it out of the EU. Her \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d would favour French business, while \u201cFrance-first\u201d social policies in housing, health, education and employment would favour French people. There are signs that her drive to sanitise the party founded by her father, Jean-Marie, in 1972 has cost her some of its traditional support.\u201d The remaining parties seem to have limited ability to mobilize beyond the 20-30% voting rates required to proceed far within the presidential elections. This will result in most likely a showdown between LaREM and a philosophically different party or a battle of conservative values of LaREM against National Rally.   Guardian News and Media.

I think Macron (LREM) and P\u00e9cresse (LR) will win in the first round, with P\u00e9cresse (LR) winning in the second round.  1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_French_presidential_election#Declared\n2. https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211204-france-s-conservative-les-r%C3%A9publicains-choose-moderate-val%C3%A9rie-p%C3%A9cresse-as-2022-presidential-candidate\n3. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59590518\n4. https://elabe.fr/presidentielle-2022-5/\n5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_French_presidential_election#Macron_vs._P%C3%A9cresse"], [103666, "2021-12-10T19:31:31Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99780, "2021-12-10T17:10:19Z", [0.13, 0.61, 0.19, 0.0, 0.07], ""], [11885, "2021-12-10T11:53:53Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2021-12-10T10:46:18Z", [0.07, 0.55, 0.04, 0.01, 0.33], ""], [101031, "2021-12-10T04:56:11Z", [0.2, 0.32, 0.26, 0.0, 0.22], "Can Pecresse out-macron Macron?\nBBC News - Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse: Part-Thatcher, part-Merkel and wants to run France\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59590518"], [96233, "2021-12-09T23:35:59Z", [0.25, 0.47, 0.08, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [86607, "2021-12-09T15:21:14Z", [0.01, 0.77, 0.21, 0.0, 0.01], "Poll shows Pecresse tied for second"], [100653, "2021-12-09T09:55:30Z", [0.07, 0.51, 0.04, 0.02, 0.36], ""], [67403, "2021-12-09T09:53:02Z", [0.3, 0.49, 0.01, 0.0, 0.2], ""], [37566, "2021-12-09T07:11:09Z", [0.21, 0.79, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [48834, "2021-12-08T23:15:26Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [27461, "2021-12-08T22:21:59Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [103643, "2021-12-08T21:01:40Z", [0.39, 0.61, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [103610, "2021-12-08T10:00:53Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.1, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [103561, "2021-12-07T21:08:08Z", [0.1, 0.75, 0.03, 0.07, 0.05], ""], [100653, "2021-12-07T09:47:53Z", [0.07, 0.59, 0.04, 0.01, 0.29], ""], [88452, "2021-12-07T08:29:21Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [103571, "2021-12-07T04:00:32Z", [0.52, 0.14, 0.26, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [79508, "2021-12-06T17:24:58Z", [0.07, 0.76, 0.17, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [103455, "2021-12-05T19:38:39Z", [0.25, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], "Valerie P\u00e9cresse's victory at the LR internal elections is not convincing.

Zemmour has now officially launched his campaign. It's too early to tell how well this has come across but he obviously got some attention out of it. Youtube has made it necessary to verify your age to see his video, which I expect he will be able to use to his advantage since the video itself pre-empted attempts to \"silence\" him or his supporters. Zemmour has also been bundled with some personal issues (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/married-far-right-firebrand-eric-zemmour-gets-chief-aide-pregnant-0b75v6mjr) and fairly unsuccessful events abroad (e.g., London which has many French voters https://www.politico.eu/article/france-eric-zemmour-gets-muted-welcome-in-london-campaign/).\nLR have ditched Bertrand as candidate for more right wing candidates, which I am interpreting as either (i) more support for (far-)right politics within LR than previously assumed or (ii) a reaction to Zemmour and trying to position themselves in a way that avoids leaking too many votes to Zemmour. (Likely, it is a combination of both.) This supports the idea that if Zemmour makes the second round he could take many of the first round LR votes with him to the second round. With the two possible LR candidates being unexpected to the extent that is little polling that includes them, it's too early to really tell whether they actually have a better chance of reaching the second round (or winning) than Bertrand, but there is no evidence to suggest this at the moment. Rather, it seems like the Zemmour/RN/LR vote will be further split and, in my opinion, more likely to be taken by the more extreme candidate for those further right, which is Zemmour, and Macron for the more moderate right wing voters.\nMacron is still to officially announce his candidacy but is stable in polls despite Zemmour now being a clear candidate, suggesting that his base is solid. Seeing the impact of the results over in LR will be interesting to determine whether LR voters aligned with Bertrand will shift to Macron or remain LR voters and, by extension, possible second round Zemmour voters. As a result, I've given a higher score to LREM, which for now seems to have been unaffected by Zemmour's campaign launch, and a slightly lower score to Zemmour whose campaign has not been able to capitalise on his rise in the polls and make him the established second round candidate."], [79142, "2021-12-02T15:57:19Z", [0.16, 0.56, 0.14, 0.04, 0.1], "First Round\nEn Marche 25 23 23 25 23\nNR ..............20 16 17 18 20\nLR ...............15 14 13 12 14\nLFI ..............10 10 07 09 10\nNONE ........15 17 15 14 13\nCandidats \u00c9ric Zemmour Marine Le Pen Xavier Bertrand Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\nEmmanuel Macron ....60 54 54 56 62\nCandidat concurrent .40 46 46 44 38"], [86607, "2021-12-02T15:11:54Z", [0.03, 0.86, 0.04, 0.01, 0.06], "The best polling Republicain for the general was just defeated in the primary.

Notably Macron wins in all the hypothetical head-to-heads with 55% or greater, and has shown improvement in his matchups against Zemmour and Bertrand. Further breakdowns are interesting, where survey-takers are asked how they will vote in various scenarios if their 1st round candidate does not advance. Perhaps the most promising news for Macron is that Bertrand's first-round voters are more likely to favor him to Zemmour, 48-21%. The same voters prefer Macron to Le Pen, 47-19%. This suggests the two \"extreme right\" candidates will not be able to consolidate the more mainstream right-wing voters, who prefer the bland technocratic approach of Macron. Likewise, if Bertrand advances, a majority of both Zemmour and Le Pen voters announce their intentions to abstain in the second round. In short, even though there are more voters to Macron's right than his left, they are just as fractious and unwilling to accept (at this early stage) alternate standard-bearers.

I am basing my prediction based on the following points. (i) Le Pen (RN candidate) does not have a chance of winning as far as I can tell. With respect to the first round, she is polling much lower than in 2017 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_French_presidential_election#Graphical_summary), where she relied primarily on past Le Pen voters and to a smaller extent on other right wing voters and neither left nor right voters. There are many right wing alternatives to her in the upcoming election, which will split her voter base.  Even if she reached the second round, she still polls unfavourably against Macron (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_French_presidential_election#Macron_vs._Le_Pen) and has already lost to him once. (ii) Macron (LREM candidate) is the current president. French presidents do not normally win a second term (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_France#Presidents_2). In what may turn out to be history rhyming, the last one to do so (Chirac, 2002) did so against Le Pen's father because of how despised Le Pen's father was. Macron is not polling particularly well, neither in the presidential polls nor in his approval ratings as president (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_on_the_Emmanuel_Macron_presidency#Graphical_summary), although they have improved recently. Macron could market himself as a choice for stability following the (ongoing) covid-19 crisis and the opportunity to announce radical policies. His opponents are also fairly divided and splitting the everything-but-macron vote between each other. On the other hand, he could also face a resurgence of the gillet jaunes movement if his government fails to address new and pre-existing problems. The fact that Macron has not yet officially announced his intention to seek re-election means that he may be waiting for more positive polls or some announcement that he expects to move pools in his favour. (I do not have data on how early or late outgoing french presidents officially announce they are seeking re-election.) (iii) Bertrand (LR) could look like an alternative choice to Le Pen for traditional, small c, right wing voters, but Macron has himself movedto the right(as opposed to his more centrist position in 2017) and is currently more popular. The crowd seems to give Bertrand a chance, but to me there is no evidence that he has it in him to run a successful enough campaign to make up his current deficit. The only circumstances that could be favourable to him would be if Macron decided not to seek re-election. He has been polling well against Macron himself in a second round scenario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2022_French_presidential_election#Macron_vs._Bertrand) so it seems plausible that he would be able to rack up some Macron votes if Macron were not around. (iv) Melenchon has not managed to rally a popular left wing movement and is polling even worse than in 2017. He did have a late surge in the polls in 2017, but it was not enough to make it to the second round and I don't believe it would be enough to make it to the second round this time either. Should he reach the second round he would lose with a very high probability as he does not have a broad support base and could face every other candidate aligning against him, or at the very least not supporting him. (v) France is quite socially conservative and uncomfortable with issues of race, religion, and sexism. There are no social justice oriented candidates with broad support, and even Macron has increasingly leaned into right wing narratives on these issues rather than towards more progressive views. (v) Zemmour's recent surge in the polls, despite not being an official candidate, suggests that there is a real voter base for an \"right wing outsider, anti-establishment candidate that tells it like it is\". Being a well known journalist, author and media personality that is accustomed to live TV debates, Zemmour has the potential to run a successful media campaign. \nMacron in 2017 benefitted from marketing himself as a modern outsider to the political establishment and proposing a change from the french political establishment. In the end, Macron has maybe suffered from turning out to be too much like the establishment that people wanted to get rid of. Zemmour is even more of an outsider, with more extreme views in many regards (particularly on racism, islam, feminism, and LGBT+ issues) that will fetch the far right vote, but he also seems to be able to capture some of the broader dissatisfied-with-the-system vote that he has been able to reach through his media work and existing notoriety. His views are not necessarily unpopular with french voters.\nIf Zemmour succeeds in taking over more of Le Pen's voters along with some other right wing voters that do not like Macron and Melenchon voters, he would be in a good position to reach the second round. If that happens, it seems that Zemmour will face the same hostility that Le Pen's father did in 2002 (which allowed Chirac to win despite his unpopularity) because he already is well established and accepted. Considering Macron's unpopularity, this leaves the door open for a second round Zemmour win in my opinion.\n"], [93028, "2021-10-21T19:27:37Z", [0.01, 0.89, 0.01, 0.01, 0.08], ""], [103026, "2021-10-21T17:10:33Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25], "Macron wins over Eric Zemmour, who makes it through but who's policies are seen as unpalatable by the majority."], [81262, "2021-10-21T12:47:10Z", [0.0, 0.79, 0.0, 0.0, 0.21], "Hasn't been an incumbent winning for 20 years; However, 'fringe' candidates, such as far right,l are weeded out in 2nd round "], [93350, "2021-10-21T10:11:55Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3], "Zemmour is yet to announce he is running for president, but he expected to announce the name of his new political party with a 200-page manifesto being near to completion.\nMacron\u2019s success in 2017 involved the creation of a new political party, which set the precedent for electorate\u2019s weariness of the status quo.\n He has the ability to unite the right in what is a conservative country.
