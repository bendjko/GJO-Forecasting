After discussion with @ctsats, it seems wise to reduce the bin 1 forecast: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1368964 The crux of the matter is that the UKHSA changed the case definitions; the new case definitions went into effect on Dec 14. A probable case is now \"COVID-19 PCR positive and i) SGTF^^ or ii) 69-70 deletion with specimen dates from 1 December\" (from the Dec 15 daily report; also as found by @paulm originally). Also, they don't seem to be genotyping Omicron cases using their standard genotyping assay. So the only Omicron cases in the Dec 17 weekly report are sequenced: 10,017 cases. Meanwhile, there are an additional ~19k probable cases. This question would resolve next week if they included all of those. It's somewhat understandable that they're not including their probable cases in this week's report as the case definitions changed partway through the week. But are they going to start including them next week or not? If they don't, then this question would almost certainly take longer to resolve. The week starting Nov 21, they sequenced 58k samples. The following week, 61k. Looking at the pattern at https://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/cog-uk/ , I think we can expect the number of sequenced samples to grow at most slightly through the rest of the year and possibly fall because of the holidays. Maybe 64k for the week starting Dec 5, more for successive weeks, maybe less during the holidays. If only sequenced data are used to resolve this question, nearly all of next week's and the following week's sequences would need to be Omicron. And if the number sequenced falls in the week after Christmas, it won't happen. So, I'm adjusting far lower until we know whether they're including SGTF data next week. If they do include SGTF data starting in next week's report, then the question will resolve in bin 1, and my Brier score will be damaged. If they don't, it'll also be less than ideal.

Of the total cases, 48% are estimated to be Omicron [3], with forecasts predicting that Omicron will soon outpace all other variants in infection rates [4].  If we use the spread of Alpha and Delta as our base rates, caveated with Omicron's more pernicious ability to spread a reasonable prediction ought to be likely. Alpha cases took from the 4th Jan to the 30th April to reach 100,000 cases. [5] This is 117 days. The Delta case took from circa March 2nd to June 25th to reach 100,000 cases [4,5,6]. This is 116 days. With both of these being approximately similar despite Delta being a more pervasive and quickly spreading variant, one might postulate that the government measures implemented [7] were able to somewhat stifle the spread of COVID-19. My base rate is therefore 116.5 days from the first case to 100,000. This would put the predicted 100,000 case rate at 24th March 2022. However, Delta took 91 days to become the most prolific variant [4]. Whereas Omicron has taken just 18 days to reach 48% of total cases [2]. With cases of the Omicron variant forecasted to double every 2-3 days [8] one might reasonably assume that within 21 days it will be the largest variant.  With the WHO, Oxford University and WSJ all touting [9,10,11] that the Omicron variant can lower the immune system and people that are vaccinated are still not immune (the benefits being lowered risk of severe condition or death), it is reasonable to assume that the Omicron variant is not limited to infecting the unvaccinated populus.  If we do the calculations based on Omicron doubling every 2.5 days with a current rate of roughly 5,000 (that are reported - we are assuming that the 100,000 mark is only surpassed on reported cases as some suggest we are already passed on non-reported).\n+2.5 days = 10k total cases\n+2.5 = 20k\n+2.5 = 40k\n+2.5 = 80k\n+2.5 = 160k This would indicate that within 11 days we will surpass the total of 100,000 cases caused by the Omicron variant alone. This takes us to the 26th December. To do some dialectical bootstrapping - basically to make sure I'm not under confirmation bias, let's look at why it may take much longer.\nSchools and Universities are mostly still in session [12] meaning that young people are still socialising a lot and on return to their homes, from circa 17th Dec there may once again be a relative drop off in the number of cases.\nWith COVID restrictions having been more focused on testing with free offers from the govt [13] e.g. for workplaces, parties, travel - there may be an increase in the % of cases that were reported which may once again fall as people go home for Christmas and no longer test as regularly.\nWorkplace Christmas parties (no puns on BoJo for now) have mainly taken place prior to the governments' announcements and have not explicitly been banned meaning that a spike in cases may have been seen at so-called 'super spreader' work parties [14] with rates falling once people go home. In spite of this, there is nationwide distrust of the UK government, including calls for a vote of no-confidence [15] and the police are fearing backlash of non compliance by the public [16]. This may mean that people feel less guilty or perceive a lesser social stigma around breaking the rules.  I would therefore anticipate that whilst the 26th December is likely the earliest that we might expect to see 100,000 cases, the first week of January with returns to offices, schools and therefore increased testing is the more likely time to have 100,000 actually reported. I would therefore place a 37% potential with it being ahead of the 30th December and a 59% potential before the end of January with just 3% remaining split over the following months.

Everything is pointing to question resolution in the Dec 31 report (data through Dec 29, the last report in bin 1), with the only question in my mind being about how many samples get analyzed over the holidays. But I think there would need to be a radical drop for 100k not to be genetically characterized by then. Current UKHSA Omicron totals found by @ctsats: https://twitter.com/UKHSA/status/1470405213739786254\nAs of Dec 13, 4713 total Omicron cases and 1576 new daily total cases. The UKHSA tweets do say that those are \"confirmed\" Omicron cases, suggesting that they are sequenced cases, not just cases with SGTF. The new daily total on Dec 12 was 1239, total 3137. The new daily total on Dec 11 was 633, total 1898. Estimating exponential growth based on these numbers, I'd expect we'd see just under 9k sequenced, confirmed Omicron cases total included in the Dec 17 report (for data through Dec 15). But of course they don't break out the numbers by confirmed + probable. I'm not sure what fraction of Omicron cases will be genotyped, but these would obviously be on top of the sequence totals. Given that sequenced cases represented about 37% of all genetically characterized cases last week (= ~43k/116k * 100%), and that there were only ~560 Omicron cases total last week, I expect we could see as many as ~560 + ~8300/0.37 = ~23.0k confirmed + probable Omicron cases in the Dec 17 report, depending on how much Omicron genotyping they're doing. So I think we'll likely see in the ballpark of 9k-23k total Omicron cases in the Dec 17 report, probably closer to 23k. Things are moving up quickly. The same exponential curve (which will likely need to be adjusted as new data come in and also the number of samples sequenced each week changes) would predict a total of ~34k sequenced Omicron cases by Dec 22. Assuming sequenced cases still represent 37% of confirmed + probable cases (which won't stay constant), I'd currently expect in the ballpark of 92k total Omicron cases in the Dec 24 report.

The current cases seem to be widely distributed so it seems certain that its here to stay. So the real question is the rate of spread... and we've only got South Africa to base numbers off of, and they have a very different vaccination rate. Early data is pointing to a 25% relative risk of re-infection in the unvaccinated who previously had the disease (Delta was 9%). Plus infections are rising faster than in any previous wave. https://www.ft.com/content/e742a4bf-3e72-4551-bf72-df73cb35436f So, what's the R value? \"In late November, South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg determined that R was above 2 in Gauteng. [] Gauteng\u2019s R value was well below 1 in September \u2014 when Delta was the predominant variant and cases were falling \u2014 suggesting that Omicron has the potential to spread much faster and infect vastly more people than Delta.

(although it's unlikely to be sustainable at that rate). Which puts it at 8-9 weeks out, which is in line with @kevins note that Delta took 56 days. So that puts dominance at the end of January. Vaccination rates are much higher now, and we can respond faster, so if trouble really shows soon we're better set to respond. I'd think we're more likely to be on the later end of that (fingers crossed). Though it doesn't necessarily need to be dominant to cross 100k total numbers and that would likely happen sooner. This question will change fast as data becomes available, so will need monitoring, but I'll guess pre-Jan 26 is more likely at this point, although not overwhelmingly so"], [691, "2021-12-04T15:53:58Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.19, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [33873, "2021-12-04T15:02:36Z", [0.2, 0.65, 0.08, 0.04, 0.03], ""], [33873, "2021-12-04T15:00:49Z", [0.3, 0.55, 0.08, 0.04, 0.03], "Currently ~300,000 infections/week in UK, mostly Delta.

Published on April 19th https://inews.co.uk/news/health/indian-variant-cases-new-covid-strain-uk-figures-latest-news-963434 gives a good base case for us being at a similar point right now - less than 200 cases of Delta in the UK at that point. There is a caveat here in that there were generally less cases in the population at that point, less than 2000/day. But we also had NPI restrictions in place.  If we take the Delta strain as an example and extrapolate, and estimate that we were at 1% of cases being Omicron today:\n- By 18th we will be at 10%\n- By the 1st Jan we will be at 33% Assuming constant number of cases (e.g. 300k a week)\n- Right now 400/day\n- 18th we will be getting 4000/day\n- 1st Jan 12,500/day With that growth we'd expect 75,000 cases by Jan 1st. Omicron doesn't have to grow twice as quickly to reach 100,000 before then. In April and May Delta tended to displace Alpha's share of infections before actually increasing the raw number of infections. I think we're likely to see a similar story. Still a lot of unknowns around how vaccine/natural immunity evasive Omicron is, so I'm putting the majority of belief into it being early Jan before we have 100,000 cases, but I think there is a good chance we see this happen in December given the amount of mixing expected and lack of NPIs.

It almost certainly has some advantage that's allowing it to spread as well as it is, but we don't yet know what that advantage is.  It lacks most of Delta's mutations, so may in fact turn out to be weaker in other respects (e.g. infectiousness or vaccine resistance).  We should not assume it will have the same success in the UK as in South Africa (differences in population demographics, vaccination rate, natural immunity rate, culture, climate, population density...).  All this is to say, I don't think it's quite a given yet that Omicron will become widespread in the UK (10% chance it doesn't).

A few forecasters seem to be mixing up reported cases with those that are genetically characterised. Dealing with reported cases only, I'm adjusting from SA data on transmission to give a doubling rate approx 4.5-6 days due to the different environment and context, particularly the low vaccination level in SA. From 134 current reported cases, I'd estimate 8-12k reported by year end. In terms of prevalence that could be 3-5%, with Delta cases still at 40-45k/day, unless further mitigation is started promptly (unlikely given the Government track record for additional mandates only as a last resort).  Translating this into confirmed or probable genotyped samples, 3-5% would equate to 2,500-4,000 samples out of approx 90k/wk. Sampling rates vary but maximum capacity looks to be 95k/wk, having increased from ~50k six months ago as a new facility (the Rosalind Franklin Laboratory) gets fully up to speed. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rosalind-franklin-laboratory-processes-one-millionth-pcr-test From this level January results are likely to show Omicron gaining prevalence quickly, particularly through vaccine immunity escape and some greater transmissibility compared to Delta. I'd expect at least 3-4 weeks for Omicron to reach 50% dominance in this context even so. If sampling backs this up, then we could exceed 100k either in the 3rd week of January (fastest likely) or by 1st week in February (slowest likely). Given the report date to 26th Jan is within bin 2, this does look the favourite, but any slower rate will go into bin3, so it's still open. Caveats: there may be some query around the number of  'probable' cases of  Omicron due to the \"S-gene dropout\" which can help quickly establish likelihood, but not confirmation. Full genomic sequencing would still be needed, so this is perhaps not a big factor to this question. The general public will take some self-imposed precautions but without clear guidance and mandates this won't be enough to prevent Omicron spreading. More drastic measures could well be imposed after Christmas, similar to last year, as the Government belatedly recognises that the NHS is under much more pressure than it has acknowledged, and that cases and deaths have not improved.

For reference, Delta became dominant in less than two months and is considered ~1.5 times more likely to cause an infection compared to Alpha in the UK (https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/delta-variant-60-percent-more-contagious-original-virus-and-evades-immunity).

For those of you who are new to these data, here's a key point to keep in mind: this question isn't asking when there will be >100k cases in the UK that are caused by Omicron. It's asking when >100k samples will be genetically characterized as Omicron cases. As only a portion of cases are genetically characterized each week, this question asks 1) how fast Omicron is going to spread in the UK relative to Delta, and 2) when that will lead to >100k Omicron cases being genetically characterized.  UK labs characterized just under 76k samples last week. The number characterized stays relatively constant, so what matters most to this question is the week-by-week percentage of cases that Omicron represents. Omicron cases currently represent about 0.3% of cases in England, so I'll go with that as the best currently available prevalence data for the UK. The current data on the website are for cases up to Nov 17, and there are zero reported Omicron cases up to then. The UK currently reports ~44k cases/day; 0.003 * 44k = 132. So, seeding with ~132 cases today (it won't be completely accurate, but it's a starting point), with cases quadrupling in just over a week (South African data), we should see somewhere in the ballpark of 18k cases by Dec 29. If the UK continues to see ~44k/day Delta cases, then these will be a small fraction of total cases and hence a small fraction of the genetically characterized cases. I think this makes bin 1 extremely unlikely. Delta will likely peak in early January, but Omicron won't. Omicron cases will likely rise dramatically in the UK in January unless substantial mitigations are put in place. It is starting to look like it's more contagious than Delta, and it largely escapes existing immunity, so in the absence of serious mitigations, it will likely spread like wildfire. While there might be, say, ~0.6M Delta cases in January (probably an overestimate), there could be >2M Omicron cases (or more) in the UK in January, depending on exactly how well Omicron spreads and whether the UK government and people attempt to mitigate its spread. If there were 2M Omicron cases and 0.6M Delta cases in January before Jan 26, then Omicron cases would represent 77% of all cases in January. And there could even be close to 4M Omicron cases in January in the absence of mitigations; I sincerely hope that they do put some mitigations in place before everything gets out of control. In any case, if 76k cases/week are genetically characterized, and at least half of them are Omicron cases starting in early January, then even with mitigations, over 4 * 76k/2 = 152k Omicron cases might be characterized by Jan 26. In fact, if there are even 3 weeks in Jan where Omicron represents at least 1/2 of all cases (and I don't currently see how this won't happen), then 100k will be reached. I think this makes bin 2 extremely likely. Mitigations may delay the appearance of 100k cases in the UK data until later bins, so I will assign some probability to those.
