Also, the current price is about 25 times annual sales, and a year ago the stock was trading for $422/sh.    On the other hand, revenue has increase by about 2.5 times year over year.  I found an article on yahoo finance that said in just the last few years about 50 percent of the 600 million people in their market place have  gone from 100 percent cash to becoming \"banked\" (e.g., have access to bank accounts, pre-paid cards, investing through Mercado Fondo).   The head of investor relations said Mercado Libre is well positioned to take advantage of this development.  Therefore, the stock is in a bubble, but there is still at least some very positive press.  At about 25 times sales and a negative p/e, the stock price should fall even if the revenue doubled again.     I remember from the dot.com boom (I live in silicon valley so I probably remember it better than most), it took a while for the public to stop pumping money into overpriced stocks.  I remember talking to people about how overpriced a particular stock was and how they were still going to buy it because it was still going up.    Hence, speculation (aka the greater fool theory) is still alive and well.
