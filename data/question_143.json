For those who do get sick, the illness is often mild, and there is no treatment.\nBut Zika can pose a dire risk to pregnant women. It targets developing nerve cells in fetuses and can lead to a birth defect called microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and brain damage.

Rio state declares financial emergency, requests funding for Olympics \nhttps://www.yahoo.com/sports/news/rio-state-declares-financial-emergency-requests-funding-olympics-005430624--oly.html RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor declared a state of financial emergency Friday and requested federal funds to help fulfill obligations for public services during the Olympics that start Aug. 5. Emergency measures are needed to avoid \u201ca total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management,\u201d a decree in the state\u2019s Official Gazette said. The state\u2019s revenue, largely tied to the petroleum industry, slumped in the last two years as global oil prices collapsed. The announcement followed this week\u2019s visit to Rio by Brazil\u2019s Interim President Michel Temer, who said the federal government would ensure all obligations are met for a successful Games. Rio is expecting about 500,000 foreign visitors during the Olympics, which has coincided with Brazil\u2019s worst recession since the 1930s and a political crisis that last month led to the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff. \u201cThe state\u2019s financial emergency in no way delays the delivery of Olympic projects and the promises assumed by the city of Rio,\u201d Mayor Eduardo Paes said on Twitter. He also underscored that legacy construction projects, with the exception of an 8.79 billion-real expansion of Rio\u2019s metro that is expected to be finished just days before the Games open, are the responsibility of the city and that most have been completed. The local organizing committee for the Games said the state\u2019s fiscal situation did not impact its actual running of the Olympics, which relies entirely on private funds. While the majority of Olympic infrastructure costs have been spread across city, state and federal budgets, with some financing from private companies, the state is responsible for most day-to-day security and health services in Rio. The financial pinch resulted in a 30-percent cut in the state\u2019s security budget - just as Rio has seen a jump in homicides and assaults in recent months, raising concerns about safety ahead of the Olympics. The state of Rio expects a budget deficit of over 19 billion reais ($5.56 billion) this year as spending planned before oil prices fell outstrips revenue that is tumbling during Brazil\u2019s recession. Rio state\u2019s debt has been downgraded several times. On Wednesday, Fitch Ratings downgraded Rio\u2019s debt rating to \u2018B-\u2019 from 'B+\u2019, saying the state was suffering \u201ca fast-deteriorating liquidity position.\" Since late last year, the state has been forced to delay pension and salary payments and shutter some schools and hospitals, where crucial supplies, including medicines and syringes, are lacking. Brazil is also facing an outbreak of the Zika virus, which has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly in which babies are born with abnormally small heads frequently associated with developmental issues.

The W.H.O. previously told them to avoid any area where Zika is circulating. \"Some attendees may contract the mosquito-borne infection and even bring it back home, but the risk in August \u2014 midwinter in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 is relatively low, W.H.O. officials said. \"Travel related to the Olympics accounts for only a fraction of the travel already occurring to and from countries with Zika transmission, the officials noted. Mass gatherings like the World Cup or the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca \u201ccan amplify a disease or can raise the risk that it will spread to other countries,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is leading the W.H.O. response to Zika. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss that, but the committee felt there should be a much lower risk from the Olympics.\u201d \"The W.H.O. was acting on the advice of its emergency committee, but essentially repeated the Olympics-related travel advice it gave on May 12, which implied that the Games should go on. The agency expects Zika to spread from northern Argentina to the southern United States whether or not the Games take place. \"The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spread Zika are rare in Europe and in nontropical regions of North America. . . .  \"Dr. Karin Nielsen, an infectious disease pediatrician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is studying Zika infections in Rio de Janeiro with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, said the foundation had reported no new cases in nearly eight weeks since the weather began cooling. Mosquito-borne diseases \u201crun a cycle and are not continuously present, so Zika should not be a problem for the Olympics,\u201d she said. \"But other experts disagreed.\n. . . \n\". . . the W.H.O.. . . . did not [advise postponing travel to affected areas], but said that officials in Brazil should \u201ccontinue to intensify\u201d mosquito control and that insect repellent, condoms and health advice should be available for all athletes and visitors. \" . . . the W.H.O. was \u201cbetting on the weather, responsible behavior by visitors, adequate mosquito control and a low sexual-transmission rate by returning visitors. All are gambles.\u201d \"Also on Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a proposed plan for fighting Zika if it starts spreading in the continental United States. The agency expects some local mosquito transmission this summer in Florida and along the Gulf Coast to Texas. The plan outlines steps if even one case appears. Because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes do not fly far, officials can provide \u201ca large margin of safety\u201d by concentrating efforts within a one-mile circle around each known infection, the plan said. One case, with no further transmission, would require a 45-day effort, the C.D.C. said. But if the infection spreads, the agency will help local officials investigate and warn residents. If needed, it will send emergency teams. \"The W.H.O. convened its emergency committee by phone to consider the Olympics because, under regulations adopted in 2007, the declaration of an international public health emergency requires that the committee that recommended it meet every three months to assess the situation. \"On Feb. 1, the committee advised the W.H.O. director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, to declare an emergency over the possibility that the Zika virus had caused a cluster of birth defects in large numbers of babies in Brazil.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This statement appears to me to be very comprehensive.

During our discussions it became clear that infection with the Zika virus, unlike other arbovirus infections including dengue and chikungunya, causes a fairly mild disease with fever, malaise, and at times a maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, or both. Additional information from previous outbreaks suggested that about 20% of people infected with Zika virus develop these symptoms, and that the rest are asymptomatic. Fatality from Zika virus infection is thought to be rare. Our advice to declare a PHEIC was rather made on the basis of what is not known about the clusters of microcephaly, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and possibly other neurological defects reported by country representatives from Brazil and retrospectively from French Polynesia that are associated in time and place with outbreaks of Zika infection\" \"Since the Director-General declared the PHEIC on microcephaly and neurological disorders, many of us have had questions about how our recommendation relates to the PHEIC called by the Director-General for the 2014 Ebola outbreaks in west Africa based on the recommendation of a different Emergency Committee. The answer to us is clear. The Director-General declared the Ebola outbreaks a PHEIC because of what science knew about the Ebola virus from many years of research during outbreaks in the past, whereas she declared the current PHEIC because of what is not known about the current increase in reported clusters of microcephaly and other disorders, and how this might relate to concurrent Zika outbreaks.\nWe were told by the Director-General that she would convene us again within 3 months to reassess the situation, as required under the International Health Regulations. We are confident that virtual meetings will allow us to review global collective action and to learn from WHO about progress in understanding the present situation of microcephaly and neurological disorders and progress in implementation of the precautionary and preparatory measures related to Zika.\nWe are all members of the WHO Emergency Committee on Zika virus and observed increase in neurological disorders and neonatal malformations. \""], [1993, "2016-02-19T10:25:57Z", [0.05], "I can't imagine the CDC raising the warning to Level 3, as that would imply that the Zika virus is considered a threat to all travelers, whereas only pregnant women (or their fetuses) are in danger of serious harm.

The period of transmissibility to the fetus appears to be limited to the period when it is viremic, that is while it is still present in blood prior to its elimination by the immune system. There is incontrovertible evidence that it can cross the blood-placenta barrier, hence the incidence of microcephaly. There is some very limited evidence that it may persist in semen for some time after the initial infection and elimination from the bloodstream, and may allow for secondary infection by sexual transmission after the infected male has recovered and is asymptomatic. Beyond that possibility there does not appear to be another reservoir in the body that would allow for continued shedding of the virus after infection.
