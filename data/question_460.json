On August 8th Kenyans will pick a president, governors, MPs and senators. Yet instead of being excited about the chance to elect a new government, many are terrified. On July 31st Chris Msando, the chief technician in charge of the electronic voting system, was found dead in Nairobi, the capital, his arm broken and his body displaying signs of torture. Who killed Mr Msando is far from clear. The opposition blames the government, and several analysts suspect they are right. The killing removes one of the few people trusted to ensure that the voting system works. It also sends a message to other electoral officials that they, too, are at risk. Kenya\u2019s democracy is one of the most vibrant and competitive in Africa. But that comes at a price. Elections are bitterly fought and often violent. The results are nearly always disputed. This murder suggests that this year will be no different. At worst, it raises fears that violence of the sort that led to the deaths of perhaps 1,400 people and paralysed the country after the 2007 election could happen again. The incumbent this year is Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya\u2019s first president following independence in 1963. Mr Kenyatta took over in 2013, the first election after the violence, by making a pact with William Ruto, a populist politician from the Rift Valley. After the 2007 election the pair were investigated and indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Mr Kenyatta, who belongs to Kenya\u2019s biggest tribe, the Kikuyu, was accused of organising the mass killing of people from other tribes; Mr Ruto, who is from the Kalenjin, the third-biggest group, was accused of organising the murder of Kikuyus. Yet in 2013 they fought a joint campaign in which they claimed that the charges were part of a Western-led plot to take over Kenya. They won easily. The ICC charges were later dropped, after key witnesses vanished. This time, Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto ought to be ahead again by a wide margin. As incumbents they have the power of patronage. Most Kenyans vote on tribal lines; politicians win by delivering goodies to their ethnic kin. This is not only done by targeting government spending; many politicians use money looted from the state to pay off local leaders who deliver votes en masse. Well-funded ones can afford helicopters to whizz them around the country, and gifts for voters, as well as cars to take them to the polls. Per head, campaign spending in Kenya may exceed that of America, a country 40 times richer. Yet their pitch seems have fallen flat, at least outside their strongholds, where they can still draw thousands. At a rally in Nairegie Enkare, a small town at the edge of the Masai Mara game reserve, your correspondent counted six helicopters and twice as many brightly branded SUVs. But the crowd, all sporting baseball caps in the red of Jubilee, Mr Kenyatta\u2019s party, was thin. \u201cThis is less people than a local council meeting,\u201d mocked Jackson Surun, standing at the edge of the crowd. \u201cThey bring these people from somewhere. No one here will vote for him.\u201d The opposition meanwhile has unified. It is led by Raila Odinga, the son of another independence-era stalwart, Oginga Odinga. Mr Odinga is from the Luo, a tribe whose members feel they have been underrepresented in government since independence. He spent much of the 1980s in prison, accused of organising a failed coup. He lost elections in 2007 and 2013, in each case claiming to have been cheated. At 72 years old, this is (presumably) his last chance to be president. Mr Kenyatta\u2019s first term has not been a complete disaster. A new Chinese-built railway connecting the coast to Nairobi opened in May; new roads have stretched across the country; electrification and internet access have spread quickly. But corruption is still endemic; Kenya remains tied up in a vicious war in next-door Somalia, and growth has not created many formal jobs. And this year the cost of food has spiked, thanks to a drought. As a result, though most polls still put Mr Kenyatta ahead, they are a lot closer than expected. This heightens the tension. Mr Odinga \u201cis desperate to achieve victory\u201d, says Murithi Mutiga, an analyst with International Crisis Group, an NGO. \u201cNot only him but his own ethnic community, the Luos, who feel unfairly excluded, marginalised for five decades, their best leaders assassinated\u2026they feel this is their last chance.\u201d Conversely, if Mr Kenyatta loses, it will threaten his family\u2019s substantial business interests. For Mr Ruto, who wants to stand for president in 2022, it would be worse: \u201cHis career will almost certainly be over.\u201d In the 2013 election Mr Kenyatta was accused of rigging the vote to ensure he did not have to fight a second round (under Kenya\u2019s constitution, if no candidate wins more than 50% there is a run-off). But few doubted he was genuinely ahead. And though Mr Odinga disputed the result, he did so at Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, while encouraging his supporters to stay at home. This time things could be bumpier. In January Mr Odinga told reporters \u201cwe are not going to take it lying down\u201d if the election is rigged. Some of his allies go further. \u201cIf they steal this election, this country will burn,\u201d says Ledama Olekina, a candidate in Narok County. Mr Odinga and co refuse to say what they will do if they deem the election to have been stolen\u2014but they have made it clear that this is what they expect. For over a year, they have claimed to reveal ever more dastardly plots to rig the vote. At their rallies, a popular chant is \u201cno Raila, no peace\u201d. In Nairobi\u2019s slums, where some of the worst violence was concentrated in 2007, people are already nervous. \u201cI will be leaving very soon,\u201d says Catherine Kalekye, sitting braiding a child\u2019s hair at the edge of Mathare, a neighbourhood of tin-roofed shacks in the east of the city. Many people are going to the countryside; others have moved within the slum to be closer to their kinsfolk. \u201cWe will go to Kiambu and leave the men to fight,\u201d says Jane Wambui, a 40-year-old Kikuyu clothes trader. She fears Luos will seize the opportunity of protests to take revenge on their (typically Kikuyu) landlords. \u201cIt is not safe\u2026they could come and rape me, rape my daughter.\u201d Yet despite the fears, there are reasons to hope the fallout will be manageable. Some 180,000 soldiers, police and even national-park rangers have been drafted in to maintain security. In 2007 the worst violence happened in the Rift Valley, where a host of tribes live side by side, nursing deep resentment over the allocation of land that dates back to colonial days. Today, the two most powerful groups, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, are in an uneasy peace. Unfortunately, even a peaceful election is unlikely to bring much relief in the long run. If Mr Kenyatta wins, his second term will be dominated by a succession battle. Corruption will persist. And, come 2022, the country will witness the same vicious battle over the spoils of government.

Observers are concerned about possible unrest after the polls. Distrust is the best word to describe Kenya's political mood ahead of the upcoming elections. Just as the country was getting ready for the first presidential debate ahead of the elections, President Uhuru Kenyatta pulled out. When the last election was held four years ago he complained that the moderators' questions were biased. His main opponent, Raila Odinga, followed suit and the debate was postponed. The move is symptomatic of Kenya's heated campaigning period, which has seen the debate over political reforms and development take a back seat. On August 8, Kenyans will not only elect the next president, they will also vote for new governors, senators and local governments. Kenya's two major political camps, Kenyatta's Jubilee party and Odinga's National Super Alliance (NASA), generally adhere to ethnic and regional lines. Both sides complain of systematic discrimination through political influence in the media and the electoral bodies. And both sides believe that the other will try to use irregularities in the voting system to rig election results in their respective strongholds. According to a recent audit by the consulting firm KPMG, 80,000 ghost voters were removed from the electoral register.  However, KPMG suspects that up to one million more deceased voters could still be on the register. \"Ethnic and political polarization\" Kenya's opposition contested the results in both the 2013 and 2007 elections. The protests and violence that followed the 2007 elections left up to 1,000 people dead and many more displaced. In 2013, Odinga unsuccessfully contested the results in court. As the opposition fears manipulation through the electoral commission, NASA has this time announced that it plans to collate its own results at polling stations. Should these results differ from the official ones, there is bound to be political unrest. European Union election observers are already monitoring the situation. It's no secret that there are concerns over the possible outbreak of violence, explained Marietje Schaake who heads the mission (para. 1-7). Kuoppam\u00e4ki, A. (2017).

In 2007, polls failed as well, but the race seemed itself too close to call for any predictive effort; nevertheless, the polls missed the vote share of the winner, Kibaki, by 3 percent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyan_general_election,_2007). In 2017, polls in January showed Kenyatta clearly ahead, however, most recents polls (May 18) show that Odinga is closing in on Kenyatta. He has 40 percent; beeing only 9 percent behind Kenyatta (according to the pollster with a +/- 1,7 percent on a 95 confidence level: but this seems to exact even for developed countries - consider the French second round presidential elections; and beware of the notorious polling failures in Kenya mentioned above). Odinga is endorsed by a large national coalition: National Super Alliance (NASA). This poll is the first after his endorsment for NASA. So, there seems to be a considerable momentum in his favor (http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/05/18/raila-closing-in-on-uhuru-poll_c1562863). Next polls will be published in four weeks. Kenyatta, on the other hand, seems to be well-known, highly approved, and has no current scandals to deal with. Also, there is some speculation that voters might fear riots and violence in the aftermath of a political swing: so this could help Kenyatta. Still, there are eigth weeks to go until election day. Many thinks can happen and voting behavior in Kenya is volatile, many voteres seem to be undecided - according to what the polling institute found out. 9 percent lead for Kenyatta for eigth weeks to go: this is no clear election outcome.  Given that the former elections were very close, I do not see, why the consensus to date gives Kenyatta a 88 percent chance to win. Seems overrated to me. I think, the chances for Kenyatta are clearly not in the region as they were for Macron in the second round of the french presidential elections; he had a 20 percent lead according to pollsters two weeks before election day (95-98 percent). Probably chances are somewhere in the region of Hillary Clinton vs. Trump some four weeks before election day: around 70 percent. Given that Odinga has considerable momentum, it is probably less. ---> So I start my forecast with 66 percent: or 2 to 1 in favor of Kenyatta."], [35642, "2017-05-20T03:03:14Z", [0.59], ""], [20297, "2017-05-19T16:13:24Z", [0.9], ""], [34353, "2017-05-19T11:41:03Z", [0.9], ""], [35377, "2017-05-19T10:31:06Z", [0.56], ""], [34353, "2017-05-18T19:32:31Z", [0.9], ""], [35658, "2017-05-17T23:37:20Z", [0.89], ""], [34353, "2017-05-17T22:36:24Z", [0.9], ""], [4634, "2017-05-17T18:12:05Z", [0.78], ""], [35518, "2017-05-17T17:08:38Z", [0.95], "Odinga has failed to garner enough support to make a big political swing.
