If the State House of Representatives also passes the legislation \u2014 supporters hope to see a vote next month, and are cautiously optimistic about the outcome \u2014 then Illinois will become the 37th state to ratify the amendment. Approval by just one more state would bring the measure to the three-quarters threshold required for constitutional amendments. There are a handful of good possibilities, including Florida, Virginia and Utah.\n. . . \nThere are some questions about what will happen if a 38th state ratifies the amendment, given that it would miss the deadline Congress set by at least 36 years, and five states have even voted to rescind their ratifications.

We move the ball a little bit further down the field every year, but we need to hit the goal and be done with this,\u201d . . ..Going into the General Assembly\u2019s 60-day session, these local groups are once again lobbying to see the constitutional amendment ratified in both the Senate and House of Delegates.\n\n. . . . [the Weber's] traveled to New York City for . . .  [Eastan's] milestone 10th birthday last June, and while there, they made plans to take a picture of her standing next to the Fearless Girl statue that was still installed on Wall Street. The 4-foot bronze statue of a little girl . . . stood opposite the iconic Charging Bull sculpture and represented the need for gender equality. \u201cI loved it [the photo] because she was my kid, but neither one of us were prepared for how other people reacted to it. It is almost like she became this little living mascot for women\u2019s rights or girl\u2019s rights or just fairness in women\u2019s futures because that was the basis of that statute,\u201d .\n\n\u201cI was horrified to find out that it is OK to pay me less than a boy even though I work as hard as him, am as smart as him and am better for the job,\u201d Eastan said. \u201cAt first when my mom told me the ERA wasn\u2019t passed in Virginia but it was in other states I was confused because I thought we had equal rights already, and then in comes pow, in your face that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen the Women-Matter group asked to use Eastan\u2019s photo for this purpose, the Webers agreed. Weber said they received permission from the statue\u2019s artist to use the image in marketing materials but not State Street Corporation, which commissioned it, so it was removed from their marketing materials and what was left was her daughter standing proud.\n\nThe advocacy of a new generation, \u201cyou could feel it in that photograph,\u201d . . . . She saw the photo as showing that the message of the need for the ERA had reached a new generation and that \u201ctheir advocacy is the blood transfusion we needed.\u201d\n\nThe image is on an electronic billboard near where I-95 and I-64 meet so it could greet legislators in the General Assembly as they arrived in Richmond for the new session this month, she said.\n\nAll of the attention has surprised Eastan, who struggled to wrap her head around why her picture would be such a prominent part of the fight for women\u2019s equality, her mom said.\n\n\u201cShe really feels there are all of these older ladies who have been working on this issue for so many years. Why is she getting this attention?\u201d Weber said. \u201cI said part of what her contribution is is she has a genuine and authentic belief in this subject.\u201d\n\nOn the same billboard that displays Eastan\u2019s image is a slogan made special by Ani Hornung, a 12-year-old homeschooled Powhatan student and the daughter of Kati and Andrew Hornung.\n\nThe simple phrase \u201cNot One More GenERAtion\u201d highlights the need for the Equal Rights Amendment to be passed so another generation of girls doesn\u2019t have to experience the same kind of discrimination as those who came before, said Kati Hornung. Hornung learned that the ERA had not been ratified in Virginia several years ago but didn\u2019t really start getting involved until last year.\n\n. . . \u201cI was upset; I think it should have passed awhile ago,\u201d Ani said. \u201cI want to see the ERA passed very, very badly.\u201d So they made some homemade signs, and on one where her mom had written \u201cNot one more generation,\u201d Ani noticed ERA was in the word generation and colored them red and underlined them.\n\nDavis was at that rally in front of the General Assembly and remembers seeing Ani\u2019s homemade sign and her emphasis on the ERA in generation. \u201cI looked at that sign and I said \u2018My God it has been staring at us in the face all the time,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThe reflection of the new generation is looking at it and saying how long has this been going on? My generation is going to take care of it. She has just caught it. It came from a 12-year-old Powhatan kid, a phrase that is taking off nationally.\u201d\n\nThe involvement of the girls and young women is a good sign of more people learning about the Equal Rights Amendment simply because many people erroneously believe it already passed, Davis said. She said that far too many women don\u2019t even know this is still an issue others are fighting for on their behalf.\n\nProponents of the amendment also face arguments that the ERA is not needed anymore because the rights of women are already protected under laws such as the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act and Violence Against Women Act.\n Women\u2019s groups such as Women-Matter argue those are all laws that can be altered or repealed and have no constitutional standing. Davis cites the words of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who was interviewed by California Lawyer in a January 2011 issue and said, \"Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.\"\n\n. . . \u201cI think there is a lot of misinformation about this issue. I also think when you are used to privilege, equality feels like oppression. I feel there are a lot of people who feel that to give equality to everyone, those who enjoy privilege have to give something up,\u201d. . .  Equality is like love; the more you give the more you have.\u201d . . . Senators and delegates were invited on Monday, Jan. 16 to a screening of the documentary \u201cEqual Means Equal\u201d at the Byrd Theatre in Richmond. Supporters of the amendment will also continue to lobby on behalf of ratification during the 60-day session and especially focus on getting it out of subcommittee in the House of Delegates, Davis added.\n\n\u201cWe want the dignity of the debate. We deserve to have this long overdue conversation on the floor of both chambers with debate and with a registered vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time that every delegate in the state of Virginia is accountable to their position on this issue.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.peoplesworld.org/article/virginia-general-assembly-starts-2018-session-with-push-for-progressive-laws/ On Wednesday, January 10, the House of Delegates, the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly started off its new sixty-day session with a sharply altered balance of power. Despite recounts and disputes, the legislature has ended up with a razor-thin Republican majority. Democrats in the body are not letting that stop them from pursuing a broad agenda of progressive reforms, however. In the November elections, Democratic Party candidates, most of them solidly progressive, flipped fifteen formerly Republican seats. The Democrats came within two seats of achieving a majority in the House of Delegates, for the first time in 18 years. Going into the election, the House was split 66 Republicans to 34 Democrats, but an increase in voter turnout in the Democratic Party\u2019s social base produced a major transformation. In Northern Virginia and other areas, progressive grassroots action brought into office a whole new contingent of young delegates, many of them minorities and/or women, plus the first transgender woman ever to be elected (Danica Roem). The Democrats just missed getting an actual one vote majority. In the 94th legislative district in Southeastern Virginia, a tied election was decided by the drawing of a name from a bowl, which produced the re-election of Republican incumbent David Yancey (the defeated Democrat, Shelly Simonds, could have asked for another recount, but decided not to). In the 28th legislative district, centered on the Northern Virginia city of Fredericksburg, the Republican candidate, Robert Thomas, defeated Democrat Joshua Cole by few votes in an election marred by an error by the local election authorities, who assigned numerous voters from Democrat-strong areas to a neighboring district by mistake. Democratic voters took this result to federal court, but the judge declined to intervene, and an appeal did not prosper either. So, for now, the House of Delegates stays at 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats. The Virginia Senate, not up for election last year or this, also has a very narrow Republican majority of 21 Republicans to 19 Democrats. In last year\u2019s election, Democrats won all three of the state\u2019s elective executive offices. The new Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, was sworn in on January 13. The Democrats and the progressive grassroots organizations whose efforts made their advances possible are not discouraged by falling just short of a legislative majority. After all, in the election to the House of Delegates last year, the Democrats won a total of 53.17 percent of the vote, and the Republicans only 43.76 percent. The Democrats and the grassroots activists argue that, were it not for racially-influenced gerrymandering of districts by Republican-controlled legislatures in recent years, there would be a Democratic majority in both houses by now. And then there is the matter of vote suppression, including measures such as the difficulty of restoring voting rights to felons, and onerous voter ID regulations, to name just the two most prominent complaints. True, the slim Republican majority has allowed that party to choose the leadership of both houses and their committees, which is no small matter. But the fact that such a large change was brought about by a mobilized activist base and a resulting increase in voter turnout is demoralizing for the Republicans and very encouraging for the Democrats and the people who voted for them. Both Democrats and Republicans have noticed that the Democratic surge in 2017 could be a harbinger of a similar change in 2018. So the Democrats are motivated and energized, and the grassroots even more so. In equal measure, the Republicans appear demoralized. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the amazing number of bills already introduced in the new session of the General Assembly so far don\u2019t include the same quantum of extreme reactionary, misogynistic, homophobic, and other backward nonsense that have been Virginia Republicans\u2019 stock in trade in recent years. [Do you think we might be reading a Democrat-leaning source here??? Anne] On the other hand, a large number of progressive bills have been introduced by Democratic senators and delegates, including especially the newly elected ones. These measures will, in most cases, not only receive the support of all or almost all the Democratic senators and delegates, they are also likely to be supported by Gov. Northam. Moreover, they will have very active support from the same grassroots forces that made the change in the composition of the legislature possible. So the mere fact there is a razor-thin Republican majority is not going to discourage either the Democrats or the activists. . ..  On the women\u2019s rights front, HJ 2 would sign Virginia onto the Equal Rights Amendment, correcting an old disgrace for this state.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  this is an important issue for me, so I may be making more of these reports than is merited, however, it appears to me that a significant--larger than ever--campaign for passage of the ERA in Virginia is gaining momentum and that there's a greater chance for its passage due to changes in the legislature.

It was killed in the Senate Rules Committee. His legislative aide, Philip Scranage, said Surovell is sure the amendment has a better chance this time around.

They include the National Organization for Women, Women Matter and the American Association of University Women.

A provision of the Illinois State Constitution, which had required a supermajority of three-fifths in both legislative chambers, was found to be unconstitutional by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in the 1975 case of Dyer v.

Same sex marriage was publicly and comfortably opposed by conservative candidates.  Religious groups vehemently denounced same sex marriage.  Then one day, without much protest, same sex marriage became federally legal and widely accepted.  Gender issues are confusing to most people currently, and passing the Equal Rights Amendment may be a function of the passing of the old guard within state legislatures.  In my opinion, the best strategic option to pass the Equal Rights Amendment is for candidates in favor of the Constitution Amendment to slowly gain seats in state legislatures, then join together and ratify the Amendment.  It's an old issue, timing is the problem and I believe the Equal Rights Amendment will fail to be ratified by 38 states on or before July 1, 2018.

"], [19260, "2017-05-13T00:38:45Z", [0.1], "Let's see, looking at all the non-ratifying states that voted Democrat in any of the last five Presidential elections . . . Illinois Senate has passed, it needs 70 votes in the House, and has 67 Democrats.  There's a decent but not overwhelming chance of passage if the rules allow it, which is disputed. Virginia's Senate has passed, but the House is 66% Republican, and every recent attempt to pass the ERA there (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015) has failed. Florida has a 60% Republican Senate and a 65% Republican House, and while an ERA bill has been submitted to committee, the committee took no action on it. North Carolina's Senate is 70% Republican and its House is 62%. Arizona, while not meeting the any-of-last-five criterion, is swingy enough that it has to be considered, I guess.  It just quashed the latest attempt back at the end of April, and it has solid Republican majorities in state House and Senate. And while \"momentum\" is usually a good thing, causing the inevitable legal mess that would result (the deadline, the extended deadline, the four states that declared they rescinded their ratifications, the state that declared afterward its ratification was contingent on the original deadline) might convince legislators that they don't want to actually pass it if they're the state that would open that can of worms."], [35445, "2017-05-13T00:19:25Z", [0.62], ""], [5018, "2017-05-13T00:14:17Z", [0.25], ""], [35510, "2017-05-12T22:33:45Z", [0.4], ""], [35504, "2017-05-12T21:30:50Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2017-05-12T21:03:08Z", [1.0], ""], [38, "2017-05-12T20:12:05Z", [0.88], "This would be a cause worthy of Michele Obama, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Dianne Feinstein and others."], [38, "2017-05-12T20:00:38Z", [0.77], "Illinois & Virginia  went for HRC.  \n"], [22689, "2017-05-12T19:44:03Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2017-05-12T19:36:11Z", [0.06], "Not a promising list.  Virginia and Illinois are Maybes from a political standpoint, but not overwhelmingly likely in either case. According to Article XIV, Section 4, of the Illinois Constitution, \"The affirmative vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly shall be required to , , , ratify a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States. . . .The General Assembly shall not take action on any proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States . . .  unless a majority of the members of the General Assembly shall have been elected after the proposed amendment has been submitted for ratification.\"  There being no way this can happen before next summer, Illinois is out, even if they could muster the votes (and it's a high standard--3/5 of the membership, not just present-and-voting).\nhttp://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/con14.htm If Virginia has anything in its constitution about how to do this, I can't find it.  Must be in statute someplace.  Other states, I suspect, require extraordinary majorities for This Sort Of Thing.  Anyway, if Illinois can't meet this deadline and nobody else on that iist wants to, Virginia doesn't matter.  If anything strange happens, this number will have to go up, of course.

While Nevada has sparked the revival of this, the list of remaining states is not favorable to getting two more states. NV has Democratic controlled Senate and Assemblies. The best bets would be IL and VA. With a governor's election in VA in November, it will be worth watching to see if this gets traction as an election issue. Currently, the VA General Assembly is controlled by Republicans in both houses, so ratification would not be likely unless Democrats won a landslide in the House elections. IL has a more favorable General Assembly, and discussions are beginning about ratification, so it's more likely they might ratify in the time frame provided.
