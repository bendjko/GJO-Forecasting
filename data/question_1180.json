I do have a good understanding of the socio-political forces at play that causes these conflicts to erupt resulting to deaths. 1'000 killed civilians in a systematic manner by one of the separatist groups is a pretty tall order. The recent Marawi siege which was one of the worst armed conflict in recent years claimed barely a 100 civilian lives. In addition, I consider three major factors in making my forecast. First, the recent ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) which grants more self government amongst islamic citizens in the south is a strong factor to pacify the separatist groups. Second, the martial law extension in the island being approved by the congress and subsequent judicial challenge ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, is widely seen by the citizens of the south positively. Finally, after a generally peaceful midterm elections, the most overwhelming endorsement to Duterte's rule came from the South with an average majority of about 70% and in some key strategic regions reaching as high as 90%, which is unprecedented in our electoral history, tells me that at least for as long as the Duterte government enjoys a very high confidence in the south, chances of conflict outbreaks leading to civilian deaths would be indeed slim."], [14237, "2019-06-24T20:37:00Z", [0.01], ""], [63934, "2019-06-23T15:22:38Z", [0.01], ""], [72785, "2019-06-23T13:50:05Z", [0.01], "Adjusting for elapsed time."], [37597, "2019-06-23T03:00:43Z", [0.05], "Religious conflict or ridding society of 'criminals.'"], [1333, "2019-06-22T09:51:08Z", [0.15], ""], [62808, "2019-06-19T22:26:46Z", [0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-06-16T19:17:53Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2019-06-16T12:31:50Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2019-06-13T18:56:30Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2019-06-13T12:05:16Z", [0.01], ""], [172, "2019-06-12T21:46:56Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2019-06-07T14:07:55Z", [0.01], ""], [36132, "2019-06-03T17:35:10Z", [0.0], ""], [31251, "2019-06-03T15:44:07Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-06-03T11:52:53Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-06-02T12:23:27Z", [0.02], ""], [172, "2019-06-02T12:15:50Z", [0.01], ""], [69257, "2019-06-01T12:45:40Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2019-05-31T18:17:19Z", [0.03], ""], [1333, "2019-05-30T18:49:47Z", [0.04], ""], [70948, "2019-05-30T13:47:03Z", [0.01], ""], [70948, "2019-05-30T07:58:40Z", [0.05], ""], [74166, "2019-05-28T14:02:00Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2019-05-27T11:38:18Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-05-26T22:14:07Z", [0.02], ""], [172, "2019-05-26T16:35:57Z", [0.01], "The people like Duterte.

Inside view: \n- EWP list an ongoing mass killing campaign in the Philippines: \"The government of the Philippines\u2019 state security forces and associated vigilante groups began cracking down on suspected drug users and sellers (along with other suspected political enemies) in a coordinated campaign of mass killing in 2016. In July 2016, the government launched \u201cOperation Double Barrel\u201d to carry out the president\u2019s campaign promise to wipe out all \u201cdrug personalities.\u201d Human rights groups estimate the death toll since President Rodrigo Duterte took office to be well into the thousands.\" [2]\n- There seems to be significant sectarian violence in the country's south, despite a deal giving Muslims autonomy rights. [3] [4] This deal seems to have mainly disarmed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front [5], but not the groups affiliated with Islamic State. However, there seems to have been a strong government response and the US is also involved somehow [6]. I'd very, very surprised if this escalated into a mass killing.\n- I also don't expect the government to engage in another episode of mass killing. Elections are coming up soon and I couldn't find anything on associated violence. This would again be very, very surprising. Overall judgment:\n- EWP seems to be about right here. I'd say 2%.
