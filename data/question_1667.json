Between the 2012 and 2016 presidential races, Trump received only 721 more votes than Romney. Similarly, between the 2014 and 2018 Wisconsin governor races, votes for Walker only ranged by around 40,000. Contrast this to the Democratic turnout: Obama received more than 230,000 more votes in 2012 than Clinton did in 2016; and Evers received around 200,000 more votes in 2018 than Burke did in 2014. This may signal that the Republican turnout is about the same, but that if Biden can get the Democrats to show up for him, he will win Wisconsin. Further, 2016 polls indicated a higher projected turnout for \u201cother,\u201d whereas current polls have \u201cother\u201d at much lower percentages. This may signal that the \u201cother\u201d from 2016 may be leaning Democrat. With current racial tensions going on throughout the state, it may prompt more Democrats in larger cities to turn out.
