For me, one sentence sticks out: \"After the freeing of the sailors, a video showing an American apologizing for entering Iranian waters was released by Iranian state television and threatened to undercut the administration's explanations of the episode and praise for Iranian negotiators.\" So it looks like Iran deliberately released the video after Kerry's conciliatory statement to make the U.S. look foolish and weak. As the CNN story below suggests, this episode may be a manifestation of a power struggle within Iran. OK, maybe, but maybe not. It may be Iranian governmental ministries playing good cop-bad cop, too. I doubt if even the \"experts\" in Washington are of one mind about this. The salient point, in my opinion, is the video shows the sailors kneeling with their hands behind their heads - that is, surrendered. This was not the distress-on-the sea scenario that the U.S. tried to play it off as, and Iran made a point of showing the U.S.' explanation as nonsense.  CNN link: http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/13/politics/iran-sailors-sanctions-obama/ Yesterday, the commander of Iran's armed forces, Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, said that the seizure should be a \"lesson\" to Congress not to reimpose sanctions: http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-seizing-us-sailors-lesson-congress-troublemakers-2016-1 I think this is bigger than some IRGC guys going rogue because they're upset about the nuclear deal; the statement by Firouzabadi indicates that even if Tehran didn't authorize the seizure, it's not going to disassociate itself from it, and will in fact try to exploit it as a threat of future action. And the reason it might work is that, as Iran knows, the U.S. desperately want good relations with Iran, and will make any concession to preserve what the administration considers good relations. This relates to the fate of Rezaian because Iran knows that it can get virtually whatever it wants from the U.S. in exchange for him and the other prisoners it holds. The Iranians held by the U.S. might be included in any deal, but maybe not, because I doubt if the Iranian regime really cares about them. But Rezaian will not be sold cheaply. And that's what he will be - sold back to he U.S. I would imagine that in addition to any concessions the U.S. has to make for his return, it will have to admit that Rezaian was a spy (I'm not saying he was, just that the U.S. will have to say he was), that Iran's arrest, conviction and imprisonment of him was legitimate, and the U.S. will have to apologize to Iran. I'm not saying a deal won't happen, but the incident this week demonstrates that Iran has no fear of U.S. military action, sanctions, or expressions of disappointment. And once sanctions are lifted, they have no reason at all to release Rezaian; both sides have said that the nuclear deal and any potential prisoner swap are unrelated. I don't think Rezaian will be released as a feel-good gesture."], [15312, "2016-01-14T19:04:32Z", [0.8], ""], [484, "2016-01-14T18:08:03Z", [0.5], "Up 5% on @cdob63 point about US sanctions relief possibly easing a trade on the US side."], [15185, "2016-01-14T14:43:38Z", [0.65], ""], [11057, "2016-01-14T05:08:54Z", [0.59], ""], [12874, "2016-01-14T03:38:32Z", [0.42], ""], [12302, "2016-01-14T02:51:32Z", [0.75], ""], [182, "2016-01-14T02:44:20Z", [0.73], "The conciliatory tone of release of US sailors suggests Tehran is purposely softening their tone tone toward the US"], [12302, "2016-01-14T02:08:51Z", [0.7], ""], [73, "2016-01-13T22:34:35Z", [0.49], ""], [691, "2016-01-13T21:41:18Z", [0.72], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-prisoners-insight-idUSKCN0UR01R20160113 Talk of a prisoner swap persists--an inexpensive goodwill chip for both sides.

In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday night, the executives and editors acknowledged the government's past efforts on behalf of Rezaian, who has been detained since July 2014. \"On behalf of our organizations and journalists around the world, we are writing to urge you to maintain your efforts to forge a path to that release,\" they wrote.\nThe letter was signed by Associated Press executive editor Kathleen Carroll, Reuters editor in chief Stephen Adler, CNN president Jeff Zucker, New York Times editor Dean Baquet, and Bloomberg editor John Micklethwait, among others. NBC, ABC, CBS, BuzzFeed, ProPublica, The Los Angeles Times, Politico, PBS \"NewsHour,\" NPR, The New Yorker, and Dallas Morning News were some of the other news organizations represented by the letter. \"We depend on the United States and other democratic countries to stand behind the values that Jason represents,\" the newsroom leaders wrote. \"Independent journalism is recognized as a fundamental human right. Iran should recognize this, too, and free Jason. The United States has considerable leverage with Iran right now to press that point, and we urge you to continue to do so.\" The State Department had no immediate comment, but government spokespeople have repeatedly called for Rezaian's release.

There is no sign Iran\u2019s judiciary, in spite of last summer\u2019s nuclear deal with the West, is softening its stance. If anything, it has been sending strong indications that it will refuse to be influenced by outside pressure.  . . .  [Rezaian's] offenses are thought to carry a maximum jail term of 20 years. \"Having first warned of foreign \u201cinfiltration\u201d in September, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took an even harsher line on Nov. 25.   . . .  a world away from the pragmatism Khamenei showed in agreeing to the nuclear deal just months ago. While the supreme leader seemingly wanted a deal to end sanctions so that Iran could rejoin the global economy, his actions since suggest he doesn\u2019t want to upset loyal elites who have been enriched in the past decade. \" . . . .Rezaian\u2019s imprisonment . . . .. signals not only a split within Iran\u2019s political elite over its future relations with the United States, but also a deeper divide between its politicians and long-suffering people. While the religious power center of the Islamist establishment seems more vehement than ever about the need to protect the principles of the 1979 revolution, many of Iran\u2019s technologically savvy young population shun the mosque and look outward to the West for its entertainment and inspiration.\n. . . \n\"Rouhani and his top officials are caught in the middle between the people and the regime. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif initially said that he hoped Rezaian would be found not guilty but has since backed off that line when questioned about the reporter\u2019s fate, probably sensing the backlash in an increasingly abrasive domestic climate. \u201cThe charges are serious and it\u2019s a judiciary process,\u201d Zarif said on Oct. 17, five days after the Washington Post first reported Rezaian had been convicted. Rouhani, meanwhile, has openly raised the possibility of a prisoner swap, thought to involve at least three Americans, including Rezaian, for 19 Iranians convicted of sanctions offenses in the United States. . . . His remarks, however, were followed by a sharp reminder at how little control he apparently exerts over many of his country\u2019s security institutions. Barely two weeks later, the intelligence section of the Revolutionary Guards arrested an Iranian-American businessman . . .  Adding to Rouhani\u2019s image of powerlessness, Zakka had been invited to Tehran by the government. State television, a fiefdom of hardline conservatives who operate under Khamenei\u2019s authority, later said Zakka was arrested for spying.\n. . . \n\"The latest arrests are another embarrassment for Rouhani who has made a major play for foreign investment to rebuild Iran\u2019s sanctions-ravaged economy. . . .  if the IRGC continue to arrest foreign businessmen, the enthusiasm could quickly disappear. As harsh as Khamenei\u2019s remarks appear, a more optimistic interpretation is that the government is willing to take symbolic actions that signal a staunch anti-American stance \u2014 while in reality having no practical effect. On Nov. 5, for instance, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Trade announced it would ban the import of all American consumer goods. A push \u201cto boost national production\u201d was necessary instead, officials said. The announcement was greeted by laughter among many Iranians. \u201cThey are already here,\u201d Sara Ahmadi, a 30-year-old business executive, said of foreign brands, pointing out that there are three Nike stores on one Tehran street alone. . . . But it\u2019s instructive that those malls were all built by companies linked to the IRGC. . . . .  \"While such contradictions perturb Iran\u2019s rapidly aging clerical leadership, they leave Rezaian and his fellow captives looking like bit part players in a much bigger puzzle. \"The nuclear deal may well have made the diplomatic deals struck in the past considerably more difficult today. In 2010 and 2011, for instance, three American hikers detained by Iran were freed after Oman brokered their release. Then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had ordered them to be freed, only to be temporarily thwarted when the judiciary cancelled their release. \"Iranian authorities, such as the IRGC and the judiciary, seem inclined to play the same game with Rouhani. Even talk of a prisoner exchange in the aftermath of the nuclear deal seems certain to provoke hard-liners dead set against any broader opening toward the United States. \u201cTo the hard-liners that would look like another deal with America, and they don\u2019t want to send that signal,\u201d said a Western diplomat in Tehran. \"The growing list of people languishing in prison, including dozens of Iranian nationals on political charges, continues to dent Rouhani\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d reputation ahead of parliamentary elections in February next year, seen as a crucial test of the president\u2019s clout and his hopes of re-election in 2017. Though most Iranians see the judiciary rather than Rouhani as the culprit, he is a potential fall guy for the frustrated. \u201cThe government has been backed into a corner and, whatever they do, Rouhani and his people face a problem in getting out of this mess that the judiciary has created,\u201d the diplomat said. \"But more hopeful Iranians say Rouhani retains public confidence and shouldn\u2019t buckle in the face of provocations from the most anti-Western elements of the regime. If the hard-liners are routed in the February elections, Rouhani will have a stronger mandate to pursue his agenda. \u201cAhmadinejad and his cronies are not coming back,\u201d a veteran political analyst said. \u201cThe public mood has shifted and this is the hard-liners\u2019 last hurrah. The worst thing Rouhani could do would be to kowtow to them. But for now at least, none of that helps Jason Rezaian.\u201d\n"], [368, "2015-12-14T22:11:24Z", [0.55], ""], [691, "2015-12-14T21:06:02Z", [0.71], ""], [12903, "2015-12-14T16:25:03Z", [0.67], ""], [102, "2015-12-14T04:32:08Z", [0.69], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/excluding-outliers-in-the-smart-crowd-forecast/"], [368, "2015-12-13T22:38:57Z", [0.55], ""], [12879, "2015-12-13T22:36:24Z", [0.99], ""], [12879, "2015-12-13T22:35:05Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2015-12-13T21:48:30Z", [0.71], ""], [1529, "2015-12-13T18:40:00Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2015-12-12T21:36:19Z", [0.75], ""], [136, "2015-12-12T18:11:31Z", [0.66], ""], [691, "2015-12-12T13:09:37Z", [0.72], ""], [102, "2015-12-12T05:10:09Z", [0.58], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/super-friday-night/"], [532, "2015-12-11T23:46:21Z", [0.37], ""], [368, "2015-12-11T22:39:38Z", [0.75], ""], [94, "2015-12-11T21:46:01Z", [0.5], ""], [60, "2015-12-11T21:36:38Z", [0.71], "Lowering to 71% from 80% No news on this IFP (at least that I've seen), but I just wanted to lower this for the next little while.

It pits hard-liners in a secretive deep state\u2014an informal network that includes intelligence officials, judicial officials, influential ideologues, and security forces, such as the Revolutionary Guard\u2014against President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s centrist government, which was popularly elected, in 2013.

Tehran\u2019s deep state increasingly appears intent on sabotaging any openings\u2014in diplomacy, commerce, tourism, and culture\u2014that could compromise its power. Veterans of the \u00e9lite Revolutionary Guard, for example, run many of Iran\u2019s largest companies; they might feel threatened or vulnerable in a more competitive market. \"U.S. officials have taken note of other actions by hard-liners which appear to be conspicuously timed to disrupt the deal. On October 10th, three days before Iran\u2019s parliament voted to formally approve the deal, the Revolutionary Guard test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile that was \u201cinherently capable of delivering a nuclear weapon,\u201d according to Samantha Power, the American Ambassador to the U.N. \u201cThis was a clear violation of U.N.

A day later, Iran\u2019s judiciary announced that the Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian, an American born in California of Iranian descent, had been convicted of treason. \"Hard-line politicians face tough parliamentary elections in February, which could test their influence. In May, the leader of one of the conservative coalitions told me in Tehran that their electoral dominance could slip significantly, by as much as twenty-five per cent. The nuclear deal gave President Rouhani a huge bump in popularity; Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the deal, regularly ranks as the most admired Iranian official in public-opinion polls.\n. . . \n\"In the past four decades, Iran has gone through waves of seizing Americans, beginning with the fifty-two diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in 1979. After four Iranian diplomats disappeared in Lebanon in the early eighties, Iran\u2019s new allies in Hezbollah began nabbing Americans off the streets of Beirut. Dozens were picked up. In the mid-eighties, Iran traded hostages for military equipment, only to pick up more hostages after three were released. One prisoner, Terry Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent, was not released until 1991, after seven years in captivity. During the hard-line rule of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran began arresting Iranian-Americans who came home to visit their families. Some were forced to confess on national television to assorted misdeeds. \"President Rouhani\u2019s inability to prevent the latest detentions or to guarantee the safety of the people he has invited to help Iran open up to new markets has undermined his credibility. At the same time, Tehran claims that at least fourteen Iranians are imprisoned in the United States for sanctions violations. Last month, Rouhani suggested that both governments might intervene on \u201chumanitarian\u201d grounds on behalf of prisoners in either country.

The American side must take its own steps.\u201d His argument is that breaking sanctions is no longer a crime, because now that the world has accepted Iran\u2019s right to a nuclear-energy program many sanctions will be lifted. (Tehran is not pressing for the release of Iranians engaged in other criminal acts.) \"So far, Washington is balking at a swap. \u201cWe continue to call for the immediate release of Saeed Abedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian, and for Iran to work co\u00f6peratively with us to locate Robert Levinson,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cThis should be done independent of any other matter.

Rick Stengel, the undersecretary of state for diplomacy and public affairs,  . .  on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday . . . struggled to explain why the US had been unable to free Rezaian as the result of its diplomatic push with Iran, which culminated in the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on July 14, 2015, about a year after Rezaian was first imprisoned. \"He spent some of the interview explaining why Rezaian\u2019s plight was less important than the overall nuclear issue. He ended up implying that crimes against even American journalists are at best a mid-level priority for US foreign policy . . .  \"Scarborough responded that the administration\u2019s \u201cfirst priority\u201d should have been the release of US citizens held by the regime. . . .  \u201cI would put that to the American people and say, what is your priority? Protecting thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people from a nuclear threat or bringing one journalist home? I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t be arguing for that one journalist, but there was a focus on a nuclear agreement that protects people for generations. I would say that is the highest priority.\u201d \"Stengel identified an unspoken reality underlying all US foreign policy, regardless of who\u2019s in charge or what their worldview may be: Not all goals are of equal importance, and the US\u2019s leverage is never infinite. Given this limited leverage, policy loses all focus unless certain objectives are prioritised ahead of others \u2014 or even sacrificed in favour of goals that are deemed particularly urgent. And in this case, the view was that the fate of one US citizen was less important than nuclear-arms control. \"But Scarborough countered . . . Since the nuclear deal was signed in July, Iran has tested a nuclear-capable ballistic missile in violation of a UN Security Council resolution, freed high-ranking al Qaeda prisoners (including the former interim head of the global terrorism network), arrested American-Iranian businessman Siamak Namazi, and convicted and sentenced Rezaian in a secret court.\nThese developments suggest there\u2019s a powerful hardline faction in Iran that\u2019s capable of pursuing a confrontational policy with the US even in spite of the nuclear deal \u2014 something that itself calls into question whether there\u2019s enough trust between the sides to sustain a complex and non-binding arms-control agreement over the course of several decades. \"Stengel perhaps didn\u2019t intend to do this, but he bluntly illustrated the trade offs in the US\u2019s Iran policy. If you\u2019re going to prioritise arms control above everything else, then it stands to reason that press freedom \u2014 and even the freedom and protection of US citizens \u2014 is secondary to other, supposedly higher concerns. \"Taken one way, Stengel is giving opponents of the US a recipe for getting a relatively free pass on both human rights and the harassment of American citizens. But he\u2019s also admitting that there are unsavoury trade offs at the heart of the Obama administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy accomplishment.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  There is nothing like telling the truth in Washington DC  to get a firestorm going.

(Zoeann Murphy/The Washington Post/File)\nBy Brian Murphy October 23  Follow @BrianFMurphy\nDueling narratives in the Iranian press last week over a jailed Washington Post journalist are bringing into sharper focus the country\u2019s internal political struggles and how they could be playing out as the reporter\u2019s case moves toward sentencing on charges including espionage. The contrasting accounts in rival media \u2014 one conservative and the other reformist \u2014 emerged a week after an Iranian court announced it had convicted Post correspondent Jason Rezaian following a closed-door trial that drew widespread condemnation. Critics including rights activists and press freedom groups as well as United Nations experts and the White House denounced the trial as unfair and the charges as politically motivated. While the opposing Iranian media reports differed over various allegations against the 39-year-old Rezaian \u2014 including a claim that he had insider access to Iran\u2019s reformist government \u2014 the broader implications highlight the long-running ideological clashes within Iran between entrenched hard-line factions and opponents seeking to undercut their influence. [Rezaian verdict decried by family, colleagues] Rezaian\u2019s attorney, his family and The Post strongly denied the charges, saying that all his contacts and work reflected only normal news gathering.

It goes back to the shake-outs after the 1979 Islamic revolution and flared with greater intensity after the election in 1997 of reform-leaning President Mohammad Khatami.

However, even the term \"play ball\" is somewhat of a naive statement as any action taken by Iran is not based upon any type of good-will or progression. This is a childish notion; beyond naive. Iran has only ever made concessions based on ulterior motive. In order to secure sanction relieve it easily manipulated Western powers into a meaningless contract based upon inspection mandates that cannot possibly be successfully implemented. Iran is the brilliant successor to the Nazi regime defined by a cold hard and calculating Machiavellian-Utilitarian philosophy that every action taken, no matter how distasteful Iran finds it, is merely means to an end. Surprising this end is quite radical, and publicly espoused by every sector of Iranian society, from the peasants to the Ayatollah. They demand an end to Western dominance, Christianity, Judaism, and of course the destruction of the United States and Israel. The only comical element to all of this is how blatantly obvious it is, and Iran's resolve not to hide it. They basically say: \"Yeah, we lied about all that. Thanks for the money bitches. Death to the West. Iran out\".\nThe idealist would advocate nothing more than the pathetic notion that one can secularize a *hithole like Iran. It can't be done. Sadam did a fantastic job as a balance of power, until foreign intervention and Bush policy eradicated all hope of stability in the Middle East. The fact of the matter is, as grotesque a premise as it is, the Middle East will only cease to cause problems if (like the British Empire) we employ the very same means-to-ends resolution. Brutal, powerful, bad-to-the-bone dictators like Assad that the West can buy off. Some would argue that the citizenry wants freedom. I would counter with \"people in hell want ice water\". Too damn bad. Not only do people so manipulated and per-versed by something as primitive as Islam not deserve freedom, they are not intellectually capable of understanding the basic concept. Their standard of life is not relevant to me, not in the slightest, my children's is. That's where my priorities lie and that's where yours should as well. The U.S. attempted an experiment, an experiment that already failed the Soviets. The difference is that the Russians learned from their mistakes, and are equipped to handle the Middle East. They understand what Western classical liberalism refuses to accept. That tolerance is not an absolute, and was never intended to function as such. Tolerance rather, is totally relative based upon the crucial element of reciprocation. Tolerance only functions when the majority and minority reciprocate a mutual respect.  When they are crushed so far beneath our feet that they lament every aspect of their lives, that's only half-good enough. If we want to fix the Middle East we have to break them. Deprive them of even the simplest pleasures. Why? Well in order to shut them up so we can go on pretending they don't exist again like the good old days, and of course perfectly justified spiteful retribution for their unforgivable crime of existence. A thorn in the side of the Western world since the crusades. It sounds harsh, I'm aware, but the pragmatist accepts the half-empty glass instead of attempting to fill it with his own tears. \nThat's it for my tangent. What was the question?

For the rest, a Presidential pardon would be the simplest way to proceed.   My latest theory is this:  Obama agrees to a swap after the Presidential election.   By waiting, he keeps it from being a campaign issue that may hurt the Democratic nominee.  He will be on his way out so he will not care about how much the Republicans scream and yell about it.

[Khamenei's] outright ban on future negotiations with the US also promises to damage apparent Western optimism about broad-based rapprochement. These hopes had already been complicated by Khamenei\u2019s previous, slightly more measured statements, as well as by similarly aggressive commentary from President Hassan Rouhani, who has nonetheless used some public statements to suggest moderate improvements in relations between the two countries. Last week, Rouhani appeared to straddle both sides of his inconsistent statements about the West when he suggested that the US might be able to negotiate for the release of three Americans held prisoner in Iran, but insisted that the US first release 19 Iranian citizens imprisoned in the US for sanctions violations. Although such an offer arguably favors Iran from the very outset, Khamenei\u2019s superior authority means that these negotiations are no longer a possibility in light of the supreme leader\u2019s edict.\n. . . \n\". . .  The targeting of Rezaian has been variously interpreted by international observers as a means of securing leverage over the US, as a means of compensating for the perceived Iranian concessions on its nuclear program, and as part of a broad-ranging crackdown on the media at a time when there is much talk of improved relations with the West. \"Whatever the motivations behind the arrest, Khamenei\u2019s remarks have presumably closed off any negotiations that were already ongoing about Rezaian, for whom the Obama administration repeatedly claimed to be attempting to secure release, along with former US Marine Amir Hekmati and Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini. \". . . He reportedly faces 10 to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. Abedini is serving an eight year sentence for practicing his faith and Hekmati is serving 12, also for spying. \"Many rights groups and news analysts now expect that Rezaian will be convicted, although Iranian law specifies that his verdict and sentence should have been handed down weeks ago, after the last session of his closed-door trial.  \"The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said this week that it is increasingly clear that Rezaian will be convicted solely on the basis of a forced confession, which may have been obtained under threat of torture, and certainly under the stresses of relentless interrogations and months-long periods of solitary confinement. . . . \"Nonetheless, somewhat more specific allegations were levied against the American-Iranian journalist this week, with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps saying that he had worked on behalf of the US government to establish an extensive spy network with the goal of toppling the clerical regime. His family and colleagues have rejected the notion that he could have been a spy, and they have observed that the Iranian judiciary has apparently chosen to criminalize his mere conversations with acquaintances about Iranian affairs. \"It is highly possible that some of these acquaintances are considered enemies of the Iranian regime on the basis of similarly vague accusations. There is no indication that Rezaian sought or obtained sensitive information, but the Iranian regime is known to convict political prisoners on the basis of guilt-by-association, for instance executing Gholamreza Khosravi last year on charges stemming only from his having donated money to a satellite television network affiliated with the opposition People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran.\n~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Groan.

He then sketched the outline of a trade.   The speaker does not have direct authority over Rezaian, but he's close to those who do: His brother is the head of Iran's judiciary.  Larijani's suggestion appears to be the most direct public consideration of a trade by an Iranian official.  Larijani is a veteran of complicated international issues, having served as the head of Iran's nuclear negotiating team a decade ago.\n\nQuestion: There was an occasion recently with Cuba where the United States exchanged prisoners with Cuba. Is that what you're suggesting?\nLarijani: That's one way. There are other ways that the judiciary systems of the two countries can come up with. It is the judiciary that has to decide about it. The Iranian speaker's remarks contrast sharply with a recent statement by  Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hassan Qashqavi, who stated, \"An exchange of Jason Rezaian is not on the agenda.\"  That comment  was seen as noteworthy partly because it was \"the first time a high-level official has alluded to the possibility of such a trade.  Even as he rejected the idea of a prisoner swap, Qashqavi also noted that the U.S. is currently holding 19 \"innocent people under sanctions charges\" \u2014 and that Iran wants them freed.  Last month, news emerged that a verdict had been reached in his case, but it has not been announced. In addition to Rezaian, Iran has been holding three other Americans \u2014 former Marine Amir Hekmati; pastor Saeed Abedini; and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson \u2014 for several years. ~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  From the get-go, Larijani has always been far more optimistic about Rezaian's release than any other Iranian, but this question won't  close for about a year.. . .plenty of time to work out a swap.  I'm not sure what the significance of Rezaian's verdict & sentence not having been announced is:  are moderate Iranians trying to keep a very harsh judgment under wraps so that it would be easier to negotiate a swap & let him go?   When the nuclear deal is inked and the sanctions lifted, perhaps conservative Iranians will relax and allow a swap.  I'm going to make my forecast more optimistic.
