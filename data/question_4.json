Along the lines we've been discussing, the IPO process ends, from reading this document, at the \"listing\" stage. This reminds me now of the impeachment procedure discussion lol! The impeachment procedure subsumes impeachment. The IPO process subsumes IPOs. LOL. The procedure/process and the underlying event are not the same. It's like saying the birthing process is not complete until a birth certificate is issued. Tell that to the parents and baby. No, that's not quite right. Rather, it's like saying the birth has not occurred until the birth certificate is obtained.\nhttp://www.legalink.ch/Root/Sites/legalink/Resources/Questionnaires/IPOs/Asia/Legalink%20IPO_China.pdf Here's a decent perspective, which sounds more accurate to me: \"Once the issuer completes the offering of shares, it may apply to the stock exchange for the listing of new shares.\" Now that's right. The offering and listing are independent.\n(From: Chinese Capital Market Takeover and Restructuring Guide  By Chengwei Liu - page 336)\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=N8Gf_bdA0zcC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=shenzhen+ipo+subscription+listing&source=bl&ots=sgEoYuq7Ps&sig=N8SvInQsRAuCpbr3f6Tk3iuO1IU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjYvITowMHJAhUGQCYKHVGjCsIQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=shenzhen%20ipo%20subscription%20listing&f=false\nEven in this book, though, the author conflates the \"procedures of offering\" (e.g., refunds of excess subscription fees, etc.) with the offering itself, to arrive at a \"completed offering.\" So, in any case, it's not the listing stage that is holding this Q up; or it shouldn't be. Which returns us to the notion that a company that experiences a suspended. withdrawn, or reversed IPO (after a definite announcement of a subscription offer) cannot ever have another \"IPO.\" Hmm. I passed a quick evaluation of that already, but I'll think this over some more later. Is it more like lost-virginity, or re-doing third down after a penalty?
