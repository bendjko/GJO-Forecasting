Even with that as the best case it's below 19M in only 8% of cases, and I'd put a sudden decline at 50/50 at best, so 96% based on that. I'd adjust to 97% to account for the fact that there's a few sharp drops over holiday weekends that can get included in the projection without necessarily including their corresponding jump about a week later as delayed tests get done.  I do adjust back down though, I think there is some chance of a sustained drop, we are at a higher level than the history I'm using so there is more room for it to fall. In that vein, I may also be wrong about using raw instead of percentage changes. The Monte Carlo using percentage changes gives <19M  in the best case scenario a probability of 31%, so then my prediction would thus be ~87%, so I adjust down a bit for that too.

We need below 23,734 to stay below 17.5M and daily average of 44,901 will get us to 19.0M cases in the next 71 days. To add some perspective, I ran the two-week average all the way back to December 2020. The last time Brazil had under 44,901 14-day average new cases was back on 1/12/21. That means that we've had sustained levels above the required daily rate for over 4 months with 2.33 months left. Also worth keeping in mind that the AVERAGE of the next 71 days has to be below 44,901 which means they'd not only need to reverse course, but do so to an extent that offsets any days that were above this average. Current 14-day average is 62,990 and 7-day is 64,665 so we are over 40% above required threshold and that is quickly eating into any hope that the average can be below 44,901. As sad as it is to say, it seems like Brazil has made a choice at this point and I think the only way they'd be able to do anything about their numbers would be drastic intervention. The likelihood of that is quite low, but there is still a chance they can keep things below 19.0M. FORECAST - When I look at this in another 3 weeks, I hope we will be somewhere around 16.8M cases and that will put us at needing 13,726 cases to hit 17.5M and 43,137 to hit 19.0M. Deviations from this should be considered when making my prediction at that time. The true expectation is above that because it only takes 47,045 cases per day to get to my 16.8M number. If current numbers hold steady, with a slight discount because we may be at a peak, we are expecting closer to 17.03M cases which leads to needing only 39,215 average for the remaining 50 days in order to see 19.0M."], [87827, "2021-05-21T13:58:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.25, 0.74], "71 days left, currently at 64k cases a day, need to average under 24k to be under 17.5 and under 45k to stay under 19 million.

It's now going on long enough that it seems to me that the current decline is likely not just \"noise\" on the way up. However, I still firmly believe that Brazil will see >19.0M cases by July 31 because the peak respiratory virus season is approximately from now through the end of July, there is no concerted national effort to stem transmission, and vaccination is proceeding slowly and primarily with a vaccine that has been found to be 50% effective at preventing cases in Brazil. It is as inconceivable to me that there will not be a winter peak in cases of a respiratory virus in Brazil as it was that the US would not see an increase in cases last fall and winter. Spreading in fall, winter and spring is what respiratory viruses do. Even if cases continue to decline a bit more, I am confident that they will be heading back up within the forecast period. There are 4.22M cases to go to reach 19.0M, and 89 days remaining in the forecast period; it will take an average of 47.4k cases/day to reach 19M, and Brazil is currently at a 7-day average of 58.6k cases/day.

Total cases required to hit 17.5M are 3,058,437 and 19M are 4,558,437. We have 93 days of reporting remaining before the numbers are finalized. As of today, the daily case rates required for 17.5M and 19M are 32,886 and 49,015 respectively. These requirements are down from 40,368 and 52,563 cases per day as of March 30 because Brazil had sustained high daily numbers throughout April. The last time Brazil's 7-day average was below 49,015 was 2/25/21 and the last time it was below 32,886 was before December of last year. So below 17.5M is a real long shot. Checking past 93 days of infections shows 5.596M total new cases and the lowest 7-day average has been is 44,267 on 2/16/21. If the back half of this surge looks like the front half in terms of speed and \"normal\" case rate levels for Brazil, then I'm expecting around 4.3M total cases in the remaining time frame. Current factors to consider are vaccination/immunization rates of the population. This will change both the potentially infected and the carrier numbers - as fewer people carry high viral loads and more peoples immune systems handle minor infections we will probably see fewer positive tests. People who have already had it are also less likely to get tested again. If new variants emerge that can re-infect already infected persons, then that has a potential to cause another spike in cases. This would increase the chances that we see the 4.5M cases required to hit 19M. Doubtful that COVID can continue to mutate so quickly that it continues to evade immune systems that have seen other variants already. Not an immunologist, but if your body has fought 2-3 strains of the disease there are definitely fewer mutations that could get past you and require you to get tested. I'm thinking the \"normal\" rate for infections is somewhere around 30,000 daily. Predict we will see Brazil approach this limit again and likely rebound upward as people begin to feel more comfortable living their lives normally.

Initial: \n~1.1M / month considering 13M cases since Apr 3 2020 would yield abt 17M cases by end of July. Restraining to Oct 3 yields about 1.3M/mo, and already considers a post-restrictions period in october (8M cases / 6mo). Initial guess be something in 17.4 - 18.3M. Considering the ratio observed in the past 3 months, yield an upper limit of 20. [1] 1. Restrictions:\nState governments have rolled out multiple restrictions over the past month or so. The impact of these has been questionable in Brazil (as the possible answers indicate). My prior for these is that circulation and commerce restrictions tend to drive new case numbers down a few weeks after the start of restrictions.\nTaking the reduction in September (25%), October (50%) as best case scenarios for 1, 2 months after restrictions, we could go from ~70k daily cases to 52-35k cases/day. The \"isolation indices\" published by Sao Paulo [2] support a similar level of isolation in March 2021 compared to August 2020. Sao Paulo seems to be an OK proxy for self-isolation in most other states [3]. After these initial successes, restrictions will most likely be lifted (as happened in all states last year). This could mean that cases creep up again the following month, or maybe vaccines play a significant enough role in reducing contagion. 1.i) Jan - Mar as guess for April 2021\nWorst-case initial guesses (1.75M / month, ~58k daily cases) could be updated to 44-29k cases in the coming months of May, June. We could take this to mean daily increases of 58k, 44k, 29k in April, May, June. I'll defer analysing the vaccine impact and place July between 20 (1/3 reduction) and 44k daily cases.\nThis takes us to 4.65M - 5.425M new cases in the coming months => 17.65 - 18.425M. 1.ii) March 2021 as the ratio for April 2021\nStarting from March 2021 as the guess for april leads to a significantly worse outcome: (~65k, 49, 32.5, 22-49) => 5.22 - 6.06 => 18.22M - 19.06M 2. Temporary wrap-up\nI'll temporarily settle for the middle ground between (1.i), (1.ii), with a bit more weight (2:1) towards (1.i), as March of 2021 was an extreme month, most likely due to Carnival etc. This yields 17.84 - 18.63, which falls entirely  in the 3rd option. I'll remove some of that certainty by considering that I was pretty generous in the atenuation effect of restriction measures. Also, vaccination (or highiers compliance to isolation) could drive new case rates down faster. Going with (0, 5, 60, 35).

Using the average number of daily infections and assuming linear growth of .79% daily we are far surpassing 19M and we wind up around 176,000 infections per day by the time July 31 is here - total infected approximately 27.7M. Daily infection rate to reach 19M infections in the remaining 123 days until July 31 needs to be an AVERAGE of 52,563 new cases per day.  Average daily numbers for other values are:\n40,368 to hit 17.5M\n28,173 to hit 16M\n15,978 to hit 14.5M Last time the rolling 30-day average dropped below the 28,173 was 12/3/20. From a real-world perspective it is an impossibility that they are able to be below 16M without very drastic measures that have so far not materialized. From a reporting perspective, Brazil could report fewer cases than they actually have or they could limit or stop testing entirely which would skew the numbers. Have to leave at least a percentage around in the case that Brazil changes things completely. Now, we need to figure out which milestones they will hit. Cases are rising currently and 30-day rolling average is now at 69,301 with the 7-day average at 76,636. The last time the 7-day average was below the 40,368 was back on 1/8/20 and the 30-day is essentially at the same point.

If we want to unwind the same pattern for the full 123 days we get to 6,368,082 cases in that timeframe which would net 18,902,770 cases in total. So now that we have some sort of framework to mathematically understand this (yes, it could be a more complex model but I'm not exactly a whiz at modeling) we need to understand the likelihood that Brazil's numbers from tomorrow through 7/31 will be an exact reversal of the previous 123 days.

The most reasonable path to get below is non-parabolic, with a peak around 80,000 in the next couple weeks, and a sharp fall to 20,000-30,000 per day by late June after which the sharp fall slows. That optimistic path (arbitrarily calculated fitting a polynomial line to some points in Excel) puts you at 46k per day average.  Picking a path relies on the details of Brazil\u2019s COVID efforts. Brazil's track record is... poor for COVID, and going by Bolsonaro's recent speech it doesn't look like there will be centralized effort to change that any time soon. They're yet to start manufacturing the AstraZeneca vaccine as they'd planned and are instead importing the SinoVac one. Unfortunately the overall poor response hasn't gone on long enough to get them close to herd immunity, their cases are about 6% of the population so far, and that's roughly consistent in the states of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. Even with a markup for undiagnosed cases of like 5x that's still not close. That\u2019s also not to mention the new variant that\u2019s arisen in Brazil, which is most likely more contagious than the older one.  The vaccine rollout will be interesting, since it seems they plan to rely on SinoVac and AstraZeneca. SinoVac only had 50% efficacy in preventing COVID in Brazilian trials, but 78% efficacy against \"mild-severe\" cases. Even if it doesn't prevent many COVID infections and or spread, widespread vaccination will likely decrease reported cases by preventing symptomatic ones that lead to testing.  It\u2019s difficult to isolate the effect of vaccines on cases though in other countries. Other countries have been able to achieve sharp drops concurrent with vaccine distribution, such as the US and UK, however, the UK did it while reaching ~40% of the population with at least one vaccine dose as of today, and the US ~26%, on top of lockdown measures after winter spikes in both cases, as well as warmer weather that likely led to people spending less time indoors.  On the other hand, France and Italy have been rolling out vaccines as well but cases have been slowly rising for months, and their large spike was before the winter. Both Italy and France\u2019s vaccine rollouts have been somewhat slower, reaching about 10% of the population with one dose by now. Canada had the same winter spike as the US, but its vaccine rollout has been much slower, getting to <10% of the population. It still had the sharp drop after the winter despite lack of vaccination, but cases have been going up recently while the US has been flat or declining. The cases of Canada vs the US and France/Italy vs the UK makes me question how good of a model I really have for predicting the effects of different country-specific factors on cases. I think it\u2019s safe to say that vaccines aren\u2019t really a significant factor in case counts (they are in death counts though) until they reach huge chunks of the population, like maybe 20% or more, and even then, it\u2019s still not clear. Brazil has only reached about 6%, so even if they are able to ramp up in the coming months they\u2019ve got a lot of ground to cover.  Overall, it\u2019s possible for Brazil to get below 19M if their new cases peak in the next couple weeks and fall quickly from there. Whether that\u2019ll happen is the big question. The negative argument is that they probably don\u2019t have vaccines working in their favor yet, cases are still trending up and COVID trends take a while to change direction, and the federal administration doesn\u2019t seem like it has much intention of improving its response. On the other hand, some governors are stepping up to get vaccines and push for lockdowns, but most importantly to me, the model that I have of explaining country-by-country results using vaccines and lockdowns and weather doesn\u2019t yield very good predictions for the countries I mentioned before. Absent good explanations of how countries fare with COVID, I lean on Brazil\u2019s track record, which is unequivocally bad. In the GJP2.0 pessimism around Brazil was heavily rewarded. Maybe it\u2019ll be mostly due to variants, maybe lack of government response, maybe something else, maybe a mix, but if the past is any indication, it won\u2019t look good.

It's about as perfect a line as you can get, showing exponential growth. Of course, past exponential growth doesn't mean exponential growth will continue, but I don't see much to slow it down substantially in the near term.\nEven if growth is linear, at 2M cases/month, Brazil will get to over 19.0 million by July 31. And growth is exponential, not linear, heading into fall and winter. Update 5/1: Forecast still holding. With exponential growth, noise also grows in amplitude. In other words, the ups and downs in cases/day get bigger, too. I see the recent trend downwards as in the noise, i.e., just bumps along the way up; indeed, cases are going back up again. 14.66M cases as of 4/30. 4.34M to go to 19M, or 47.2k/day. 68k cases today; 60.3k/day 7-day average and climbing. If cases/day remained flat at 60k for all of May (and I think they'll go up), then by the end of May, there will be 2.48M cases left to go to reach 19M, or 40.7k/day.  Some think vaccination will make a big difference. I agree it will make some difference. But if they give ~1M doses/day, there will still be an awful lot of susceptible people around by the end of July. As of today, only 6.3% of the country is fully vaccinated; 13.6% has had at least one dose. In all of April, they added only 4.2% of the population (8.9M) to the fully vaccinated category. If they give 1M doses/day, then by July 31, 13.6% + (~2/3 * 93 days * 1M doses/day) / 211M people *100% = 13.6% + 29.4% = 43% will be fully vaccinated, still below the herd immunity threshold even if you say that half of the nonvaccinated remainder of the population is already immune because they will have been infected with SARSCoV2. But honestly, will that many people be vaccinated by then? We're hitting vaccine hesitancy in the US at 30% of the population having received at least one dose. On the other hand, cases are declining here in the US because of a combination of seasonality, vaccination and natural immunity, and behavior, and so people aren't worrying as much. All in all, of course, the more people you remove from the susceptible pool by vaccination, the less the virus can spread, but I don't expect vaccination to make that big of a dent on *infections* for a while. Also, with July in the Southern Hemisphere being equivalent to January in the Northern Hemisphere in terms of seasonality, Brazil still has a long way to go with fall and winter case growth; cases/day grew throughout the fall and early winter until they peaked in the US in early January. Seasonality is weaker in Brazil, but nonetheless, I can't help but think we'll see at least a somewhat similar pattern in Brazil. In short, with Bolsonaro (i.e., no federal leadership favoring containment policies) + winter + slow vaccination, I don't see how cases can be under 19M by the end of July. I think cases should definitely be on the wane by sometime in July and perhaps slightly earlier, if Brazil can ramp up vaccination, but I don't think we're going to see 7-day average case numbers in the 40k's for a while."], [36738, "2021-03-25T14:41:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6], "Pulled the last 4 Weekly totals of New Daily Cases, and averaged for daily. \nweek of 2/22   373.9/7 = 53.4MM\nweek of 3/1.    413.6/7 = 59MM\nweek of 3/8     494.2/7 = 70.6MM\nweek of 3/15   508.010/7 = 72, 572.9571.

Current 7 day rolling average is 70,000 per day. Have to average less than 23k daily cases to stay below 14.5 million. Negligible chance that happens, the lowest it's been since the start of the pandemic is around 20k cases per day. Have to average less than 34k cases per day to stay below 16 million. Very little chance of that as it looks like most of the country likely won't be vaccinated by the end of summer. Have to average less than 44.4k cases per day to stay below 17.5 million. This is fairly plausible as they averaged roughly around there before the recent spike and they do appear to have some vaccinations happening. Less than 55k cases per day to stay below 19 million. This seems pretty likely as levels have been below that for most of the pandemic. But there's a decent chance that the recent spike lasts long enough to make staying under 19 million difficult.
