Also, Senator Roberts of Kansas is more focused on increasing US exports of agricultural products to Mexico, something that might be threatened by a US withdrawal. https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/03/23/us/politics/23reuters-usa-trump-trade.html"], [18356, "2017-03-24T08:01:59Z", [0.05], ""], [34507, "2017-03-24T01:52:28Z", [0.05], ""], [15680, "2017-03-23T16:55:17Z", [0.01], ""], [16518, "2017-03-23T16:29:23Z", [0.05], ""], [16518, "2017-03-23T16:26:46Z", [0.3], "Comment deleted on Mar 23, 2017 04:29PM UTC"], [368, "2017-03-23T15:37:05Z", [0.0], ""], [4645, "2017-03-23T14:59:51Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2017-03-23T14:59:47Z", [0.01], ""], [32785, "2017-03-23T14:55:58Z", [0.11], ""], [331, "2017-03-23T13:28:13Z", [0.02], ""], [35, "2017-03-23T10:52:47Z", [0.03], ""], [24401, "2017-03-23T10:17:15Z", [0.05], "Revising down based on limited time left and endless other issues."], [32539, "2017-03-22T22:54:09Z", [0.12], ""], [16284, "2017-03-22T21:17:45Z", [0.05], ""], [34221, "2017-03-22T21:07:42Z", [0.0], ""], [25428, "2017-03-22T20:59:15Z", [0.0], ""], [26719, "2017-03-22T17:56:01Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-03-22T16:28:05Z", [0.0], ""], [34310, "2017-03-22T15:43:10Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2017-03-22T15:09:13Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2017-03-22T12:30:49Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-03-22T03:09:30Z", [0.0], ""], [23788, "2017-03-21T21:47:06Z", [0.02], ""], [34472, "2017-03-21T15:45:39Z", [0.01], ""], [4645, "2017-03-21T14:40:41Z", [0.01], ""], [34471, "2017-03-21T14:11:32Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-03-20T15:47:28Z", [0.0], ""], [31450, "2017-03-20T15:41:30Z", [0.03], "Dropping five points because I think NAFTA is a second tier priority for the administration.

But if he wants to change NAFTA substantively on issues like labor regulations, then the legislative branch will most likely have to be involved. \u201cIf a newly renegotiated NAFTA meant that the US was taking on more obligation, that we had to change our laws and regulations to be in conformity with it, then Congress would have to pass that,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank that is generally pro\u2013free trade. \"The working assumption among trade analysts is that Trump has some latitude to renegotiate NAFTA using his existing trade promotion authority \u2014 a policy that lets the White House negotiate trade agreements and submit them to Congress for a simple up-or-down vote \u2014 granted to the president by Congress under the Obama administration. That power lasts until 2018, and can be extended by Congress until 2021. If that analysis is correct, Trump could submit a renegotiated NAFTA to Congress, which would then vote either yes or no on it \u2014 without the ability to offer any changes to the deal at all. \" . . .  nobody knows how Trump actually wants to change free trade in North America. \"Trade experts are entirely unclear on what course of action Trump is actually likely to pursue at the negotiating table. And lack of clarity regarding his goals is compounded by the fact that two out of three of his major trade picks for his administration don\u2019t have experience forging trade agreements. \"Tariffs: Trump may try to create exceptions to the NAFTA norm of zero tariffs, according to some trade analysts. He could do something like argue for the countries to be able to use tariffs on certain goods like textiles or automobiles. Trump\u2019s hope would be that the increased cost of them coming across the border would make domestic production of those goods more competitive, and boost domestic production as a result. But Trump will have an extremely difficult time getting Canada or Mexico to agree to raising tariffs. \"Rules of origin: Another major point that could be up for negotiation could be the wonkily named \u201crules of origin,\u201d or the percentage of a finished product that must be made in North America in order to be considered eligible for the NAFTA free trade treatment. \"Labor and environmental standards: The Trump administration could also discuss raising labor and environmental standards under NAFTA in a bid to make American workers more competitive. By demanding more stringent standards and enforcement of standards regarding issues like minimum wages, union organizing rights, workplace safety, and environmental impact, the cost of doing business in Mexico will go up, and blunt some of the edge that lower-paid Mexican workers have over more expensive US workers. Would Mexico agree to these regulations that could eat away at the bottom line of its businesses? \u201cIt\u2019s really likely they would do it \u2014 given that they just agreed to do it on the TPP,\u201d Bown said. \"Both the US and Mexican governments have threatened to pull out NAFTA if they can\u2019t find common ground during renegotiation \u2014 something that either country can do unilaterally under Article 2205 of NAFTA."], [368, "2017-02-10T21:15:19Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-02-10T18:39:39Z", [0.1], ""], [32056, "2017-02-10T12:53:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-02-10T02:58:49Z", [0.1], ""], [33577, "2017-02-10T00:48:13Z", [0.4], ""], [1333, "2017-02-09T21:41:16Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2017-02-09T21:07:42Z", [0.05], ""], [29587, "2017-02-09T19:57:23Z", [0.2], ""], [13824, "2017-02-09T19:56:05Z", [0.1], ""], [15414, "2017-02-09T19:00:35Z", [0.75], ""], [33566, "2017-02-09T18:08:31Z", [0.75], "Trump appears to be committed to his campaign promises and this was a high priority.

With regards to NAFTA, an older source from November 2016 [3] suggests that Trump would begin negotiations within 100 days and consider a formal withdrawal by 200 days if negotiations didn't lead anywhere, this places a potential notice of intent in early Aug 2017, well outside the time frame. However in the months since then there have been a number of decisive actions by Trump and talks have begun to break down with the Mexican president - this might make negotiation impossible and trigger an early notice of intent. Don't have a feel for how this increases the chance, so base rate doubled arbitrarily, think the time frame is still too short.

Interestingly, a few nights ago I heard a news commentator say that having Mexico pay for the wall was not his initial plan. Apparently his initial plan was to tax the remittances sent by workers in the U.S. to their families back home in Mexico (and presumably Honduras, etc.). I'm not sure how he got from the initial funding idea to having the Mexican government pay for it, but while it would likely be impossible to enforce (money being fungible and how the heck could you track that flow?), taxing remittances seems to have at least some relevance to the economic aspect of illegal immigration. Populist economics is Trump's strong suit, but beside changing funding of the wall, he has now recast the wall less as an economic issue and more as a public safety issue.

Loss of independence is not necessarily a negative when it is replaced by a system of interdependence. Leaders have collaborated on everything from terrorism after 2001 to cooperation on regional infrastructure such as the proposed NAFTA superhighway running from Canada to Mexico.

This gives a long lead time to attempt to start negotiations, have negotiations and then either fail or succeed. Success could be measured by an infinite spectrum... but that is getting too far ahead. This goal to reopen negotiations is unlikely to be completely rebuffed by Canada and Mexico in the first 100 days, therefore my prediction is leaning toward not happening based on the short time period. Many people comment that President-Elect Trump either doesn't believe what he is saying or that he doesn't know what he is doing and that his policy statements cannot be trusted to any degree for a measurement of future activity. I find it difficult to confirm this either way but certainly leave it open to discuss proof that he will act in a particular manner. But from the 'Art of the Deal' one is left with the impression that he simply wants to make a deal and look good in having done so, even if the outcome is not as good as he makes it sound to be. Therefore, I assess it likely that a new agreement with the NAFTA partners, no matter how small a revision, will be celebrated as a President Trump success. The logical conclusion to this is he will try very hard to open negotiations and therefore be unlikely to give notification to withdraw in the first 100 days. A return to protectionism has precedence in the modern era [2], so it is not unheard of to remove 'free-trade agreements'... This leaves me open minded on the possibility that it can happen.

He has announced intent to renegotiate or provide notice in the first 100 days: http://www.kiro7.com/news/trending-now/obamacare-immigration-canceled-executive-orders-what-donald-trump-says-he-will-do-the-first-100_/481233001"], [424, "2017-01-05T05:03:21Z", [0.65], "Lobbyist may derail it..."], [31101, "2017-01-05T03:03:09Z", [0.02], ""], [27226, "2017-01-05T02:20:42Z", [0.05], "View it more likely the trump administration will look to amend rather than withdraw outright."], [915, "2017-01-05T02:14:14Z", [0.0], "trump can probably get nearly everything he wants in the short-term w/the mere threat of withdrawal."], [32133, "2017-01-05T02:02:51Z", [0.01], "too disruptive to scrap it entirely and timeframe is short."], [4423, "2017-01-05T00:34:45Z", [0.6], "Key words--notice of intent."], [23006, "2017-01-04T23:12:21Z", [0.0], "Renegotiating first, then if not acceptable he would formally withdraw - this could take months so question deadline is unlikely."], [32127, "2017-01-04T22:30:28Z", [0.07], "Seems unlikely, but pretty great uncertainty in what agenda will be"], [32125, "2017-01-04T21:58:24Z", [0.01], ""], [32120, "2017-01-04T21:54:05Z", [0.03], ""], [15097, "2017-01-04T19:57:20Z", [0.09], ""], [175, "2017-01-04T19:33:41Z", [0.1], ""], [22245, "2017-01-04T19:24:54Z", [0.05], "I don't think there will be a withdrawal, but there will be a renegotiation of NAFTA."], [2895, "2017-01-04T19:24:03Z", [0.07], "Withdraw and then replace at some indefinite time would objectively cause profound disruptions in production, supply chains, goods inventory  and border access to thousands of enterprises and millions of consumers.

I guess Trump would need to give then a few weeks to think about it. If they agree then months or years of negotiations would follow so the answer to this question with 0%. If  they say no then step 2 could be threatening to give notice, they would need to be given time to think about it. If they now agree to negotiate the answer to the question is 0%. If they still don't agree then notice could be given. \nSo the issues are (a) will Canada and Mexico agree to negotiate (b) if they don't will Trump write the letter  and does he need Congress to agree (c) if it comes to triggering the latter how long will it all take. \nIf I was involved on the Mexican or Canadian side I would be seriously worried about the US withdrawing from NAFTA. Faced with the threat of the US withdrawing I would aim to prevaricate. The NAFTA agreement appears to be a fairly complex trade agreement with lots of sections covering issues that could be regarded as favorable to US interests as well as things that are favorable to Mexican or Canadian interests.  If  negotiations are started no doubt all three countries will press for more favorable terms for their special interests, so renegotiation could quite easily be dragged out for years as all the special interest groups weigh in with demands that they want their governments to fight for. Unilaterally withdrawing would harm all three countries and cross border businesses. Trump might threaten to rip up the deal. but my guess is that it would be big risk to US business. \nSo my conclusion is that before 30th April 2017 Canada and Mexico will agree to talk about re-negotiating NAFTA. As its unclear if Trump has the power to trigger article 2205 and (to me) its unclear if he writes the letter if he can withdraw it within the 6 months, it therefore seems unlikely that it the letter will be sent before 30th April.  \nSome numbers; agree to negotiate with no specific threats before  30th April 80%, Not agree to negotiate and are threatened with 2205 20%, agree to negotiate under threat of 2205  20%. I don't see it in anyone's interest to push it over the cliff. \nI will admit I have been wrong about Trump before.

One is to withdraw from it; the other is to take some other action on trade (such as a general tariff) that would address the same political need to do something.
