Although the opportunity has now arisen, it would make more sense for China to put the GCC ahead of a potential TPP partnership as China already has FTA\u2019s with 5 out of the 12 TPP member countries and has negotiations under way for a Japan-Korea FTA (Japan is a TPP member).

But there are several political issues that could affect the relations between the GCC member states and China, with the US at the base of them: It was announced today that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for head of the White House National Trade Council is the economist Peter Navarro - a fierce critic of China. Having written books on China\u2019s economy, such as \u2018Death by China\u2019 and \u2018The Coming China Wars\u201d, it looks like US-China relations are in for a turbulent year. This would be a driving factor for China to speed up agreeing to an FTA with the GCC. \nTrump has also added to the increasing tensions with China by continuing to go ahead with the US visit from the Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-Wen. An event that \u201cChina has reportedly tried to block in the wake of a row over perceived Pro-Taiwan comments by Donald Trump\u201d (theguardian.com) Trump\u2019s incoming presidency is favourable to the GCC, this can be seen by the President-elects top job picks showing a desire to improve the relationship between the US and GCC member states. The US works closely with Arab partners on areas such as counter-terrorism, intelligence sharing and the war on Syria - it has also been reported that Saudi Arabia provides bases for US drone flights. (cnnpolitics.com). The appointment of Rex Tillerson, as Secretary of State, who \u2018has praised Qatar as \u201csuccessful\u201d and \u201ccommitted\u201d to its people and has spoken of cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the UAE\u2019 (middleeasteye.net), sends a positive message to the oil rich GCC member states about the oil industry and global markets. However, Trump\u2019s appointment of David Friedman as US ambassador to Israel could have implications for Arab governments; Friedman expressed the view that Palestinians should not have their own state after calling the effort to find a solution an \u201cillusion\u201d (cnnpolitics.com). Saudi Arabia expressed support for the Palestine\u2019s to have their own sovereignty, with China also taking the same view - stating in their Arab policy paper \u201cChina supports the Middle East peace process and the establishment of an independent state of Palestine\u2026\u201d (beltandroad.hktdc.com).\n\nChina and the Arab nations, particularly the GCC, are reliant on each other - the Arab nations have become China\u2019s biggest crude oil supplier and the Arabs import domestic machinery, technology etc. from China. If the GCC makes a deal with the incoming US administration that China does not support (or vice versa), the FTA might be delayed.
