I didn't find it super helpful in the end though, there's not enough books that sell for 9-18 weeks, most are either shorter are longer. If someone else can make use of this then do let me know. This forecast is fairly simple, I took a linreg of the book's position over time to get its forecasted level for the next 4 lists, calculated the z-score of a 15th place entry compared to forecasted value with SD calculated from the line's residuals. Converted each z-score to a p-value, then calculated the chance of none of them happening. In this model, for a rank of 15 or higher, June 20 has a probability of 14%, June 27 8%, July 4 4%, and July 11 2%. Chance of none of them is 74%.  I'm not sure how to factor in outside factors here, none seem very material. The chance of Adam publishing another great article and drawing attention is low since he hasn't published an article during the summer in a few years. Kahneman's new book may draw more attention to the genre and book since he endorsed Think Again, or may cannibalize its sales, hard to say.

My Own Words rebounded to 10-12-12 before dropping off again, and Killing Crazy Horse 12-13-14-14. Shade did 7-6-5-13, though that was also further away from its initial run so maybe less comparable.  I'm skewing further into the 14-18 bucket than I normally would because I'm wondering if the recent rebound is due to Adam publishing an article in the NY Times (on languishing) which was the second most popular article last week (https://www.nytimes.com/trending/ In Case You Missed It section) and that bringing more attention to the book. Most other non-fiction best-sellers are memoirs, books with political slants, or historical pieces, and most of the authors don't have the ability to grab the attention of a large groups of people who may not otherwise know who they are in the way that writing for NYT would do. Other books have definitely rebounded, but there's plausible reasons for at least some outside of just noise, like Shade and My Own Words rebounding after the election with court packing discussions and the Capitol riots.  If the article is why the current rebound is happening then I wouldn't expect it to last more than 1-2 more weeks tops, but it's reason to expect another one to occur in the future assuming any one of his next few articles between now and July 11 gain significant traction like the languishing one did. I still don't index into the higher bucket super heavily though. The current spike is on top of likely a high volume of people buying it because of \"normal\" reasons like word-of-mouth spread for a new release, so a similar spike may not lead to the book reaching a similar rank (i.e. the current spike lifted the book's rank to 9, but a spike of the same size may lift it to only 14 or 15 in the future if purchases for other reasons steadily decline between now and then). A future article published would need to gain a significant amount of traction, which is another if. The current run would also need to last another two weeks to have optimal chances of making it to 14 weeks off a future article, which is another big if if the languishing article was published 12 days ago and won't get the same amount of advertising by the NYT.  A few things need to fall into place in my current model of what's going on for the book to hit 14, but there's a plausible case to be made that it will happen.

First point is that it's pretty rare for a book to be on the list for 14-18 weeks. Since August 23, 22 books have been on the list at least once whose total number of weeks is >8 (and aren't on the current list). 8 have totaled 9-13 weeks, 12 have totaled 18+ weeks, but only two hit 14-18. Both of the books that hit 14-18 were from entries at rank 13-15, one for 1 week at rank 14 and one for 3 weeks at 15-13-15. The 9-13 books simply fell off the list at an average of rank 12. It seems like hitting the 14-18 bucket is mostly whether you luck into a couple extra lowest-rank weeks, which most books didn't do. The downward trajectory of Think Again is a bit too steep to justify a strong 18+ prediction, so a decent outside rate, admittedly based off of only 10 books, would be 80% 9-13 and 20% 14-18.  I temper that prediction a bit because Think Again has been performing above average compared to the 9-13 bucket, and has been slightly closer to the 14-18 one. Over their first 9 weeks, Think Again has been an average of 1.9 rankings above the average 9-13 book, and 1.2 below the average 14-18 book. It's been above the average 9-13 for 8/9 weeks, and above the average 14-18 in 5/9 weeks. These numbers are tiny, there's only 10 books to compare to, but this is just to say that the book's performance has been roughly mid-way between the two buckets, so an 80/20 prediction should be tempered a bit. Lastly, the sharp dip to #10 in week 3 for Think Again may mean something. Two other books had a sharp dip and then rebound like that, Humans and Blackout, and both lasted 9-13 weeks. All the books that lasted longer were more consistent over time, maybe due to more widespread advertising or word-of-mouth spread leading to more consistent sustained demand (or chance!). That only bumps the 9-13 bucket like 4-5%, it's only based on two other books, but something interesting to note nonetheless."], [1646, "2021-04-13T14:47:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.37, 0.58, 0.05], ""], [97522, "2021-04-13T14:31:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.25, 0.05], "Adjusting long term a bit.

The book's trajectory over time thus far is weirdly turbulent, which probably reflects the initial rush of people already familiar with the author and then the bandwagoners seeing it as a best seller that looks interesting, or people seeing the marketing materials like this forecasting question and then buying it.  There's a chance that the marketing and best seller hype dies down pretty quick and its only on for 8 weeks or less, but I'd imagine that the hype would take more time to percolate through the market than news would to his loyal followers. It did dip to #10 a couple weeks ago though and my narrative could be wrong, so I don't know.  9-13 seems the most reasonable for me.

The only specific male topic probably is \nWALK IN MY COMBAT BOOTS by James Patterson and Matt Eversmann with Chris Mooney ((4 weeks on the list) Rising high on the list, and staying there, usually pandered by either\n/being reknowned and/or famous (Bill Gates, the Obamas)\n/world-class achievements (Nobel-Prize laureates, award winning actors, Pulitzer prize winner), with an interesting life to depict\n/having an urgent and/or global and/or \"special\" topic of broad interest that has a non-exclusive target group and is easy to identify yourself with or\n/being billionaire (Bill Gates)\nIn the wake of the killing of George Floyd in 2020, the compound of African-American history, racial history, social injustice, women's rights and (Black) women who made it to the top, appears to be the topics with an extraordinary position among the bestsellers over the past 12 to 18 months; over the next 18 to 24 months, I predict the Bill Gates book (\"How to avoid climate disaster\") to have what it takes to become the next 100-weeks-blockbuster book, because of overlapping categories. It'll be a must-read.\nIt reveals as well that, for staying in the list for more than, say, 15 weeks, it requires to be special as an author, fame helps, but also a major achievement seems to be a reasonable indicator of a long appearance.\nAdam Grant as an author is neither female nor African-American, nor actor, famous, Nobel laureate (not yet, at least), self-made billionaire entrepreneur (at least not publicly known for it), nor does the topic fulfill any of the requirements for an ultra-long appearance. The book that comes closest to Grant's own by topic is obviously \n#15 THINKING, FAST AND SLOW by Daniel Kahneman Farrar, Straus & Giroux (23 weeks on the list), but the main difference between the two authors is, both being part of the scientific community, the long career and the Nobel prize for Kahneman (lifetime achievements). The time for self helper/self-optimizer literature appears to be over, as in times of the pandemic, economic and climate crisis, other topics appear more imminent, and the merits of self-optimization are hard to earn in a lock down/home office business environment. However, his current standing (#3 in week 5), his track record as a bestselling author, and his well-established position in the small niche of his semi-scientific topic, and his contribution to popularize the topic, make it unlikely for \"Think again!\" to have 10 or less weeks of appearance only on the list.\nThus I expect \"Think Again!\" to remain on the list half of the time of Kahneman's book (currently 11.5 weeks) and then not return. This confirms my initial calculus in this post, and my previous forecast.

So there is plenty of opportunity for persistence on this list. On the other hand, some books have brief stays on this list. Currently four books ave been on this list for three weeks or less. As a published author of nonfiction books myself, I know the mechanism whereby some books are only on this list briefly. If it still works the same way as when I last had reason to study it, the best seller list is biased toward new books that only reside there briefly because after a few weeks, if the book isn't selling well, distributors such as Amazon and other book sellers return unsold copies. These are subtracted from the total sold, causing a boom and bust effect. Right now, Grant's Think Again is on the cusp to the dread returns effect and thus could fall off the list with remarkable speed. On the third hand, days on the best seller count no matter how many days on not being there also might occur. So if sales figures fall off a cliff, they also could rebound as word of mouth gets around. Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow is an amazing example of longevity, and has much in common with Think Again. Both are well supported by research, well endnoted to academic standards, and both are easy, fun reads.  All that said, I was happily astonished by @crossonc 's use of base rate calculations on Adam Grant's previous books. https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1237726 They also are consistent with my use of Kahneman's book as a base rate.

For \"Give and Take\", \"Originals\" and \"Option B\" this was 1, 4 and 19 respectively. Average is 8 weeks. There are reasons to think that \"Think Again\" may do better than average as Adam Grant has a higher profile now & no. weeks on list has been increasing with each book. However, \"Option B\" was written in conjunction with Sheryl Sandberg and has HEAVILY skewed this average so think 8 weeks is a decent approximation here. 2) The average length of time books currently on the NYT list (07/03/2021) have spent on the list. The simple average here is ~10.5 weeks. However, if we divide the no. of weeks each book has spent on the list by the number of weeks since its publication, we get the \"no. of weeks on NYT list per week released\". The average no. weeks on NYT list per week released is 0.57. If we standardise this to a 20 week period (ie multiple the \"no. of weeks on NYT list per week released\" by 20), we can get the expected number of weeks any of these books will spend on the list in a 20 week period.  By doing this, we get the following distribution. Out of the 15 on the list, we expect:\n- Fewer than 4: 2 (ie 13%)\n- Between 4 and 8: 4 (ie 27%)\n- Between 9 and 13: 3 (ie 20%)\n- Between 14 and 18: 3 (ie 20%)\n- More than 18: 3 (ie 20%) 3) \"Think Again\" has already been on the NYT list for 3 weeks (falling from 1st to 3rd to 10th).
