It\u2019s good to put the money of people where their mouth is. For the prediction market, there is a 59% chance that there is a 59 percent chance that the republican is going to win.  The goodJudgemend open has the probability curently set at 57 percent. So we are going to set our baserate is going to be set at 58%.  According to the blogger, Prognasticating- Beek on GJO (Who has a 1.04 Brier Score) which is insane by the way. He has Sinema at a 65 percent chance of winning. So as a result, we\u2019re going to bump down the our probability to 48 percent chance of McSally winning the race.  The poles, except for Harris, has Senema winning. And Harris\u2019s poles are biased to begin with so that is just kind of dumb to use.  Voter Turnout: \nThe state of Arizona is just under 80% white. Also, it is very nice weather in Arizona today (as I\u2019m writing this) and tomorrow. As for other thing, this is Arizona\u2019s most voted mid-term ever according to Garret Archer on Twitter.  So, about 65 percent of the vote was in as of Saturday was in the poll.  But let\u2019s get down into to the brass tax. What would it take for the democrat to win in the election. There are 58,851 democratic people who have voted in the last three of four elections. There are 64,701 Republicans who have not voted. Making for just under a 6000 split.  What would it take for Sinema to win and lose: \nHere is the thing that really matters, President Trump is a (what ever the word that starts with a C and means a faster reaction, which is a catalyst). The winner will have to get Maricopa county in Arizona (where Phoenix is). And that is the large majority of the vote. \nTuscon is going blue, which holds about 1/7th of the population in Arizona.  I\u2019ll do some invistigating later on, but I\u2019m going to go with Senema at 68 percent chance. \n"], [23006, "2018-11-05T18:12:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2018-11-05T13:48:43Z", [0.66, 0.34, 0.0], ""], [62061, "2018-11-05T11:41:29Z", [0.37, 0.63, 0.0], ""], [31201, "2018-11-05T03:21:25Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [27155, "2018-11-05T01:00:07Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], ""], [27155, "2018-11-05T00:58:34Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [16501, "2018-11-04T19:25:47Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-11-04T19:25:10Z", [0.73, 0.27, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-11-04T19:11:43Z", [0.74, 0.26, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-11-04T12:35:32Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [767, "2018-11-04T01:28:05Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [4225, "2018-11-03T22:08:57Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [23006, "2018-11-03T20:09:48Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [43003, "2018-11-03T18:40:32Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0], "+10% Sinema Finally got to the bottom of Harris Interactive Polls and they are flawed methodology.\nhttps://scottrasmussen.com/methodology\nI now understand why 538 classfies them as C+.
