The effects of Covid-19 are to be seen. Kinshasa is under lockdown [3, 4]. The health system is not capable of dealing with high infection rates [5].  What does this all mean for Tshisekedi? Probably that nothing will happen.

Apparently, that deal is under strain.  Kabila currently controls a two-thirds majority in parliament. Under Tshisekedi, the Congolese government has introduced free primary education and undertaken infrastructure building and rehabilitation.  Since the DRC's domestic revenues were not sufficient to cover these expenses, the country's central bank (BCC) made monetary advances to the government.  This move has eroded the DRC's international reserves to low levels. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) met with Congolese officials on November 6 -15, 2019.  Due to the monetary and economic issues the DRC is facing, the IMF and the Congolese government reached an agreement that would be supported by Rapid Credit Facility (RCF, an IMF program that provides financial assistance with limited conditions to low-income countries).  This RCF is being monitored by IMF staff until May 2020.  Usually, it seems that whenever a country implements conditions imposed by the IMF, governments or heads of states loose power or a overthrown. It may appear that the spending the Congolese government made was to appease the people.  The government may want to appease its people because not much has changed in the DRC since Tshisekedi became president.  Economic growth is expected to drop in 2020.  Although Tshisekedi has a deal with Kabila, the two of them don't get along very well.  To deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Congolese government has enacted measures similar to other countries in the world. I believe that F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi will remain president of the DRC for all of 2020.  However, there is a possibility he may not remain president in 2021. Depending on the way events unfold, I may have to change my forecast.
