Sometimes, as has happened recently, the two-week update has a very significant change.  After a month or two the data doesn't usually change very much.  This question asks what will be the first estimate for Rt on 12/31/20.  It's only their best estimate, so yes, we should not expect to be able to nail it down very far in advance. As I understand it the current estimates of Rt take into account multiple variables -- primarily the slope of the average new infections (not sure if they use a 7-day or 14-day rolling average), but adjusted for the number of tests.  If new infections are going down, Rt should be less than one.  But if the number of tests decreases they estimate the number of infections that would have resulted if the testing had remained the same.  I could be in the weeds here, but that's my understanding of the algorithm.  And they may look at other data of which I am not aware.  The key point is that it's an estimate.  The first estimates are therefore highly volatile, pending a review of future data. Maybe it's early for a \"post-mortem,\" but I'll do one anyway.  I give myself a \"C\" grade.  Fairly early I correctly (so far) underweighted the highest range, but I also underweighted the lowest one.  I concentrated too much on the 3rd and 4th bins, along with many others.  I would have been better off using the more humble approach of putting 20 chips on each of the 5 bins.  I took that approach briefly, but then my mind tricked me into thinking I knew what would happen.  Overconfidence often leads me to over concentrate my bets.

The negative correlation has been steadily increasing, and is now about -0.42.  I posted a graph (Excel scatter plot) in Google Docs as a pdf for download.  Here is the link if you would like to view the plot. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0PGjfqxBDyT6AjRbxbAjQiAXeUFi2gBU8wlGxAbZ6s/export?format=pdf The blue crosshairs mark the average values for Rt and cumulative per capita positive tests.  Each dot represents a state.  Dots in the first and third quadrants contribute to a positive correlation; dots in the second and fourth quadrants contribute to a negative correlation.  As you can see, there are more dots in the second and fourth quadrants.  If you plot a line through the points it has a negative slope, or negative correlation. What does this mean?  Maybe nothing.  But it stands to reason that when a given geographic entity (city, state, or country) has a very high cumulative infection rate, at some point the rate of new infections will go down.  Likewise states that have seen very low infection numbers may be lax with social distancing and mask wearing, making them susceptible to increasing infections and corresponding higher values for Rt. The states with the highest Rt's are ME and VT (quadrant 2), which also have the lowest numbers for cumulative per capita infections.  Mississippi has by far the lowest Rt, and also has experienced above average total infections.  ND and SD are in a class of their own, with total infections over twice the national average.  Rt has recently begun falling for ND and SD.  I expect to see Rt continue to fall for ND, SD, WI, IA, NE, and other states that have high and increasing total infections.  If this happens before December 31, certainly a big IF, then the total number of states with Rt > 0.99 should decrease. Maybe this graph means nothing.  But I was curious about the correlation between Rt and total infections, so I made the plot.  Every day the dots move to the right as cumulative infections increase  Some dots move very slowly (e.g., ME); others move quite rapidly (WI, ND, SD).  Rt is more volatile.  It moves quite a bit on many days, and has generally been trending higher for the 3 weeks that I've been tracking it.  The average Rt is currently 1.161.  Average cumulative infections for the 50 states + DC is about 3.4%. It would be cool to make a \"Hans Rosling\" type of plot, showing how the dots move over time relative to each other. See https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en#t-290293 NY, NJ and Ct would be the first out of the starting gate.  Southern states (LA, AZ and others) caught up and moved ahead during the summer.  Now the third wave has seen the upper midwest rapidly move to the right.  Perhaps bubbles could be used to represent to total population of each state.  It would be interesting, but time consuming, to make plots for other geographies.  Just a thought ...

The states he listed with his prediction may very well see Rt < 1.00, but I would add some other possibilities. Rt is a volatile parameter; it's essentially an estimate of the rate of the change of new infections, i.e., the first derivative.  So it can change rapidly.  Several states have very high and rapidly increasing infection rates. My guess, and that's really all it is, includes ID, IA, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, ND, NE, NM, OK, RI, SD, UT, WI, & WY.

It's likely in my mind that some states will accept higher R0 for longer, pushing the expected number to maybe 30-35 with a wide variance. \n4) also testing is getting better, faster and more accessible, so a larger fraction of cases will be detected (I'm not sure of the net effect of this factor on the prediction because I'm sure the R0 estimation methodology must at least try to correct for this.
