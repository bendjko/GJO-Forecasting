This question and explanation offers no clues about which definition is correct, but whenever I read the question, I interpret it as most and thereby \"the greater quantity or share\".  Bernie will sweep in California, which will put him well ahead of his adversaries, He is also set up to do very well in Texas and even if he comes in 2nd, he won't be far behind in delegate count. The other big delegate states are North Carolina, Virginia,  Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado.  First, Bernie also will the majority of Colorado's delegates. Massachusetts and Minnesota and a two horse race between Bernie and not front-running candidates. Both Klobuchar and Warren will not get many delegates and likely get locked out of many states, especially considering they will both get poor finishes in South Carolina. Meanwhile, Biden, Bloomberg and Buttigieg will be lucky to get any delegates in Minnesota and  Massachusetts and if they do, it won't be very much and will further Bernie's lead. Then North Carolina and Virginia are a three-way crap shoot between Bernie, Biden and Bloomberg, It's hard to predict who exactly will win, but what is certain is that Bernie will do well and even if he comes in third, it won't be far behind and therefore any delegate's that his adversary gain on him will be small and not nearly enough to catch up to him after his California sweep. Of the rest of the States, they don't particularly have a high enough delegate count for a candidate to pull ahead in delegates, even if they completely swept the state, but that wont be the case, even though many of the more conservative states might favor Biden, Bernie will still be close behind preventing Biden or Bloomberg from making up much ground after failing to perform in California. Furthermore, some of the smaller states (VT, Maine, Utah, Democrats Abroad), Bernie is sure to sweep, thereby to making up any lost delegates in the other smaller states (Ark., Ala., Tenn., Okla.) Therefore, at the end of the day is seems mathematically impossible for Bernie to not win the majority of delegates on Super Tuesday , because of his huge win in California and other states, followed by the inability of his opponents to lock him out of a single state, while they are more then likely to get locked out of several and because he'll do \"well\" in every state, thereby, never being far behind even if he does not win a state."], [691, "2020-02-27T13:16:53Z", [0.21], ""], [18679, "2020-02-27T06:36:32Z", [0.15], ""], [79461, "2020-02-27T06:11:40Z", [0.38], "In light of no candidates dropping out after Nevada, I'm lowering my forecast slightly.

Obviously, if a candidate dropped out some of their voters would go to Sanders, increasing his likelihood of getting a majority of delegates on Super Tuesday. However, some of those voters would also go to other candidates and if those voters pushed the candidate over the 15% threshold that would decrease the number of delegates Bernie would win. I think the first effect is much more important, especially because candidates will concentrate their efforts in specific states where they are most likely to succeed. Warren in MA, Klobuchar in Minnesota, Biden in the south, etc. As a result, I think all of these candidates staying in will make Sanders less likely to win the majority, though he will almost certainly gain a plurality.

I just heard Carville, who managed two successful presidential campaigns, argue that the candidate who focuses on the issues that affect the daily lives of the average American will win the election.   After considering Carvile's comment, I am not sure Bernie does very well on the question: \"Does this candidate care about people like me?\"  This seems to be a question voters always ask and is perhaps the best indicator of who wins any election. Bernie is advocating such things as free medical care for illegal aliens and letting convicts vote.  These are not issues that move or excite the average voter.  Instead, the average voter worries about his own marginal wages (despite the recent increase) and paying for his family's medical care.

If we add in Bloomberg's strategy of targeting moderates, I would not be surprised if both of them take delegates away from Biden.
