ANALYSIS: To reach 1.75M units, Ford would only need to produce 90K units/month for the rest of the year.  They are well on track to do so.  Barring major catostrophe, Ford will exceed this threshold. To reach 2.0M units, Ford would need to produce 518557 in last calendar quarter.  In Q4 2020, Ford produced 517675 units.  But looking at production numbers from Aug. and Sept. 2021, they appear to be on track to do so.  I would expect lower numbers in Nov. and Dec. 2021 due to the holidays. To reach 2.25M units, Ford would need to produce an average of 256K units/month for the last three months of the year.  They have not reached those numbers in the past two years (even in pre-pandemic Jan. and Feb. 2020).  With the chip shortage, this seems highly unlikely.
