(After all, the price of gold is HIGHLY followed, which gives a highly efficient market, which means that the current price already factors in forecasts about future price movements.)  The main thing this model adds is to give a rough estimation of how likely the outlier outcomes are.  (So I find it a surprise that the group consensus is \"Almost 100% likely that the price will be between $1250 and $1350\", when historical fluctuations of +/- 50 USD/oz over the course of 6 weeks are not uncommon.) At least the answer \"buckets\" here are reasonably wide, and it would not be a surprise to see any of the outcomes.
