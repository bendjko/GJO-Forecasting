The threshold for an invite is lower than an actual visit which would push the probability up, but ongoing covid restrictions would push it lower. Note however, that the covid restrictions are EU and - per brexit - the UK is most definitely not in the EU.  Overall the fact that there hasn't been a head of state visit since 2017 is something I'm not sure how to handle - does it raise the odds or no? Mostly I think it shows the odds go lower when the two heads of state aren't politically aligned. And, to some extent, I think this logic holds with Biden. For example, he hadn't called the Australian PM regarding the Afghanistan pullout, and one explanation seems to be that Morrison is much more conservative. So in that vein, he might not be keen to invite Boris to the whitehouse.
