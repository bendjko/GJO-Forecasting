Historic data suggests that none of the Group III air carriers were in danger of bankruptcy before COVID made an impact. Similar to the automobile industry bailouts in 2008, massive government bailouts allocated resources to saving airlines effected by COVID (CNBC, 2020).

We now know that Congress has tabled any future discussions regarding a broader coronavirus economic relief package until after the election, the airline industry is seeking to push for a stand-alone bill that would pay front-line workers for an additional six months (Aratani, 2020). \u201cAfter Congress missed the Sept. 30 deadline for approving an extension, another stand-alone bill was introduced, to provide $25.5 billion to passenger airlines, $3 billion to airline contractors and $300 million to cargo carriers. As a condition of accepting the money, airlines would have to reinstate furloughed employees and provide them with back pay. But the measure failed to advance\u201d (Aratani, 2020).  Given what we know to be true, and due to the inability for Congress to pass any sort of bipartisan agreement or provide an extension to current payroll protections and that airline companies are beginning to layoff and/or furlough employees, I believe outside pressure will continue to mount and Congress will be forced into some sort of action.

Travel has taken a dramatic hit because of the pandemic, \u201con Wednesday, Transportation Security Administration officers screened just shy of 95,000 people at airport checkpoints, a dramatic drop from the 2.3 million who passed through on the equivalent day in 2019\u201d (Wallace, 2020). Airlines are losing money at a rapid rate and are having very little attendance, \n\u201ceven as Delta and the other major airlines in the United States dramatically slash schedules, they are averaging an anemic 23 passengers on each domestic flight and losing $350 million to $400 million a day as expenses like payroll, rent and aircraft maintenance far exceed the money they are brining in\u201d (Chokshi, 2020). \nEven though airlines are losing money at a consistent rate, group III carries have survived. Airlines have been able to survive by taking on debt, \u201c$67 billion of the new debt is composed f government loans ($50 billion), deferred taxes ($5 billion) and loan guarantees ($12 billion)\u201d (Garcia, 2020). Another way airlines have been able to survive is through furloughs, \u201cUnited Airlines and American Airlines have sent furlough notices to a total of more than 32,000 employees, saying they can\u2019t afford to have them on payroll after Thursday-the expiration date for the federal CARES Act Payroll Support Program\u201d (NPR,2020). Like all industries, air travel has been greatly affected. However, not every airline will furlough their employees, \u201c\u2018Southwest has no current plans for furloughs,\u2019 a company representative tells NPR, citing cost-cutting and voluntary agreements with workers. Delta is in a similar position\u201d (NPR, 2020). The airline industry is grim. However, it is my belief that group III U.S. carriers will do everything in their power to avoid declaring bankruptcy. While Virgin has already declared bankruptcy, I do not believe anyone else will.

Airlines are currently transitioning to cater to leisure travelers as business travel largely halted in midst of the pandemic and damaged economy with an observed 58% decrease in travel observed in April 2020 compared to 2019 (Josephs, 2020; Nguyen & Animashaun, 2020). The air industry received a $25 billion bailout in mid-April to keep them afloat through September (Rappeport & Chokshi, 2020). However, with no second bailout currently reached, airlines have begun to shrink through employee layoffs and groundings of aircraft to remain afloat (Egan, 2020).\n\tWith talks about a second economic relief bill at a standstill, the airlines are expected to continue to shrink up to 50% and continue to reduce prices and erroneous fees to entice travelers to purchase tickets (Egan, 2020; Josephs, 2020). According to Oscar Munoz former CEO of United Airlines, while the situation is dire and numerous airlines have filed for bankruptcy in the previous two decades following 9/11 and the recession, with layoffs and fleet reductions major carriers likely to survive through the year (Egan, 2020). While additional bailouts may not be reached prior to or even immediately after the election on 3 November, layoffs, fleet reductions, minor increases in leisure travel observed due to incentives, and roughly one and a half months left, I estimate there is a 10% probability that a Group III US air carrier will declare bankruptcy by 30 November.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/28/coronavirus-air-travel-focus-on-leisure-travelers.html https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/business/airline-jobs-united-munoz/index.html https://www.bts.gov/sites/bts.dot.gov/files/docs/explore-topics-and-geography/topics/airlines-and-airports/227546/number-332-air-carrier-groupings-2020.pdf https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/20/21224080/coronavirus-air-travel-decline-charts\n"], [45594, "2020-10-11T13:29:37Z", [0.25], ""], [783, "2020-10-11T03:32:19Z", [0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-10-11T01:58:11Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2020-10-09T18:24:48Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-10-09T13:24:42Z", [0.02], ""], [86342, "2020-10-09T11:34:31Z", [0.08], ""], [95444, "2020-10-09T08:09:51Z", [0.01], ""], [12694, "2020-10-09T02:03:20Z", [0.03], ""], [86554, "2020-10-08T16:38:12Z", [0.02], ""], [754, "2020-10-08T15:56:14Z", [0.01], "Capitulation 2.0  My skepticism against optimism re Covid effects on business, especially things like movie theatres, plane flights and cruises... has proven too strong. \n.....

Now, the nation\u2019s three biggest conventional airlines \u2013 American, Delta and United \u2013 all have FHRs below 40.

(Chadwick, 2020).  These air carriers have been kept afloat by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES Act), which extended payroll support to businesses and was signed into law on 27 March 2020. (Department of the Treasury, 2020).  Unfortunately, the CARES Act expired on 30 September.  This triggered layoffs at American Airlines and United Airlines, with Southwest Airlines warning layoffs could be coming soon (Ackley, 2020). Congress is currently considering an extension to the Payroll Support Program, but it is unknown if passing such a bill is likely to happen.  In fact, it is more likely that this bill is not passed due to the political considerations of the coming election.  It\u2019s no secret that President Trump is running on a platform which includes his economic success.  Massive layoffs in the weeks before Election Day might be considered desirable by his political opponents in the House of Representatives.   While President Trump might also consider using an Executive Order to extend payroll protection, he may not do so, electing to blame the lack of a bill on the Democrats.  There are several ways in which an extension which saves the Group III carriers does not happen, and only one in which it does \u2013 bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress agreeing to put politics aside to save jobs.  This is assuming such a bill is not spiked with a poison pill rider, which is also very possible.  Trump might sign the bill even if it included funding for liberal think tanks, simply to avoid responsibility for lost jobs. I\u2019m going to rate it as highly unlikely (5-10%) that legislative or executive action is taken before the election. The question is, can Group III carriers survive without payroll protection?  I believe the answer is yes.  Congress is not the body which can extend money to the airlines.  The airlines themselves have significant assets, to include their fleets and part ownership in airline terminals, which they can mortgage to obtain collateral for loans.  These loans can also be less secure, with higher interest, and I think it\u2019s very likely that big banks will be willing to make these loans.   I also think that after the election, Congress will be willing to pass the bill, whether Trump wins election or is a lame duck.  The question of survivability for the carriers, in my estimation, is only valid until the week after the election.  I believe that the airlines can survive the next 45 days, even without Congressional support.  I rate the confidence level at 70% that no Group III air carrier will declare bankruptcy by 30 November.

Therefore, we arrive at our baseline as follows: P(no default) = (1 - P(Alaska default)) * (1 - P(Allegiant default)) * ... * (1 - P(UPS default)). This gives us a probability of ~8%. Adjustments:\nPrivate companies:\nOne of the more obvious problems with this approach is that there are some companies that are private and thus do not have market implied default probabilities. To mitigate this problem, we looked at companies that have a high correlation with the private company (i.e. are public comparables) and looked at their default probabilities. Even though this is definitely not 100% correct, as there are idiosyncratic risk factors that this public comp analysis does not take into account, this is the fastest and quite accurate way of prediction without going into the publicly available reports of the companies and doing complex fundamental analyses.\nAssumption of independence:\nThe main problem with this approach is the fact that we do not think about the cross correlation terms between these occurrences. I.e. if one of the airlines is getting closer to bankruptcy, the other airlines will move closer to bankruptcy as well.\nNews updates:\nThe current administration has been very open to bailing out airlines early on and the administration has been lately discussing the possibility of another help package for airlines after some airlines suggested that they will need to cut a substantial part of their workforce after the first bailout funds are emptied (https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/08/26/could-a-second-airline-bailout-come-by-white-house-executive-order/). Conclusion: We increase our initial independent forecast by 50% to account for cross correlation, but we feel comfortable with this value given that we see it likely that the administration will give some temporary aid to these carriers if they need to.

For private companies I looked at whether they wer passenger or cargo airlines (as the effect of covid varies greatly between these subgroups) and took the group mean for each and then biased default risk up slightly due to the smaller size of the privately held companies which in increases default risk. This gave me a result somewhat lower than his 10%, I also think that the effect of correlations is overestimated, by making a small upward adjustment, I arrived at a 10% likelihood for a credit default. Now the probability of bankruptcy given a default is hard to find. Per creditriskmonitor \"companies in default are statistically more likely to survive than go bankrupt\".  There is also the possibilty that an airline would default before end of november and still not file for bankruptcy until after the end date. Since I have not been able to verify this number, and it may very between industries, estimate there is a 25% that an airline defaults but there is no bankruptcy filing.

One very important thing to recognize is that Congress approved a $50B bailout ($25B in loans, $25B in grants) to the airline industry earlier this year, which is massive considering that marketcaps of the largest airline companies (excluding UPS) now are around ~20B. It's also important to recognize that many of the 18 airlines listed have significantly smaller market caps <$5B, thus the total bailout is quite substantial for the airline industry. There are also talks that airlines may receive another bailout following the Sept. 30 date when airlines may start laying off some of their employees. All in all, however, it seems that likelihood of bankruptcy before Nov. 30, 2020 aren't as large due to the large amount of funding granted by the government, but the financial health for airlines in the future is still very undetermined.

As the money runs out without a travel recovery in sight, airlines and unions have lobbied Washington for another $25 billion, but talks have stalled as Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a broader coronavirus assistance package.

Seems like the way to check is calculate your Expected Brier Score, meaning, what your Brier Score would be on average for a question assuming you are handicapping it perfectly. For instance, say you think Event A has a uniform chance of happening over the course of 12 months of 80%. You could wager 80% at the start, reducing as time expires at an average rate of 20% (or 25% of your wager) per quarter. But my guess is a linearly sloped  reduction isn't optimal for this reason: if Event A happens, it could happen at any time. OTOH, if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen at the end of 12 months every time, meaning the average of all your forecasts are counted when the event doesn't happen, whereas when it does happen only your forecasts to-date are scored. So you want forecasts-to-date as high as possible when the event occurs and as low as possible when not.

The base rate for (at least one) Group III airline bankruptcies seems to be about 35% over the last twenty years, about 17% in a given six-month-period. So any individual airline has about a 1.5% chance of declaring bankruptcy in any given two-quarter period. Okay, now let's start looking at balance sheets. Here's American's Q1 balance sheet (https://s21.q4cdn.com/616071541/files/doc_news/assets/2020/1Q-2020-Financial-Results.pdf). Looks like they're paying about half a billion per quarter in debt service. American is up to about 100,000 passengers per day from a low of about 30,000 passengers per day. Seems like the average is about 500,000 per day. On average, they make about $10b per quarter, of which 75% is passengers. They typically also have roughly $10b in operating expenses. American will declare bankruptcy if they can no longer service their debt. Let's suppose that their revenue has dropped 80%, in line with the number of passengers, so they'll have $2b revenues per quarter. A lot of their costs will also drop- salaries, fuel, maintenance, marketing, and hotels *should* also drop. Prima facie, it seems like they should be able to move money around in order to service their debt. American also has $8b in assets, of which about half a billion is in cash. So they should be able to pay off their debt service at least through November, even if they have to sell assets to do it. I'm assuming here that they want to hold off on bankruptcy for as long as possible, since if they believe that demand will be depressed in the long term they have to know that bankruptcy may be inevitable. Taking a look at a few other balance sheets... Spirit was sitting on $1b cash at the end of 2020, and it looks like their debt service is around a quarter of a billion annually. How about freight? In 12/19, FedEx had $2b in cash, with debt service of almost $1b per *quarter.* Of course, they also have $65b in total assets, and it's not obvious to me that freight is suffering as much as passenger. How badly do companies want to avoid bankruptcy? I'm going to assume here that the management of these companies believes in maximizing shareholder value. If that's the case, then they'll do whatever they can to avoid bankruptcy. They may not succeed-- but I think the chances of what amounts to an instant bankruptcy before November are pretty slim. American, at least, will apparently have $11b cash on hand at the end of June (https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2020/05/10/airlines-are-racking-up-billions-in-debt-to-get-through-covid-19-can-they-survive-what-comes-next/), with loan repayments not due for years to come.

Although the Big Three U.S. carriers have basically pulled out of OAK, other airlines will be growing their schedules there in the weeks ahead, the airport said.

And some of that will be a resumption of Southwest\u2019s Hawaii service. The airport said Southwest is expected to resume its \u201cfull schedule\u201d of Hawaii flights in July, supplementing its twice-daily Honolulu service with two flights a day from Oakland to Kahului, Maui, and the return of service to Lihue, Kauai and to Kona on the Big Island. Southwest is gearing up for the August 1 removal of Hawaii\u2019s mandatory 14-day quarantine for all visitors, as long as they get a negative test result for Covid-19 before they leave home. (Since the new testing protocols were announced, the cheapest Hawaii fares have increased from $197 rountrip to around $280 roundtrip.) Hawaiian Airlines is also making a comeback, with plans to resume a \u201creduced schedule\u201d from its mainland gateways on August 1. In addition to a resumption of Honolulu-Portland service this week, Hawaiian said previously it will bring back daily Honolulu flights from San Diego and Sacramento on July 15. And this week it said its August 1 plans include the reinstatement of service from HNL to San Jose, Oakland, Phoenix, Las Vegas, New York and Boston. Hawaiian will also use A321neo aircraft to revive flights to Maui from San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento and Los Angeles; to Kauai from LAX and San Jose; and to Kona from LAX.

AP reports: People traveling to Chicago from 15 states with increasing numbers of confirmed cases of the coronavirus will have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival or face possible fines, city officials announced Thursday. To comply with the order that takes effect Monday, travelers must stay at a single home or other dwelling for 14 days except to seek medical care or be tested for COVID-19. As of Thursday, that means people coming from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah will be affected. Bay Area residents planning to visit the metro New York area \u2013 in fact, anywhere in New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut \u2013 might be dismayed to learn that California this week was added to the list of states whose residents must undergo a 14-day self-quarantine when they arrive there, based on California\u2019s recent coronavirus flare-up. According to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s executive order on the matter, non-compliance could result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000. You might be wondering how New York and its neighbors could enforce the quarantine rule, and that\u2019s a good question. As Cuomo explained it during a CNN interview, \u201cWe know what flight you came in on. And we\u2019ll have inspectors who are randomly looking at the names on the list and calling to follow up to make sure you\u2019re quarantining.\u201d But he added: \u201cI think most people are going to honor it.\u201d According to Routesonline.com, some Bay Area routes that Alaska Airlines had previously planned to offer this summer are now slated to begin on September 1 instead. That includes two daily E175 Horizon Air flights from San Francisco International to Boise and one a day from San Jose to Spokane, along with seven days of 737 service between SFO and Anchorage. Also due to start September 1 is new Alaska Airlines service between Los Angeles and Fresno (two daily E175s), a daily Portland-Denver 737 flight, a daily Portland-San Luis Obispo E175 flight, and a daily E175 roundtrip to Boise from Paine Field in Everett, Wash. However, Alaska\u2019s Seattle-Cincinnati route, previously set to begin August 18, has been pushed back to May of next year. Earlier this week, we reported on United\u2019s plans to bring back more domestic and international service during August. Now American Airlines has announced plans for the future of its international network into next year, and it\u2019s far from a V-shaped recovery. AA said it is planning a long-term \u201creset\u201d of that network that will mean a 25 percent reduction of its long-haul international capacity in the summer of 2021 compared to 2019 levels. Los Angeles International will take a big hit in American\u2019s revised long-haul schedule, losing service to Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Beijing, and Shanghai (assuming AA gets government approval for its planned start of Seattle-Shanghai flights as part of its new partnership with Alaska Airlines). The airline noted that it expects to resume LAX-London Heathrow flights this winter and LAX-Sydney service in summer 2021, and to launch LAX-Auckland flights in the winter of 2021. From the west coast, AA will depend on its Alaska partnership for future growth (Alaska is expected to become a full Oneworld member in 2021). In addition to moving its LAX-Shanghai route to Seattle, American previously announced plans to begin new transpacific service from SEA to London and Bangalore in 2021. American Airlines' \"reset\" of its international network will mean the end of several Los Angeles routes.\nAmerican\u2019s plans also include the elimination of some international routes from its other hubs, including Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Miami, Chicago O\u2019Hare and Philadelphia. A spokesperson noted that American will \u201ccontinue to fly to joint business partners\u2019 hubs. And while some international markets will not return, American anticipates a full schedule to LHR by 2021. The airline will continue to work closely with British Airways to provide an extensive network that allows customers to reach key destinations when they are ready.\u201d Click here to see all the details of American\u2019s announcement and international schedule changes.

The airline will use its trademark ERJ-135s on all the routes.

(2020). American Airlines May Be The First Airline Bankruptcy, But It Will Not Be The Last. Seeking Alpha. June 14, 2020. Retrieved from\nhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4354359-american-airlines-may-be-first-airline-bankruptcy-will-not-be-last Summary\nThe only reason AAL has not already filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, is the prospect of government largess and the admirable tenacity of Doug Parker. Countries that have or are very close to eradicating Covid-19 are now working on plans for a \u201ctravel bubble\u201d where travel between those countries will not be restricted. For relatively shorter trips, Covid-19 makes automobiles now much more attractive than air travel. People in cars don\u2019t wear masks, sit near strangers or interact with others in airports. Without infusions of cash from the government, there is no possibility that any of the legacy airlines get to breakeven as long as Covid-19 is still a significant factor. The nature of the business, causes most legacy airlines to use tremendous operating and financial leverage. Bankruptcy has been a very common occurrence in the airline industry. It usually does not take much of an unforeseen adverse event to push major airlines into bankruptcy. On September 14, 2005, Hurricane Katrina pushed both Northwest Airlines, then the nation's fifth-largest airline and Delta the country's third-largest carrier, into bankruptcy within hours of each other. After that day, half the seats on flights in the United States were offered by airlines operating under court protection. United Airlines had already filed for bankruptcy, never being able to recover from the impact of 9-11. All common shareholders in those airlines received zero recovery in those bankruptcies as their shares were cancelled.\n"], [92442, "2020-06-19T23:43:20Z", [0.8], "Some Group III careers are smaller or mostly freight.
