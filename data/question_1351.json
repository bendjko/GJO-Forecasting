With particular focus on Germany, largest ecomony in the EU, and the possibility of a recession. ECB Stimulus will only achieve so much with market conditions, such as trade wars, Brexit, and a global trend of slow growth, working against it. 4) The in coming President, Lagarde is reported to be a consensus builder.

The out going President used his position to force it through. Lagarde may then seek to reconcile the governing council, reducing the probability of further cuts.
