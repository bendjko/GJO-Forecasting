May easily secured a spot in the top five early on.\" You would think the rising tide of EV sales would positively impact the Bolt, but if the estimated sales numbers are to be believed, it has not. GM decided at the end of the 1st quarter 2018 that it will switch from monthly sales reporting and only release numbers at the close of each quarter. So, it will be July before we have a solid handle on Chevrolet Bolt sales numbers. The report goes on to say, \"we see Bolt deliveries down at the moment, with Volt sales ramping up. This is all related to the situation with inventory. GM has upped production and inventory of its aging plug-in while beginning to reduce Bolt allocations.\" With Tesla's Model 3 production ramping up, The Bolt, which starts at $37K and goes 238 miles on a charge, is competing with the elegant Model 3 which starts at $35,000 and can go as much as 300 miles between plugins. Also, according to GM spokesperson Jim Cain, \"Bolt sales fell due to lack of inventory.\" With 5 of 6 months worth of data in, the sales numbers for June would need to be to jump by 186% over May's to get to 10,000 units sold for the first six months of 2018 This is highly unlikely...\n"], [57918, "2018-06-04T16:48:27Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-06-04T13:50:22Z", [0.97, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-04T11:32:35Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "They'd need a record month to hit 10k, and that's not the recent trend."], [1993, "2018-06-04T06:03:46Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "6775 so far this year with only one month to go."], [13377, "2018-06-03T21:15:52Z", [0.81, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39938, "2018-06-03T19:43:14Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41707, "2018-06-03T16:03:59Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-03T12:38:29Z", [0.81, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-06-01T20:18:21Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Even less likely given latest numbers from here: https://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/ My lack of absolute certainty accounts for mainly uncertainty in the reported numbers as well as the small chances of a major ramp (would have to be 3225 from just above 1k in the last couple of months) "], [30610, "2018-06-01T19:10:10Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40702, "2018-06-01T18:50:22Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "I wish I could double down...

This year they didn't have the inventory back log; they had ceased all financing options.  Additionally,  no new model for 2018.  And a new competitor in the neo with better range, and newer styling. But  neither my post nor my forecast made it.  LOL.  Oh well.  GM loses 7-9,K per car.    And that picture does not get any better, any time soon, with the 7K incentives dropping out.  Thinking strategically here for a minute - Tesla needs to bet the farm on EV's.    GM doesn't.  Being the #2 manufacturer of EV's in the US is probably good enough.     Good enough to stay in the game, if it takes off; good enough to stay abreast of technology.  But fundamentally, the range of the EV's  isn't good enough, the recharge times isn't good enough.  The price isn't good enough.  The recharge infrastructure isn't in place. Barra has a reputation for watching the bottom line.   And I think she's played this exactly right.    Keep GM in the game.   Get enough buzz to keep people interested.    As I said in a previous post, I think the market for battery cards is not big (yet?); Tesla and tesla reservations are getting most of em.   7K per car is a lot of loss.   OTOH, idling a production line also involves loss.      So I could see GM putting incentive on cars to move them.  BTW Barra is pretty confident that congress is going to extend the tax credit.  Prognosticating this is going to get more interesting since GM has announced they're not going to do monthly totals any more...  Interestingly  the Volt sold more cars than the bolt - the volt had incentives, which points to just how sensitive consumers are to sales. TLDR if they sell at last year's pace - they only hit 8900.

I've given the above projections different weighting and came up with an average projection of 25,160...But that doesn't account for any loss of sales resulting from the repeal of the federal tax credit, which is very difficult to predict.

Dateline 10-6-2017 Resources are being diverted to address the bottlenecks holding back the Model 3, Musk wrote in a tweet Friday. He\u2019s also delaying the semi unveiling to Nov. 16 because Tesla is prioritizing efforts to increase battery output for Puerto Rico, which has sought the company\u2019s help to restore power following Hurricane Maria. Tesla built only 260 Model 3 sedans during the third quarter, less than a fifth of its 1,500-unit forecast.

Aug. sales: 2,052. There now are currently 1235 Bolt EV\u2013certified stores in the United States, ~40% of the 3000 U.S. Chevy outlets. Analysis: It only is possible to buy the Bolt via a certified Chevy dealer. The number of such dealerships has been increasing rapidly.  Thus with the dealership bottleneck having widened, we can expect higher average monthly sales than what we have seen so far. Even a straight line projection disregarding increasing dealerships, we get 2017 sales of 17,505.  In the worst case, assuming average monthly sales of 1/12 of the projected 2017 sales, and presuming no black swan, Jan. -- June 2018 sales would be at least 8,752. For a less pessimistic projection, assume Aug. sales levels continue through Jan. -- June 2018: 12, 312. Because of new dealerships and rising monthly sales, and in particular Aug. sales, I am zeroing out the less than 10K bin. Now for the top bin, production constraints are likely to hold through the forecast period. So it may not be possible to ramp up sales much beyond 2500/month. This gives a ceiling of ~ 15,000 -- 20,000. On the other hand, Aug. sales suggest that it may be worthwhile to immediately begin investing in higher production facilities. So I'm putting some probabilities int he top two bins for now. Sources:  Dateline Sept. 6, 2017 -- General Motors (NYSE:GM) said it delivered 2,052 Chevrolet Bolt EVs in the United States in August. It was the best month yet for the little electric crossover. ..Long story short: The Bolt may already be close to sales \"success\"\nI strongly suspect that GM will be pleased if the Bolt can sustain about 2,500 sales a month -- pleased enough to accelerate its development of more electric models.

It brings the total delivered of the new all-electric vehicle in the US to 7,592 units since the beginning of the year and just over 8,000 since its launch in December 2016. In June, GM opened Chevy Bolt EV orders for approved dealerships nationwide, But that didn\u2019t contribute to deliveries since the first shipment to the new approved dealerships are expected in August. At that point, we should have a better idea of the market for the Bolt EV. In the meantime, it\u2019s still not clear if the vehicle is still production constraint or if it\u2019s a demand issue. In certain markets where the vehicle is officially available, it can be difficult to get your hands on one, while in other markets, like California, there are decent inventories and some customers have been getting away with paying $25,000 after incentives due to discounts.

GM\u2019s Chevy Bolt EV deliveries last month rose to 1,566 units, which is still below the rate needed to achieve its target, but it\u2019s still a significant increase. The increase last month can be explained by the vehicle reaching more states. As per GM\u2019s own distribution plan, the Bolt EV is supposedly in dealerships in California, Oregon, Massachusetts, Maryland,  and Virginia since the beginning of the year. New York, New Jersey and Washington were added throughout the first quarter and deliveries in Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Colorado started in May.\nSource:  https://electrek.co/2017/06/01/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-sales-2/ "], [83, "2017-08-19T20:50:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [4423, "2017-08-19T20:39:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9, 0.0], ""], [28091, "2017-08-19T16:33:41Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [12879, "2017-08-19T15:10:58Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [30610, "2017-08-19T15:07:14Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.4, 0.45], "Demand:\nThey are selling at a 37k$ price before federal tax credit(GM is taking a loss on this) => 30k$ after credit which is lower than the average car price in US, hence don't think demand should not be an issue.
