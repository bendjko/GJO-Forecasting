More importantly, the IAEA gave Iran the green light to export 8.000 ton of enriched uranium, allowing it to move towards 300 kg  [2] 3. The export of 8.000 does not bring the total below the 300 kg in my calculations based on the IAEA values in the report [3], Iran has in total the equivalent of 12,639.6 kg of 3.5 percent LEU hexafluoride. The inventory is 8,305.6 kg of 3.5 percent LEU hexafluoride and the equivalent of another 4,334 kg of 3.5 percent LEU hexafluoride in various chemical forms at the EUPP. This stock of 3.5 percent LEU has increased by 460 kg since August 2015 [3]. Doing the math, exporting 8.000 ton would leave 4.639 ton of material.

South Africa took nine years to dismantle most of its nuclear program, which had even produced atom bombs before its end was ordered in 1990. The main effort was completed with the decommissioning of an enrichment plant in 1999. Iran, which denies that it ever sought to make nuclear weapons, is stopping short of that: Natanz, Iran\u2019s main enrichment site, will remain open, with 5,000 centrifuges.  . . . \n. . . \nFor years, Iranian officials have ducked the questions, arguing that they are based on documents fabricated by Israel and the United States and that Iran\u2019s experiments have been for peaceful purposes.  . . .  \"Then there is the issue of inspections. . . .  the agency\u2019s overstretched inspection staff is supposed to monitor the Natanz and Fordo enrichment plants . . .

Perhaps it could, in a pinch, decide that the stockpile is appropriately reduced if the material is merely moved from wherever is it now to one of the IAEA secure facilities to be established in Iran. As cmeinel pointed out, IAEA showed this kind of flexibility over Parchin. According to that state.gov link, Iran currently has a stockpile of 10 tonnes of enriched U. Physically reducing that by 97% to 300 kg by moving it all across the border is a logistics problem, as several forecasters have pointed out, but not as big as it first appears. There is a well-established industry for moving this stuff around. See\nhttp://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Transport/Transport-of-Radioactive-Materials/ Let's assume the enriched U exists because it was intended for a sprint to bomb-grade material. It would then likely be stored the form of uranium hexaflouride (hex) so that it would be ready to feed a gas centrifuge. There are standard containers for transporting this kind of stuff (see above link). One of them is a so-called 30B, about a meter across and two meters long, holding 2 tonnes of hex. 10 tonnes of U translates to about 15 tonnes of hex, so we're talking about 8 type 30B containers, each of which could be transported in a pickup truck. Okay, an American pickup like a F350 or a Ram, not one of those dinky Toyotas you see all over the middle east, but still --- eight truckloads.  Not so bad. We don't know how it is stored, but 30Bs are likely candidates for that, too, because hex is chemically such nasty stuff. If you can buy a standard set of couplings and learn a standard set of handling procedures that have 50 years of industry experience built in, why would you go reinvent it? Iran's intention may be malicious, but that doesn't make their engineers stupid. Jean-Pierre points out that Ulyanov says there are \"technical difficulties\" involved in the set up. I'm going to be charitable and take that as a diplomat's use of the term \"technical,\" meaning who is involved, who has authority, who foots the bill, etc. etc. -- in other words, the technicalities of the human factors. That kind of technicality could well stretch out a timeline, but they are also amenable to a swift kick if they get in the way of other priorities. Physical technicalities are not.
