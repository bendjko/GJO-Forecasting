Not unreasonable, and a lower drop than recent trend, with an average drop of almost 20% a week for the last four weeks. Next, what might be driving changes in case rates?  The weather may have driven testing down, but the reduction in cases over the past week has only been slightly above trend, and positivity rates are also down: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states It's hard to discern any Super Bowl surge.  There are reports of variants gaining traction but not actually leading to material increases in case counts, and even if the rt for variant cases is 50 to 70% higher than for \"COVID Classic\", the base isn't yet high enough to drive real change in overall counts.   My hunch is that the cold weather this week is leading more people to stay home generally (obviously it's leading more people to stay inside, but that alone wouldn't lead to a decrease if people, say, went out to eat indoors rather than out).  Vaccinations are beginning to have an effect at the margin.    Overall, I think it's more likely than not that cases will continue to decline for the next couple of weeks, at least, but I honestly can't put my finger on a solid explanation why.  Various public health and political leaders have been busy congratulating the public for the reductions, and attributing them to increased adherance to distancing and masking, but I'm not seeing big positive changes in those.  To the contrary, multiple states and cities have been reopening restaurants and, to a lesser extent, bars, which in the past has reliably lead to increases in cases.   I'll continue to ponder this.

Seven-day average as of yesterday is 95k/day. Is that the \"real\" number? @SE_Meyer makes the clever observation that the cold spell this week may have inhibited testing. Testing does seem to have been a bit lower last week, and in any case has been dropping since post holiday peak on January 18 and mini peak on January 30 (https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-tests). Multiple news reports from around the country noted closed testing centers because of winter weather. CDC reports tests per 1000 people dropped 25% -- although that could be because there is less transmission and therefore fewer people seeking to be tested. Still, I'll assume that numbers of new cases reported over the past 7 days were lower than they would have been without winter storms. The NWS has winter storm warnings in place for 120 million Americans between now and Tuesday, 2/16.  Might we see a \"bounce\" in new cases after that, as folks bundled up at home decide to go out and wait in line to be tested?   @Harvey-the-Rabbit notes the challenge of new, more transmissible, strains. CDC suggests new variants are firmly in place in Florida and California, centers of gravity for the pandemic in the US (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html). CDC models suggested the new variant would become the dominant one in March, with the steepest part of the growth curves in mid-March (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm?s_cid=mm7003e2_w#F1_down).    The ending of any Super Bowl surge is downward pressure on these numbers, but new strains emerging is slight upward pressure over timeframe of this question. Quite possibly winter weather suppressed testing and therefore led to fewer new reported cases this past week.

Pessimistic case: A Morning Consult Poll finds that 27% of adults are likely to attend or host a Super Bowl party with friends or relatives outside their house.[2] With approximately 228 million adults, that means 61 million adults will be shouting, cheering, as well as drinking and eating chicken wings, both of which require removing a mask. The CDC has collected forecasts ranging from 440,000 to 1.1 million weekly infections for the week ending February 27 from its partners in forecasting.[3]  When I looked at the underlying data and discussion, however, the CDC noted that the vast majority of forecaster partners use a static model, assuming everything will stay the same with respect to interventions, including social distancing.  Therefore the average value 770,000 weekly cases does not account for what is transpiring right now on Super Bowl Sunday. In my estimation, then, the most likely scenario is flat-lining the current rate for another three weeks or a much gentler decline than we would have had under all the very favorable conditions in the last several weeks.  So I put the balance of probability at 750,000 to 1,050,000.
