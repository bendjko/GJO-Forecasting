His skyrocketing salary, up to a few years ago can be viewed online-by some legal technicality, it won't be publicly disclosed in the future, but what this demonstrates is that he is hitting his internal NFL benchmarks or metrics; he is accomplishing whatever he's promised internally, or at least is maintaining positive perceptions inside with at least enough of the key decision makers to stick around and keep getting huge pay increases.  My understanding is they sort of groomed him for the job, and it seems to me the NFL likes having long-term commissioners, it projects stability and strength. This jibes with the reasons why some previous commissioners had gotten fired or retired earlier than expected, excluding those temporary stand-in commissioners e.g. the former FBI investigator who was their CFO for a while; one of their commissioners was let go, or had his contract not renewed for being perceived as weak willed. Another guy who was instrumental in resolving intra-league and team disputes and catching up with the AFL on TV marketing money left 2 years before his contract was over to take more time with his family.  It sounds like NFL commissioner is a pretty stressful job in a lot of respects--you're sort of nailing a chicken coop in a tornado, and it seems everyone hates you, the players and the fans, but the show must go on.  He also has some long range plans, including big words like 2020 lol, potentially he's sold the board off on these ideas and somehow has convinced everyone his continued presence is required to make it all go off; so perhaps his plans to help the NFL out of it's frustrating business model where they have tons of business operations but really low profit for a company making that much revenue.  It doesn't seem like the recent scandals, including deflatagate, will be enough to turn the tide against Goodell before the start of the season; this seems particularly true because of recent reports of the ongoing court proceedings where judges have made some pretty accusatory statements about Brady's behavior (e.g. cell phone destruction) that signals that maybe Brady's genius move to take it to the courts wasn't so genius.  Admittedly, I know extremely little about football; just not seeing any action potential reflected in current media sampling that is indicating momentum to eject Goodell at this point, and the thing with the highest potential to do so \"deflatagate\" seems to be backfiring on Brady. A bit tired now, but may come back and put in the links to some of these points and fill in the names for the commissioners I was referring to above. 3/19/16 There is another possibility that the deflatagate courts move was simultaneously helpful to Brady but also a strategic attack by Robert Kraft to end Goodell's commisionership in scandal, which 3/19 media suggests might be happening, but there is a degree of unpredictability in going before the judges, so it would be hard to know exactly how well whatever happens (which could not be entirely known to Kraft beforehand) would play into his heads, were there in fact this plot; there is a wild-card element to this strategy--but perhaps they just wanted to heap more general disapproval on Goodell and hope for the best. Also, I don't yet know enough about the situation to know if Kraft thinks his problems would be over if Goodell resigned.  I'm pretty keen to learn a bit more about the Goodell /Kraft relationship to begin with; i.e. what is the extent of Kraft's power and Goodell's; why was a strategic alliance mutually beneficial to begin with. Or were they, from the start, only partners to avoid mutually assured destruction? I understand Goodell is perceived as a key figure in the NFL revenue generation machine, and that Kraft has, at times, perhaps been the only key ally Goodell has had and helped him to stay in the game. Beyond this I don't know much more; be keen to see what some of the early deals official/unofficial/speculative under the table agreements that are likely to have transpired, and were those commitments honored sufficiently from both sides. I'd like to understand if the Ray Rice and Brady deflatagate things are open secrets among NFL business followers as part of a pretty much blatant, calculated, targeted attempts by Goodell to somehow undermine Kraft who he perceives as being too powerful in some respect? The answers to these questions will be discoveries for me for my own benefit, and most likely, not as much for those of you who follow the NFL.  The news today had me quite worried about my ultra high outside chances forecast on this one, but I am going to hold tight for a few days, see how things play out, see exactly who the fallout from deflatagate will be falling on before I scale down. 4/25/16 Updates This popped up on radar today; although this news will potentially make Goodell more unpopular with the fans, the courts decision validates Goodell's authority and his decision to suspend Brady, so generally speaking, this judgment speaks to Goodell's credibility.

To answer this question, I broke it down into more specific ones\u2014S in CHAMPS KNOW (select the right questions to answer and forecasts to make). Since the owners decide on his employment status, I asked two specific questions relevant to them: has Goodell made money for the owners, and have any new scandals arisen in the recent playoffs or thereafter? On the first question, as commissioner Goodell has brought in billions for the league through massive TV contracts and successful promotion of the NFL. Success in this respect is perhaps most important to owners, as the league is a business for them. On the second question, the NFL seems to have had a good season avoiding scandals, and since the Super Bowl, no new information about potential NFL-wide scandals has arisen that would lead to Goodell\u2019s firing. With both of these questions answered confidently (based on available information), there seems to be a 97% chance Goodell will be brought back in 2016. Nevertheless, W from CHAMPS KNOW (wildcards, accidents, and black swans can catch you if you don\u2019t consider the risk of irreducible uncertainty) encouraged me to be more careful in my judgment. Because of the nature of scandals to come out of no where, and the natural possibility that natural causes hinder Goodell\u2019s ability to be commissioner, I adjust downward to 92%--representing caution for unexpected events that would lead to his firing."], [16025, "2016-03-01T20:21:12Z", [1.0], "C Though Goodell\u2019s contract is set to run through march of 2019, it is important to note some of the differences between him and the previous commissioner, Paul Tagliabue. Tagliabue is widely believed to be one of the best NFL commissioners the league has seen. During his tenure, there was never a single player lockout or strike, and he took the league to new heights through his strategic TV deals and publicity campaigns. Goodell, however, has had a much more controversial history as commissioner and is not heavily favored by many of his peers in addition to NFL players and fans. \nH There has yet to be a commissioner in history that has had his contract terminated, and that fact will most likely not change with Goodell. His secure contract along with extensive support from various NFL owners will help keep his job safe. \nA There has been no news or headlines to change the last forecast regarding Goodell\u2019s job security, and it appears to be a near certainty that he will be commissioner next season. In addition, the 2016 season is officially over, and there will be little activity within the NFL until the next season, so Goodell will have little involvement and thus little room to make any controversial decisions. \nM Considering recent polls and surveys regarding Goodell, it is clearly that he is not extensively \u201cliked\u201d within the greater football community, however no models or statistics have shown that his tenure as NFL commissioner is anywhere near over in the years to come. \nP It becomes difficult to make a post-mortem analyses given the fact that the 2016 season has not started, however recent data indicates that he will indeed be the commissioner for the upcoming season. \nS Questions to consider are: How will Goodell respond to ongoing lawsuits with head trauma from former players? How will he respond in the future in terms of league policies and player misconduct? These are driving questions that pertain to how Goodell will be perceived by the public. \nK The key players that may influence Goodell\u2019s job security are himself, the players, and NFL owners. \nN Goodell can consider his job security safe unless he is found to violate the integrity of the NFL, which is the only grounds on which he can be voted out of the NFL. Such integrity came into question with the Ray Rice scandal, however since then a similar event has not resurfaced. \nO Another perspective to take into account is that of NFL owners. Take for example, Robert Kraft of the Patriots. The two have been accused of having mutually beneficial relationships in which Goodell lets Kraft cheat while Kraft ensures that Goodell keeps his job amid all of the controversy. \nW A potential wildcard could be a player misconduct issue that arises before the 2016 season that Goodell handles extremely poorly. Only such a scenario may lead to his contract termination for the upcoming season. \n"], [15980, "2016-03-01T19:29:23Z", [0.95], "To change this prediction, I am using the \"Adjust and update your forecasts when appropriate\" method of CHAMPSKNOW. While I still think that there is a very high likelihood (almost definite) of Goodell returning as commissioner for the 2016 season, there are 2 factors that are causing me to lower slightly from 99-95.  1. First, under Goodell, the NFL revenues are expected to exceed $13 billion in 2016 (http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbelzer/2016/02/29/thanks-to-roger-goodell-nfl-revenues-projected-to-surpass-13-billion-in-2016/#2384b3283278). This makes me think that there are strong reasons to bet that Goodell will not be going anywhere, which is why I keep my prediction so high.  2. Another piece of information is the lawsuit from Tony Romo's company against the NFL, which partly seeks to depose Goodell. As of yesterday, while a judge threw out one aspect of the lawsuit, the part to depose Goodell is still on the table (http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article63176942.html).

Some of the reasons include 1.) Despite owner Robert Craft of the New England patriots calling Goodell out and scrutinizing his decision to uphold Tom Brady's suspension and their forfeiture of draft picks, Goodell has the backing of a majority of the owners in the league, and many of the most powerful as well such as Jerry Jones, Jeffrie Lurie and the Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who is among the richest owners in the league and is moving his franchise to LA next year. It is also important to note that Goodell took a backseat in the debate over which franchise would move to LA next year. It was a heated debate and Goodell chose to take a backseat to ensure that he wouldnt waste any of his political capital (which he has lost alot of in recent years) by choosing one side over another. However, there are some other factors which need to be considered that could change this forecast if they occurred. Some factors that could alter this prediction and give Goodell less of a chance to be commissioner next year would be 1) how he handles the Johnny Manziel discipline situation. 2) How his appeal of Tom Brady's deflategate case decision plays out 3) if any other major discipline issues arise which he handles in a way that is not met favorable by the public. However, I believe that the chances of these potential factors playing much of a role in if he is commissioner next year are very small and will not make much of a difference. Historically, there has been six commissioners in NFL history and they average reign has been about 13 years, and amny of the shorter terms came in the early days of the league, skewing this data's average to be a little smaller than we would expect. As a result, I would expect Roger Godell to have a 99% chance of being the commissioner next year, mostly due to the fact that he has the backing by a majority of the most powerful owners.

The most likely cause of him leaving is the risk that a new scandal breaks (eg related to concussions, some personal embarrassment to Goodell, meddling in disciplinary hearings, handling of investigations into scandals, etc)  or he is found to have tampered in deflategate he would likely resign.
