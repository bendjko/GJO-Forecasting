This program has been delayed due to the failure of the Long March 5 in July 2017.  With the further successful launch tests, this program is back with a launch date of 2019 (no month reported) (according to Xinhua News) or December 2019 (according to a NASA news source).\nSince the time frame in this question is landing on the moon by 30 September 2019, I calculate the probability using the above two news sources.  For Xinhua, it is 0.75 (9 out of 12 months).  For NASA, it is 0 (launch date in December 2019).  We get an average probability of 0.36 of having China landing on the moon, just using the reported launch dates.\nChina has been quite successful in its moon programs but their success (with delays) is not guaranteed.  If I use a 80% success rate (a relatively high success rate), this reduces the probability of success to 0.8*0.36=0.29.\nIndia has never landed on the moon.  Its moon programs have not been well-established.  Even its project manager expressed doubts about the ability to keep to a schedule.  So I put its success probability at a low of 2% (somewhat arbitrarily).\nIsrael moon project appears to be an offshoot from a unsuccessful X-Price program.

The object of \"landing on the moon\" was actually fairly reliably achieved with 1970's technology.  The threat to those missions was mostly launch failures (and even then, generally in the Soviet pre-1970 missions), and the Chang'e-4 mission has already cleared the \"launch\" and \"lunar orbit\" hurdles without failure. The only new twist is \"using a relay satellite to communicate with the lander\".  Communication via relay satellites is also a relatively mature technology, and although the mission has a higher chance of landing failure than for a near-side mission, its chance of landing failure would still have to be much lower than for a Mars mission.  (Comms delay will be a few seconds for Chang'e-4, and is 4-24 minutes for a Mars landing mission.) So I have nudged the odds of Chinese landing success up from 10:1 to 15:1.  Other odds remain the same.\nIsrael's chances drop below 0.005, and thus round to 0%. ***********************************\nFOR DEBATE\nOn 3 January, the lander is released from the Change'e-4 spacecraft ... and no further communications are received from the lander (or rover).  Mission failure, yes, but might this still count as China \"landing on the moon\"? I ask because the Beagle-2 Mars mission in 2003 had this exact thing happen.  However, 12 years later, hi-res images from a subsequent NASA mission suggested that Beagle-2 did in fact make a soft landing, but the communications antenna was unable to successfully deploy. In this situation, TECHNICALLY the question should resolve as \"China\".  However, in practical terms, unless there can be proof provided that the Chinese lander made a soft landing BEFORE another nation (say, India) is able confirm their own soft landing, I strongly suspect that the question will close prior to 1 Dec 2018, and resolve as \"India\".  And my forecasts are made on that assumption.

The description notes that crashes and impacts (presumably intentional or unintentional) don\u2019t count. I\u2019ll start then by refining the definition to mean a successful \u201csoft landing.\u201d Since most extra-terrestrial landings are designed for a scientific mission beyond simply landing on the desired object (e.g., exploration, geology, etc.) a successful soft landing does not equate to a successful mission, which may have multiple prongs designed over several hours to several years, depending on the lander. So I\u2019ll simply define a successful soft landing as one in which the lander comes to rest on the object within acceptable design parameters and is acknowledged as doing so through designed/planned communications means with the lander to confirm that it has, in fact, landed safely. Whether other scientific experiments/rovers/instruments are successfully deployed subsequent to landing I will deem to be irrelevant, unless they relate to the ability of the lander to accurately report the initial landing status.  Next, I considered the relevance of probabilities for each of (1) overall spaceflight success rates, (2) success rates of spaceflights designed with soft landings, and (3) success rates of lunar landings in particular. In some instances (e.g., China Chang'e4, the probability of overall spaceflight success rates is not relevant because the mission to launch the lander has been successful thus far, with only the deployment and landing phases really impacting the probability of a successful mission). The success rate regarding extra-terrestrial landings in general (and lunar landing in particular) is quite high and continues to increase in the 21st century (as evidenced by successful landings on asteroids, a comet, the moon, Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, and, of course, Mars). With the exception of Mars, the landing success rate on other extraterrestrial bodies has been high. In the case of moon landings, only China has landed on the moon in the 21st century,--indeed, the first soft landing on the moon since 1976-- when Change\u20193 landed in December 2013. Again, 21st century extraterrestrial soft landings (13) success rate is quite high (appx 85%, with Mars landings accounting for the failures). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landings_on_extraterrestrial_bodies Of course, most of the extraterrestrial landings were sponsored by the United States, ESA and Russia, with China and Japan only more recently achieving soft landings. Thus, these success rates will likely overestimate success rates of less experienced countries (including China, India, and Israel). Nevertheless, they are a good starting point. Next I look at scheduled moon soft landings. Here, China clearly has the lead, as the Change\u20194 successfully launched on December 7, 2018 and entered lunar orbit on December 12. Landing is scheduled for appx. January 3, 2019. No other country is anywhere near launching a lander, with India\u2019s Chandrayaan-2 not scheduled to launch until, ironically, the same day (January 3, 2019). So unless the China mission fails, it must necessarily be the next country to land on the moon. It\u2019s probability of being the next country to successfully land on the moon is thus equal to its probability of success.   In that regard, while a fairly new entrant to space exploration, China has made large investments of resources and national pride in space exploration and their success rate, while hard to gauge given the opacity of the Chinese space program, appears to be increasing. They also have recent successful experience soft landing on the moon. The Chang\u2019e-4 lander is modeled on the successful Chang\u2019e-3 (indeed it was the backup copy for the Chang\u2019e-3). I assumed that the landing parameters with regard to spacecraft functionality were nearly the same, absent some error in manufacturing or programming. In light of this, and with the success to date of the Chang\u2019e-4 mission, I gave the Chinese a 97% probability of success if the mission were identical to Chang\u2019e-3 (I discounted 3% for the remaining uncertainties of deployment and landing).  However, the Chang\u2019e-4 is planned to land on the far side of the moon (the first ever in human space exploration) near its south pole. While the landing itself will be automated like the Chang\u2019e-3, communications with the lander are more complicated and require use of a relay satellite. As a result, the complexity of the landing and communications challenges add a degree of risk not seen in the successful Chang\u2019e-3 landing. I thus added an additional uncertainty risk of 3% to account for this complication. Thus leading to a probability of 94%. Given this high probability, India and Israel became relatively easy to calculate because, given even 100% mission probability, each would only have at most a 6% chance. With India\u2019s launch planned for January 3, 2019, the earliest its lander is expected to touch down on the moon is sometime in February 2019. Delays have hampered the mission to date (over 3 years) and while the orbiter is ready for launch, apparently the lander and rover are still being tested and there is speculation that launch will be delayed even further.  Similarly, Israel\u2019s Sparrow mission (now named Genesis) is scheduled to be launched in February 2019 using a SpaceX Falcon 9 out of Cape Canaveral. Once launched, the spacecraft will slowly increase its orbit for 2.5 months, followed by maneuvers to enter lunar orbit. It will then orbit for 2-4 weeks before attempting landing. Assuming all goes as planned, the earlier Israel will land on the moon is therefore mid-May to early June 2019. It, too, has seen delays and is reliant on the the 3rd party launch platform.  Given the delays and uncertainty of each country\u2019s missions, and without additional information, I also give them equal weight in their success rate of getting there before the other (i.e., 50/50). In addition, given the great uncertainties of mission delay/success, I will leave their mission success probability (at least the probability of successfully landing in 2019) at 50%. As a result,  the probability of India or Israel successfully beating China and either India/Israel is only 1.5% each, which I round to 2% each. The U.S., China and Germany also have moon missions planned for late 2019 and one of those could theoretically land before the end of the year if there are no delays. Launch schedules are often delayed, however, and I assume that would be the case with each of these.

Lunar landing missions are very likely to be successful nowadays, and the Chinese landed an almost-identical set of technology on the moon 5 years ago. So what are the odds that the Chinese mission will fail:succeed?  Let's say 1:10 p(Chang'e-4 lands on the moon in this timeframe) = 0.91 INDIA\nIndia is scheduled to launch their Chandrayaan-2 mission (lander + rover) on 3 Jan.  It is a near-certainty that the mission will go ahead at some point, but some delay is possible in the launch date (depending on weather). I have less confidence in the Indian mission succeeding.  Given India has not previously done a successful moon landing, let's say their odds of failure are double those of the Chinese, or 2:10. p(Chandrarayaan-2 lands on the moon in this timeframe) = 0.83\np(Chang'e-4 fails AND Chandrarayaan-2 succeeds) = 0.07\np(both Chang'e-4 and Chandrarayaan-2 fail) = 0.09*0.17 = 0.02 ISRAEL\nThe Sparrow mission (lander only) is a small private venture, designed to win a SpaceX prize but, when the prize was not won, a decision was made, \"what the heck, let's just see if we can land this thing anyway\".  Due to cost constraints, there are \"virtually no redundant systems\".  As one of the 3 founders of the mission said, \u201cThe spacecraft is going to be the bare minimum of what it takes to get to the moon. We want to show you can do it with a small spacecraft. There are thousands of pieces that have to work perfectly, but in the end you have to cross your fingers and hold your breath. It\u2019s a risky mission. We just couldn\u2019t afford [backup components].\u201d My best guess is that there is a 50:50 probability that, if launched, Sparrow will succeed in a moon landing.  Assuming it launches at all. The timing is a bit unclear too.  While Wikipedia gives a landing date of 13 Feb (based on a July 2018 report), more recent resources give a launch date \"early in 2019\" and a flight time of \"two months\".  (In comparison, a direct flight like Apollo 11, is about 3-4 days; and the Chang'e-4 mission will take about 4-5 weeks). \n In those cases, it is highly likely that Chandrayaan-2 will succeed, or fail, before Sparrow gets to the moon, even if Chandrayaan-2's launch is delayed a couple of times. p(Sparrow lands on the moon in this timeframe) = 0.40\np(Sparrow succeeds AND both Chang'e-4 and Chandrayaan-2 fail) = 0.09*0.17*0.40 = 0.01 OTHERS\nAnd if, by some dumb chance (p=0.01), NONE of these 3 missions succeed, there is a German mission pencilled in for the July-September 2019 window, and Chinese and US missions pencilled in for departure shortly after the deadline for this question. **************************\nSOURCES\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_the_Moon\nhttps://www.space.com/42462-india-successful-rocket-launch-moon-mission.html\nhttps://www.jweekly.com/2018/11/02/south-bay-talk-covers-israels-moon-shot/\nhttps://www.space.com/42665-china-launches-moon-far-side-lander-rover.html  (Thanks @tsaez!)\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html"], [62356, "2018-12-13T22:53:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Waste of time and money"], [52587, "2018-12-13T22:35:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [534, "2018-12-13T22:29:46Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.65], ""], [63254, "2018-12-13T22:20:01Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [46575, "2018-12-13T21:57:55Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.08, 0.02, 0.3], "Based on my reading of the quoted sources and industry knowledge (from a previous career).
