If confirmed, it would be the Chinese leader's first visit to the North Korean capital since he took power in 2012, and 13 years after the last visit by a Chinese President, when Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao visited in 2005. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-is-north-korea-really-willing-to-denuclearize-we-will-soon-find-out/ U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was scheduled to travel to Pyongyang on Sunday, but that trip was suddenly cancelled on Friday by Mr. Trump, who tweeted that he had asked Mr. Pompeo \u201cnot to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d It was Mr. Trump\u2019s first admission that talks with North Korea were not going well. The same day, Mr. Trump tweeted his \u201cwarmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim and I look forward to seeing him soon.\u201d Mr. Trump, apparently, doesn\u2019t blame Mr. Kim for the lack of progress. Then who, in his mind, is responsible? The answer is China. \u201cBecause of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were,\u201d Mr. Trump also tweeted on Friday. He said the Pompeo trip to Pyongyang would be \u201cmost likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved.\u201d So, in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind, the two issues are linked and the trade issue needs to be resolved first. Cancellation of the Pompeo trip now gives more responsibility \u2013 and opportunity \u2013 to two other leaders who are expected to visit Pyongyang next month. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/world/asia/china-north-korea-sanctions.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlock China is less interested in backing the denuclearization efforts because it feels burned by Mr. Trump on trade, according to a Western diplomat with contacts among the Chinese leadership.

Past Politburo members have a tendency to go up for ceremonial events so that the political issues are not the only driver for the \"exchange\" / \"cooperation\" relationship.  Furthermore, China gets back into the game, can push Americans into bending on their current hard line demands to denuclearize before sanctions end (while also saving face), and can strengthen both private and public acknowledgement of their influence on DPRK.

The anniversary is one of the hermit kingdom\u2019s most important annual holidays, along with the birthdays of late leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.  If Xi does go, it will be the first trip to North Korea by a Chinese president since Hu Jintao\u2019s visit in October 2005 and since Pyongyang started conducting nuclear and missile tests in 2006. \n   ...Kim has visited China to meet Xi three times since March \u2013 the first two times in the lead-up to the summit and the third in June to brief China on the outcome of the talks.\n   Liu Ming, from the Centre for Korea Studies at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said North Korea might be trying to use Xi\u2019s presence at the celebrations to suggest the bilateral relationship was back on track.  \u201cNorth Korea would also look weaker if Xi did not visit given that Kim has visited China three times,\u201d Liu said, adding that Xi gave his word that he would go when Kim visited in March.  \u201cChinese leaders often made reciprocal visits in Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il\u2019s time, but not in Kim Jong-un\u2019s. The chance of Xi accepting the invitation is quite high.\u201d\n   ...Cui Zhiying, director of the Korean Peninsula Research Centre at Tongji University in Shanghai, agreed that North Korea might see Xi\u2019s visit as its first step to becoming a normal state.  ...\u201cIf Xi actually visits North Korea, bilateral relations will reach a new stage ... of cooperation. China has always opposed chaos on the Korean peninsula and thus wanted the Kim regime to be stable. This will never change.\u201d https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2154515/trump-says-he-confident-kim-jong-un-will-follow-contract-they\n...While Kim agreed to work toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, which was largely in line with Pyongyang\u2019s stance since 1990s, Trump apparently had a different understanding of what was achieved at the first meeting between North Korea and a sitting US president.  \u201cWe agreed to the denuclearisation of North Korea,\u201d he said in the tweet.  \n   ...\u201cChina, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!\u201d said Trump in the tweet.\n   ...\u201cPresident Trump is clearly telegraphing to the North Koreans that there\u2019s distance between China and the United States \u2026 and the North Koreans are going to use that to their advantage,\u201d said Joel Wit, a senior fellow at the Stimson Centre, a Washington-based think tank, and founder of 38 North, a website focused on North Korea issues.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to constantly play off the US against China, and that doesn\u2019t strengthen our position, it weakens our position with North Korea,\u201d Wit said. https://www.voanews.com/a/china-rebuffs-trump-s-blame-in-north-korea-denuclearization-fallout/4477861.html\n...\u201cThis is totally baseless. China's position on the Korean peninsula is consistent and clear. We will steadfastly play a positive role and make constructive contributions towards pushing for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and peace and stability in the region,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told press briefings repeatedly.\n   Wang Dong, a professor of international studies at Peking University, said China is being scapegoated.\n   \u201cChina can\u2019t afford to be the scapegoat. What happened was the Trump administration is divided on its approach toward the procedures of denuclearization. [Pompeo] proposed a hawkish approach [during negotiations], which Pyongyang will never accept. North Korea has made it clear that its principle of step-by-step and simultaneous action has to be abided by,\u201d Wang said, adding that both Washington and Pyongyang need to make compromises to narrow their gaps.\n   The professor urged Trump not to offset his diplomatic efforts after the Singapore summit, saying he should next persuade his hawkish aides to come up with a feasible approach on \u201cfull denuclearization\u201d \u2014 one that differs from the past complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs.\n    ...While China may be genuinely committed to pushing Pyongyang to denuclearize, it\u2019ll inevitably bear the brunt of any back-and-forth from North Korea\u2019s delivery, according to Tsai Tung-Chieh, a professor of international politics at National Chung Hsing University in Taichung, central Taiwan.\n     That\u2019s because Pyongyang can only look to China, currently its major trade partner, for economic gains in exchange for any progress of its denuclearization, the professor said.  North Korea leader Kim Jung Un has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit Pyongyang in September for National Day celebrations in a bid to strengthen economic ties.\n     ...\u201cDenuclearization will be next used as a bargaining chip and guarantee for North Korea to negotiate for [future] economic incomes. That is, the North won\u2019t terminate nuclear programs without any economic gains,\u201d Tsai said.  After the Singapore summit, Trump may have eroded China\u2019s leverage by directly engaging with Pyongyang, but that doesn\u2019t mean China will be left completely out of the equation, the professor said.\n     ...Wang, in addition, disagreed that Kim is planning on a second summit with Trump in Switzerland as he said such a summit isn\u2019t in the interests of either country.  What Pyongyang really wants is a four-party meeting with South Korea, China and the United States, the professor said.  \u201cPyongyang has more faith in South Korea and China. It remains skeptical of the U.S. To Kim, he will be under a lot of pressure shall he next meet one-on-one with Trump. Instead, he will feel more eased sided by South Korea and China and can certainly leverage the three-to-one advantage to constrain the U.S.\u201d Tsai said. https://borneobulletin.com.bn/chinas-june-trade-with-north-korea-falls-by-more-than-half/\n(AP) China\u2019s imports from North Korea plunged 92.6 per cent in June compared with a year earlier under United Nations (UN) sanctions imposed to stop Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes, the customs agency said yesterday.  Exports of Chinese oil and other goods to the North fell 40.6 per cent, a customs agency spokesman, Huang Songping, said at a news conference. He gave no financial totals.\n     ...China provides nearly all of the isolated North\u2019s trade and energy supplies. Beijing has imposed limits on oil exports and sharply reduced North Korean revenue by banning purchases of its textiles, seafood and coal.  \n     Beijing was long Pyongyang\u2019s diplomatic protector but has supported the UN sanctions out of frustration at what Chinese leaders see as their neighbour\u2019s increasingly reckless behaviour.\n     Beijing also ordered North Korean-owned restaurants and other businesses in China, an important revenue source, to close.\n     In the first six months of the year, Chinese imports fell 88.7 per cent from the same period of 2017 to 690 million yuan (USD103 million), according to Huang. Exports declined 43.1 per cent to 6.4 billion yuan (USD960 million).  Huang said Chinese exports to the North have declined for 11 straight months, while imports have declined for 10 months.\n     Beijing has \u201cconsistently implemented\u201d the UN trade curbs, Huang said.\n     Also yesterday, a deputy Chinese foreign minister sounded a reassuring note about North Korea after Trump complained Beijing might be disrupting diplomatic efforts due to its trade dispute with Washington.  The official, Kong Xuanyou, said there has been \u201cpositive momentum\u201d and Beijing is in \u201cclose coordination\u201d with Washington. https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/china-is-standing-in-the-way-of-north-korea-negotiations/\n      ...But there is an even bigger hurdle faced by the Trump administration. North Korea denuclearizing was always highly unlikely, but any meaningful deal between North Korea and the U.S. that leads to better relations \u2014 even just securing stockpiles and reduced quantities of missiles \u2014 is likely to be hindered by China. For a time, Beijing cooperated with America\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions. But now China is loosening enforcement at the North Korean-Chinese border and granting the Kim regime much-needed access to foreign currency. This strengthens North Korea\u2019s negotiating position against America.\n     ...Under threat of a crackdown on China\u2019s export-machine, Beijing went along with Trump\u2019s maximum pressure plan. But that put China in an awkward position. China became the \u201cbad cop,\u201d imposing tough sanctions, while the United States \u2014 in Trumpian fashion \u2014 was promising to make North Korea rich. China holds the stick, and the U.S. holds the carrot. This situation was, and is, undesirable for China. Because North Korea borders China, it will work against any pivot by North Korea toward the United States.\n     And China has good reason to believe Kim would make a modest pivot if the price were right \u2014 not to being a U.S. ally, of course, but at least away from China and toward the rest of the world \u2014 given the deficiency of trust between China and North Korea. Some of this stems from ancient history.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/south-korea-increases-engagement-with-north-korea.html"], [368, "2018-07-15T19:36:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-07-15T18:57:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.25, 0.71], ""], [12591, "2018-07-15T16:41:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [368, "2018-07-14T21:15:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38616, "2018-07-14T13:58:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.35, 0.63], ""], [368, "2018-07-14T01:30:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [37488, "2018-07-13T04:30:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.88], ""], [368, "2018-07-12T19:17:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-07-12T12:25:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.78], ""], [39937, "2018-07-12T06:09:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [31450, "2018-07-12T03:49:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], "Shifting later due to passage of time."], [172, "2018-07-12T00:34:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [368, "2018-07-11T18:37:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [47812, "2018-07-11T02:22:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.4, 0.58], ""], [368, "2018-07-10T16:25:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [73, "2018-07-10T14:51:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2], ""], [691, "2018-07-09T13:46:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.78], ""], [19801, "2018-07-09T07:27:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [368, "2018-07-09T01:06:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [41707, "2018-07-08T12:30:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [28166, "2018-07-08T02:38:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [368, "2018-07-07T19:40:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1646, "2018-07-07T14:24:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [20156, "2018-07-07T05:46:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.35, 0.64], ""], [172, "2018-07-06T20:57:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [691, "2018-07-06T20:18:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.78], ""], [601, "2018-07-06T15:27:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], "Kim has been going to the mountain rather than the reverse"], [368, "2018-07-05T19:32:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [59713, "2018-07-05T18:33:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [31450, "2018-07-04T19:40:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.65], "Shifting later because there isn't much time left in the current bucket."], [35636, "2018-07-04T06:49:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.09, 0.9], "PoT.

But I think going to North Korea right away is likely to make North Korea / Kim look more important right now than less.  Especially if Trump ends up in Pyongyang), I don't see China following suit.  Nor do I see them rushing off to Pyongyang to beat Trump to the punch; it's not such a significant move for them and is far more likley to make them look weak rather than strong.  Plus they have little to lose from Kim grandstanding since they still hold most of the cards...and much more to gain by expanding diplomatic power in Asia and elsewhere while the Trump and Kim flirt.  And there are a many parties in Asia who would rely more on a rational, steady, slow-to-act, economically-driven power close to home that are being left out by Trump's current US policy and already wondering what the role in in a changing power dynamic in Asia.  China has maintained support for North Korea in its media: suggesting sanctions be lifted (opposing Trump's wait for denuclearization),  through opening air travel to Pyongyang and escorting Kim to Singapore, etc.  They've also been stepping up other diplomatic activities in the region.  I know that Chinese officials said back in May that Xi would probably visit North Korea \"sometime after the summit\" as a reciprocal diplomatic action, but postponing until they're good and ready seems more likely.  Kim on the other hand is likely to make the most of his own international diplomatic activities, even more so if China delays, I would think.  Furthermore, with so much left off the table and pending concrete decisions and actions, there's a much better chance that China can push for talks among many players and further discussions.  It still seems to me that China is unlikely to send anyone so high level to visit until after things are more settled. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/06/12/donald-trump-accepts-kim-jong-uns-invitation-visit-north-korea/\nhttp://www.france24.com/en/20180613-kim-invites-trump-visit-pyongyang-north-hails-radical-switchover\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/10/world/asia/trump-kim-korea-china.html\nhttps://www.axios.com/china-japan-south-korea-trump-kim-summit-singapore-8af1dc01-54be-4ac6-a057-7296c4ae1a2c.html\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2150547/us-secretary-state-mike-pompeo-visit-china-after-north\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/13/c_137251381.htm\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-10/china-russia-solidify-growing-eastern-bloc-as-trump-rattles-g-7\nhttp://www.asiaone.com/asia/kim-jong-uns-air-china-ride-singapore-chinese-premier-li-keqiangs-private-jet-apple-daily\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/13/c_137251031.htm\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2150663/will-us-north-korea-deal-leave-japan-south-korea\nhttps://www.workboat.com/news/government/russia-china-expanding-arctic-maritime-reach/\nhttps://www.firstpost.com/india/narendra-modi-at-sco-meet-trade-defence-ties-with-russia-china-likely-to-eclipse-presence-of-pakistan-4503545.html\nhttps://www.axios.com/china-japan-south-korea-trump-kim-summit-singapore-8af1dc01-54be-4ac6-a057-7296c4ae1a2c.html\nhttps://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180613/p2a/00m/0na/020000c\nhttps://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180613_26/"], [212, "2018-06-13T10:54:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.27, 0.73], ""], [368, "2018-06-12T18:15:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-11T18:28:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-11T13:10:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.3, 0.67], ""], [29680, "2018-06-11T00:20:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [5018, "2018-06-10T22:15:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.35, 0.55], ""], [42214, "2018-06-10T21:15:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], "Adjusting for a Xi visit (rumored) close after the summit in Singapore between the US and NK."], [368, "2018-06-10T15:44:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-09T20:24:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-06-09T16:19:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.35, 0.35], ""], [368, "2018-06-08T18:57:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-08T13:49:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.3, 0.69], ""], [368, "2018-06-07T18:14:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [58193, "2018-06-07T12:29:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-06T19:32:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-05T17:13:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-04T16:33:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-04T11:43:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.32, 0.67], ""], [39937, "2018-06-04T07:16:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.21, 0.78], ""], [368, "2018-06-03T18:33:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [42472, "2018-06-03T17:08:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [691, "2018-06-03T13:00:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.32, 0.67], ""], [35831, "2018-06-03T03:52:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.09, 0.9], ""], [368, "2018-06-02T19:00:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [26467, "2018-06-02T18:54:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-01T19:03:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [601, "2018-06-01T18:25:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.6], ""], [172, "2018-06-01T02:27:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [691, "2018-05-31T18:44:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.33, 0.66], ""], [368, "2018-05-31T16:06:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [31450, "2018-05-30T22:39:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.3, 0.45], "Shifting later due to passage of time."], [368, "2018-05-30T20:00:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-05-30T16:07:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.35, 0.3], ""], [2965, "2018-05-30T14:31:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-05-29T17:07:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [47812, "2018-05-29T05:24:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.29, 0.6, 0.11], ""], [11800, "2018-05-29T05:21:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.02, 0.96], ""], [368, "2018-05-28T23:04:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-05-28T17:45:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.33, 0.66], ""], [368, "2018-05-27T21:27:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [11800, "2018-05-27T18:20:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.15, 0.78], "Looking at the members of the polit bureau committee of 25, \nand specifically looking at their functions, why should one of them go to NK?

If the Trump/Kim meeting does go forward in Singapore, and especially if China ends up being there (thanks @JMR2017 for the link http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/733893), I think there is likely to be a slightly longer delay for a formal visit with more emphasis on phone/other diplomatic communication than formal face-to-face visits from top Chinese officials.  The bigger the stakes now, the less likely I think a formal state visit to be in the near future.  These things also usually take time to plan, and even if something is vaguely in the works now, I think the ultimate certainty of a visit taking place or a time being set depends a great deal on what happens this summer, how talks go and what's discussed, and in the end what's agreed upon.   And that leaves a great deal contingent on something that is either very new and uncharted (actual denuclearization in North Korea and opening of normal diplomatic relations with many other countries) and at the same time very fragile with a strong precedent for falling apart (historically, DPRK has been more likely to delay or cancel talks, not follow through on promises to cooperate with countries that are traditionally \"enemies\" or threats, and even do respond unexpectedly or aggressively).  Add to that the general unpredictability of President Trump and the need for American to come across looking strong and to push aggressively against North Korea in a way that requires them to show force / power in kind to save face and I think the likelihood of things going smoothly to be pretty small. China has a lot to gain from a more stable and economically integrated North Korea, but they don't have a lot to gain from sending high level politicians up to North Korea, looking like they're involved moderately or deeply in what North Korea ends up doing (for good or for bad), and then getting backlash if North Korea goes rogue and disappoints the world.  In fact, I think they have quite a bit to gain from being calm, moderate, friendly and helpful, but not closely connected with the summer activities, at least not in any very public way.  I'm sure they're very involved in managing outcomes behind the scenes.  And a personal visit north is very public and politically significant in China and in the region, I think of declaring good/normal relations, general influence, cooperation, and support.  If things go well this summer, there may be additional meetings or events involving more countries or Asian leadership, very likely China, and that would probably also delay the kind of one-on-one trip north by a Politburo member - possible 1-2 months after any major meetings or discussions from the summer.  If things go badly, I imagine there would be at least 2-3 months before a Politburo member goes north to visit, but depending on how and why things go poorly, there may be just as much reason for China to cancel it's promise to send Xi or someone close to him to North Korea for a reciprocal visit.  In a face-saving culture where the kind of tensions present now make saving face even more important, I think there is a lot working against a visit in the near future even if there is reason to think China will start sending leadership north again after ceasing to do so a few years back.  But I think the earliest it is likely to be August, more likely Oct or November.   Even if things go well, China won't rush up to Pyongyang to sort things out if they can do that in other ways.  China has lots of ways to put pressure on North Korea without a direct visit, and a direct visit in the midst of or soon after diplomatic changes could do more harm than good, with little value for China in the process.  The most likely reason to send a top politician north is to show that all has been settled nicely."], [368, "2018-05-15T20:53:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [32258, "2018-05-15T18:47:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.43, 0.55, 0.02], "http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/will-xi-jinping-join-the-trump-kim-summit-singapore-25815 Rumors circulating that Xi may go to Singapore.

In prep for that, I think the likelihood has changed that China will send a top leader to visit with NK. Part of this has to do with the US and SK breaking; the US-first policy that Trump is driving; the larger world role that Xi has said he would take. There are clearly other reasons to visit but this is a significant change that re-balances the benefit to China to visit with a high level official.

Even when relations seem cool or visits seem to demonstrate issues, they've maintained public amicability and efforts to work together, though less recently.  Visits have increased during special events (Kim Jong Il's end/Kim Jong Un's succession to Chairman of the WPK, National Congress elections in China every 5 years, etc.  In the last several years, visits also seem to come the month *after* major headlines from Korea on nuclear activity, esp. regarding plans for expanding nuclear activity (moreso than in relation to launches or nuclear activity).   I can't see that China's delegations of top political members are primarily ways to manipulate N. Korea, though I imagine the discussions end up leaning that way fairly strongly regardless of what official reports say.  And it seems that Kim Jong Un has been showing signs of resisting China's pressure, and China's support of recent UN resolutions on sanctions seems to support growing distance.  And Xi doesn't seem especially committed to high level visits to NK, maybe because of declining relations (as others have noted and has been in the news, over NK's increased aggressive nuclear testing, assassination of Jang Song Thaek, etc) or just because Xi's vision for aggressive economic expansion has very little room for the kind of martial and political grandstanding Kim Jong Un is seeking and Xi's foreign policy seems much less direct or overtly domineering than his domestic policies.  Even then, Xi is good at waiting and looking for key moments and mechanisms of leverage rather than forcing the situation, I think.   I can see why nuclear talks might increase the likelihood of a visit in the spring, though I guess the real communication would be through less direct means, if for no other reason than Kim doesn't want to look like they're under China's thumb.  Also such high level visits from China seem to come after major decisions, possibly as a means of sorting out what the decision will mean for future relations, and not before or during major decisions out of N. Korea as a means of exerting pressure to act a certain way.  Visits during or near the Olympics seem unlikely to me with everything going on.  And as mwokasch suggested, visits tend to happen in the second half of the year (because of a structural limit to number of annual visits?) http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/606127  I'd guess there's maybe a 30-40% chance of a politburo standing committee member visiting this year, probably during the last half of the year, and most likely not until October or November Other helpful comments & links:\nhttp://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/645253\nhttp://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/820202.html http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/617965\nhttp://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/819640.html http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/667793\nmany many thanks to @Isgold7 for the link to the China-North Korea database of high level visits & analytics\nhttps://beyondparallel.csis.org/china-dprk-high-level-visits-since-1953-2/\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15278612"], [47803, "2018-01-09T03:32:19Z", [0.04, 0.07, 0.07, 0.07, 0.75], ""], [368, "2018-01-08T20:09:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [43406, "2018-01-08T18:53:14Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05, 0.8], ""], [46615, "2018-01-08T14:44:31Z", [0.05, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.05], ""], [691, "2018-01-08T12:56:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.19, 0.77], ""], [47634, "2018-01-08T11:39:32Z", [0.8, 0.18, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "Comment deleted on Jan 08, 2018 11:39AM UTC"], [47634, "2018-01-08T11:38:34Z", [0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39563, "2018-01-08T11:02:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [46958, "2018-01-07T22:39:01Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.3], ""], [47357, "2018-01-07T20:48:35Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.9], "Gut feel."], [47363, "2018-01-07T20:07:20Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.25, 0.2], "China and N Korea are best friends, talks are already done between them, but they will release information around this time frame as u say"], [7694, "2018-01-07T19:10:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-07T18:59:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-07T18:44:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [47161, "2018-01-07T16:26:44Z", [0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [1646, "2018-01-07T14:48:12Z", [0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.15, 0.76], ""], [2965, "2018-01-07T03:36:15Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.06, 0.06, 0.82], "No Politburo level official has been since 2015\nand see dataset at https://beyondparallel.csis.org/china-dprk-high-level-visits-since-1953/\nWhile crowd statistics have increased the possibility of a visit  by a Politburo member before 11-1-2018\nto more than 60%,\nMine is lower for now\nWang-Li FM is not a member of standing committee, no obvious members are candidates\nso I am assessing 6% as tail risk  "], [23006, "2018-01-07T03:20:16Z", [0.0, 0.16, 0.17, 0.16, 0.51], ""], [47005, "2018-01-07T02:40:38Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2], ""], [368, "2018-01-07T02:30:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-07T02:18:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [37349, "2018-01-07T01:08:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [43311, "2018-01-06T20:42:02Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5], ""], [46752, "2018-01-06T19:02:04Z", [0.0, 0.65, 0.15, 0.15, 0.05], "If pre-Olympics talks between NK and SK progress there could be a visit during the Olympics and if that is successful there is a good chance of additional visits later.

Also of note, a girl band that included an ex-girlfriend of Kim Jong un was unceremoniously expelled from China, causing their performances to be cancelled.  Meanwhile, China has repeatedly complained about North Korean soldiers sneaking over the border to rob and kill Chinese citizens.  So I expect that in order to maintain the respect of the public, Xi must tread lightly and circumspectlfully in any relations with this creepy leadership. If even permitting a performance by a girl band linked to Dear Leader was a bridge too far, what about a member of the Standing Committee visiting? Images of red carpet, handshakes, with various grinning North Koreans? Refusal, as always, of Kim Jong Un to meet with any diplomat or world leader whatsoever? How dare any Chinese official think he could be granted an audience with the Great Leader? How humiliating! Dateline 11-17-2017 The highest-level Chinese envoy to North Korea in two years arrived in the country\u2019s capital on Friday to try to improve relations that have soured over Beijing\u2019s tightening of sanctions and expressions of support for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for more pressure on the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program. Song Tao\u2019s official mission is to brief North Korean officials on the outcome of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party congress held last month. He is visiting as President Xi Jinping\u2019s special envoy, according to Chinese and North Korean state media, but no other details about his itinerary or whether he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been announced.  -- https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/high-level-chinese-envoy-heads-to-north-korea-amid-chill/2017/11/16/be6066ae-cb49-11e7-b506-8a10ed11ecf5_story.html"], [41289, "2017-11-18T00:02:27Z", [0.05, 0.34, 0.34, 0.16, 0.11], ""], [1646, "2017-11-17T20:07:28Z", [0.05, 0.27, 0.15, 0.26, 0.27], ""], [691, "2017-11-17T17:11:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.32, 0.5], ""], [41459, "2017-11-17T10:24:02Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.75], "China doesn't want to rock the boat"], [41439, "2017-11-16T20:38:27Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [41270, "2017-11-16T16:45:37Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5], ""], [1646, "2017-11-16T14:52:17Z", [0.14, 0.24, 0.13, 0.24, 0.25], ""], [691, "2017-11-15T22:49:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.32, 0.5], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-china/senior-chinese-diplomat-to-visit-north-korea-as-envoy-of-xi-idUSKBN1DF0DN\nA lovely guy, I'm sure, who treats his momma well and is kind to puppies, but not Standing Committee.
