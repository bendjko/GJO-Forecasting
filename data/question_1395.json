As for the inside view, I see two main drivers: 1. The economy - my strong baseline is for more of the same, neither accelerating nor slowing down too much. This favors the current range of 2%-2.50%. It will take major acceleration or slowdown to drive the yield outside it. (The current weakness seems caused by the new Wuhan virus, but I'd say this is temporary).  2. The outcome of the US presidential election:\n -  A Trump win will send bond yields up as money would flow into the stock market and out of the bond market. Given that the range 2-2.50 is fairly wide, I'd say the 30-yr bond yield will end the year with 70% probability still in the 2-2.50 range and 30% above 2.50.  (This assumes that in the eve of the elections the yield will be close to the mid-point of 2.25%).\n -  A Trump loss will likely do the opposite, driving the yield down. I would assume that the Democratic winner would then send calming messages to the markets.

Rich, and large institutional investors will flee q.e. happening in Europe, and europe probably goes into a recession. Some of that money will flee to bonds.   QE will moderate US bonds. The size of the US budget deficit will cause issues around the witching dates.  The Fed *should* cut rates but I don't know that it will have the brains to recognize.   Capitol will be coming to the US and there is not reason to pay more interest than required. Outlook:  till the end of the Q4:  increasing bond yields.
