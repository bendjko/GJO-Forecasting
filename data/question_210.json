In order to achieve the 1'000 noncombatant civilian rate, the month of December would have to see **404 mass killings**. SATP's data going back to 2003 establish monthly numbers as high as 250-300 btw years 2007-2009.  When the \"over a period of one year or less\" is calculated remains an open question, along w/ whether SATP #s are indeed reliable. Both are EWP calls. However, both are reasonable benchmarks which lead me to my conclusion on a 0% probability. Here is why. 1. From South Asia Terrorism Portal ( SATP) data:\nhttp://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/Pakistan/database/casualties.htm As of 20/11/16 Fatalities in Terrorist Violence in Pakistan are: - ***596 Civilians***\n- vs 940 ( for 2015)\n- 61 for the month of November 2016 2. http://www.earlywarningproject.com/definitions\n\"...We will consider a mass killing to have occurred when the deliberate actions of armed groups, including but not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias, result in the deaths of at least 1,000 noncombatant civilians targeted as part of a specific group, over a period of one year or less. A noncombatant civilian is any person who is not a current member of a formal or irregular military organization and who does not pose an immediate threat to the life, physical safety, or property of other people. The reference to deliberate actionsdistinguishes mass killing from deaths caused by natural disasters, infectious diseases, the accidental killing of civilians during war, or the unanticipated consequences of other government policies. Generally, fatalities will be considered deliberate if they result from actions designed to compel or coerce civilian populations to change their behavior against their will, as long as the perpetrators could have reasonably expected that these actions  would result in widespread death among the affected populations. Examples of such actions include, but are not limited to: mass starvation, deaths resulting from the intentional confiscation or destruction of healthcare supplies, and deaths occurring during forced relocation or forced labor...\""], [1993, "2016-11-27T05:51:23Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-26T13:30:45Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-11-25T15:19:32Z", [0.02], ""], [13377, "2016-11-25T03:31:48Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-24T16:58:28Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-24T14:07:01Z", [0.02], ""], [12591, "2016-11-23T23:45:43Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-23T21:22:50Z", [0.0], ""], [30392, "2016-11-23T17:46:07Z", [0.06], ""], [23117, "2016-11-23T17:14:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-23T14:05:52Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-23T11:39:41Z", [0.0], ""], [484, "2016-11-23T03:23:15Z", [0.0], "Down 5% for passage of time."], [368, "2016-11-22T21:19:55Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-22T20:21:42Z", [0.02], ""], [500, "2016-11-22T20:13:39Z", [0.0], ""], [15196, "2016-11-22T17:50:22Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-22T13:59:15Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-22T13:43:20Z", [0.0], ""], [30392, "2016-11-21T23:28:08Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2016-11-21T23:14:29Z", [0.0], ""], [1262, "2016-11-21T19:32:43Z", [0.01], "updating"], [23500, "2016-11-21T07:43:31Z", [0.01], ""], [12302, "2016-11-21T04:01:43Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-20T13:34:07Z", [0.0], ""], [532, "2016-11-19T23:58:49Z", [0.01], ""], [38, "2016-11-19T23:07:13Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-11-19T20:36:08Z", [0.0], ""], [23117, "2016-11-19T15:31:25Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-19T12:34:06Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-18T19:03:41Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-18T13:13:58Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-18T11:47:09Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-18T11:43:43Z", [0.0], ""], [30336, "2016-11-18T07:42:48Z", [0.85], ""], [1333, "2016-11-17T22:12:43Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-11-17T16:21:07Z", [0.02], ""], [1380, "2016-11-17T08:44:40Z", [0.55], ""], [368, "2016-11-16T22:12:13Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-16T16:40:41Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-16T11:41:49Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-15T21:06:25Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-15T21:01:20Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-15T17:15:05Z", [0.02], ""], [30163, "2016-11-15T09:04:09Z", [0.15], ""], [484, "2016-11-15T04:37:50Z", [0.05], "Up 5% for awhile based on @crowden posts: http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/379789"], [29266, "2016-11-14T22:34:24Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-14T21:30:09Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-14T19:01:25Z", [0.02], ""], [601, "2016-11-14T18:08:40Z", [0.04], ""], [10762, "2016-11-14T10:35:09Z", [0.0], ""], [1669, "2016-11-14T09:28:48Z", [0.04], ""], [14182, "2016-11-14T08:44:25Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-11-13T21:21:03Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-13T18:53:51Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-13T13:33:30Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-12T21:41:42Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-12T19:07:45Z", [0.02], ""], [30163, "2016-11-12T18:57:02Z", [0.35], "Comment deleted on Nov 12, 2016 06:57PM UTC"], [30163, "2016-11-12T15:28:35Z", [0.35], ""], [10759, "2016-11-12T11:36:11Z", [0.0], ""], [4634, "2016-11-12T11:36:02Z", [0.0], ""], [68, "2016-11-12T03:30:47Z", [0.01], "Down from 5% on 2 September, for passage of time."], [368, "2016-11-11T20:10:49Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-11T16:58:49Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-11T16:00:44Z", [0.02], ""], [30175, "2016-11-11T15:11:05Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-11-10T20:14:14Z", [0.0], ""], [30163, "2016-11-10T18:18:39Z", [0.35], "Statistically there have been the lowest number of incidemts since 2008 however Q1 / Q2 have seen increasing fatalities from individual incidents. An upward trend towards sectarian violence is also evident as splinter terrorist groups switch towards more extremist ideologies targeting ethnic and religious minorities. government security forces are at odds with political groups such as MQM with a largely Shia demographic and as such do not offer similar levels of protective security.  Other factors such as increasing access  to Internet across the region amongst well educated but unemployed youth create ideal conditions for self radicalisation towards extremist terrorist groups. Geopolitical tensions between Pakistan and India have also increased along the kashmir line of control and whilst both militaries exchange cross border mortar engagements militant groups outside of governmental control are likely to exasperated the conflict for their own means provoking and over reaction from one or both of the two military border forces."], [691, "2016-11-10T17:09:30Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-09T22:15:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-09T12:33:56Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-11-08T21:36:18Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-08T19:19:59Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-08T14:36:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-07T22:03:53Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-07T20:06:04Z", [0.02], ""], [26762, "2016-11-07T15:11:43Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-11-06T21:18:19Z", [0.0], ""], [29266, "2016-11-06T00:39:02Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-05T19:59:06Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-04T17:55:21Z", [0.0], ""], [14493, "2016-11-04T16:57:10Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-04T10:45:25Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-03T20:27:51Z", [0.0], ""], [4139, "2016-11-03T19:33:25Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-11-03T18:01:44Z", [0.02], ""], [29266, "2016-11-03T10:44:56Z", [0.0], ""], [14777, "2016-11-02T23:21:52Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-02T20:53:00Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-02T14:56:59Z", [0.02], ""], [14421, "2016-11-02T14:32:18Z", [0.01], ""], [23117, "2016-11-02T13:22:09Z", [0.01], ""], [29266, "2016-11-02T12:41:54Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-11-01T18:43:04Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-11-01T14:35:28Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-10-31T20:17:22Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-31T17:09:09Z", [0.02], ""], [484, "2016-10-31T16:20:58Z", [0.0], "(no change) Should we seriously consider the Khan protests possibly triggering a reaction?"], [368, "2016-10-30T22:49:40Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-30T14:21:01Z", [0.02], ""], [1450, "2016-10-30T01:35:29Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2016-10-29T20:42:17Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-29T12:37:18Z", [0.02], ""], [29834, "2016-10-29T09:53:56Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-28T17:41:55Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-28T13:26:33Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-10-27T19:02:31Z", [0.02], ""], [83, "2016-10-27T16:16:05Z", [0.0], ""], [14777, "2016-10-27T15:58:22Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-10-26T21:51:02Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-26T12:23:13Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2016-10-25T19:29:37Z", [0.0], ""], [241, "2016-10-25T17:09:14Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-25T16:08:08Z", [0.02], ""], [21800, "2016-10-25T14:43:10Z", [0.05], ""], [14777, "2016-10-25T12:42:58Z", [0.02], ""], [28414, "2016-10-25T11:12:31Z", [0.0], ""], [14182, "2016-10-25T09:56:45Z", [0.02], "Comment: South Asia Terrorism Portal ( SATP) data on fatalities in terrorist violence in Pakistan THROUGH 23/10/17 show 532 civilians have lost their lives for 2016. For the month of OCTOBER 20 civilians has been registered as fatalities. (1)  Whether the tragic loss of this new terrorist attack resulting in sixty (60) deaths of POLICE CADETS falls within the parameters of a MASS KILLING definition is an open question of interpretation. (3) Early warning projects ( EWP) definition is as follows  \"...We will consider a mass killing to have occurred when the deliberate actions of armed groups, including but not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias, result in the deaths of at least 1,000 noncombatant civilians targeted as part of a specific group, over a period of one year or less...\" (2) On the one hand, LeJ certainly qualifies as an armed group taking deliberate action. On the other hand, the PROCEDURAL / DEFINITIONAL requirement includes, however, the action taken must result in the death of NONCOMBATANT CIVILIANS.  Thus, POLICE CADET trainees are (as grotesque and tragic to the surviving families such a characterization may carry) arguably NOT noncombatant civilians. That is, once taking on such new professional endeavor, these innocent young men are given another level of characterization other than \"noncombatant civilians\" even if they were merely \"trainees\". Moving from a civilian endeavor to a professional endeavor such as training within a police academy to take on new responsibilities carries a higher level of risk such as has occurred.  Thus, it is reasonable the above-mentioned tragedy does NOT fall within the parameters of EWP's mass killing definition. It remains THEIR call. NB: a broader more, common sense definition would include this being defined as a terrorist attack. Leaving EWP to define NONCOMBATANT civilians.    Additionally, ASSUMING the attack \"would qualify\"  under EWP's definition of mass killing, combining to reported October figure of 20 fatalities to an additional 60 ( & MORE from this attack that do not survive their serious injuries) provides a total number of at least 80 potentially rising for October or, for the entire the ENTIRE year to date - 592. Using SATP's data as a primary source, in order to achieve at least 1000 noncombatant civilians deaths of a period of a year or less would require over the next sixty (60) days through 31/12/16,  a total of 408 ADDITIONAL deaths or, a monthly rate of over 200. A monthly figure not seen for 2016 nor 2015. Higher month rates were indeed seen in 2013 and, less so in 2014. NB: SATP's source data. Conclusion: With Christine Lagarde in Pakistan today, PM Sharif is using the visit to talk up his progress on the economy & battle against terrorism. (A). The Army Chief General Raheel Sharif reappointment, extension or replacement coming up on Nawaz Sharif's agenda over the next week to ten days,  certainly is good  reason to follow this area closely. On the other hand, even assuming a BROADER interpretation of EWP's requirements, the remaining BENCHMARK HURDLE rate continues to justify a very low probability rating.

Comment: Death toll from Friday's Pakistan Mosque terrorist attack in the Mohmand Agency north of Peshawar has now risen to 38. (FN1) Early warning projects ( EWP) definition is as follows  \"...We will consider a mass killing to have occurred when the deliberate actions of armed groups, including but not limited to state security forces, rebel armies, and other militias, result in the deaths of at least 1,000 noncombatant civilians targeted as part of a specific group, over a period of one year or less...\" (2) Fatalities in TERRORIST VIOLENCE in Pakistan year to date  according to South Asia Terrorism Portal ( SATP)  shows CIVILIAN FATALITIES at 457 through 11/9/16. (3) EWP reserves the right to make the FINAL call on what constitutes a \"mass killing\" in line the specific # of deaths (>1000) & the time line resolution of this GJ Q 1/1/17. Thus, \"definitional issues\" on what constitutes an inclusion or exclusion  of mass killings btw EWP & SATP statistics., is \"possible\". This consideration noted, however, we now have slightly over 90 days before resolution date.  Definitional  issues aside, EVEN adding the 38 new deaths to the 457 SATP civilian fatalities number ( reliability issue)  provides a year to date TOTAL of 495. NOT one month, pursuant to SATP's monthly statistics shows a number above 126 ( March) for 2016. Therefore, in order to achieve the 1000 or more EWP definition, there must be an AVERAGE RATE more than 150 mass killings per month through resolution date 1/1//17. Or, of course, a one off terrible  \"massacre\" event. Such a SERIES OF EVENTS would constitute a dramatic rise this year and,  vs 2015 #s. It would SIGNAL a RETURN to the average +200 per month #s beginning from 2010 - 2013. (4) CONCLUSION: Pakistan is Pakistan so a more forward looking imaginative UNEXPECTED consequence analysis is necessary.  On the one hand, the #s paint a clear story. A large reduction from historic unstable times. Numbers, however,  are backward looking ! PM Sharif has been heating up the Kashmir controversy again &, will address the issue at the UN in NY this week. So, the facts will continue changing per the geopolitical situation w/in Pakistan, India and, notably PUSH to drive out Afghan refugees from Pakistan borders.(5).
