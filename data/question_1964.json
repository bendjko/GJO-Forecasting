Here's an info dump of what I found this morning. This tweet shows the market is giving 30% odds to CPI inflation above 3% over the next five years: https://twitter.com/MichaelRStrain/status/1374679943267946502?s=19 This tweet points out that's inline with about 2.5% PCE inflation: https://twitter.com/karlbykarlsmith/status/1374682881189109763?s=19 Digging around, I found a chart of the FED's median inflation projections over the next few years, in PCE inflation\n They expect 2.4% PCE inflation Q4 2020 to Q4 2021, and dropping to close to 2% inflation for 2022: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCECTPIMD According to that measure, the FED looks like it's using this PCE measure to judge inflation: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=CigI While the question here is using this CPI measure: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=CigL Here's a good article with information comparing CPI and PCE: https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-trends/2014-economic-trends/et-20140417-pce-and-cpi-inflation-whats-the-difference.aspx Now that I have a little better idea of the different measures being used, there are some things I think worth noting. According to the first tweet, the market last gave 30% chance of CPI inflation over 3% over the next five years from about 2011 to 2013. Looking at the CPI chart, that never happened, inflation peaked briefly above 3% at the the of 2011 and then fell below 2% for the following years. So the market seems like it gets pretty easily spooked (although a 30% chance isn't too large, but it does seem higher than warranted giving the low inflation rates that followed). Next, just eyeballing the PCE and CPI charts, it looks like the PCE is generally about 0.5% lower than CPI, like Karl Smith suggested in the second tweet. So if we add 0.5% to the FED's median projection I linked to that would be 2.9% CPI inflation at the end of this year, and about 2.5% at the end of 2022. Putting all that together, I'm adjusting toward the higher buckets. My previous perception seems to have been biased downward by my incorrect understanding of inflation measures. I was translating the FED's projections and my perception of recent low interest rates straight to CPI with no adjustment, but I should have been adding about 0.5%. Now I'm putting the most weight on 2.7 to 3.1 based on the FED's estimate of 2.9% (2.4% PCE plus 0.5%) with second most on the highest bucket. Previously I was weighting the middle bucket the highest. Monthly annual inflation seems pretty noisy as well, so I'm keeping some probability in the lower buckets until we get closer to September and see what the inflation is looking like."], [25400, "2021-03-24T12:35:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [74903, "2021-03-24T09:14:21Z", [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-03-24T07:39:09Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.12, 0.84], ""], [94872, "2021-03-24T03:52:31Z", [0.03, 0.18, 0.47, 0.21, 0.11], ""], [95992, "2021-03-24T03:10:47Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.2, 0.25], ""], [68386, "2021-03-23T20:21:02Z", [0.04, 0.21, 0.46, 0.23, 0.06], ""], [34959, "2021-03-23T15:22:47Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05], ""], [87744, "2021-03-23T12:58:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3], ""], [1333, "2021-03-22T13:26:30Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.12, 0.85], ""], [90237, "2021-03-22T05:59:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-03-22T03:49:02Z", [0.05, 0.23, 0.47, 0.19, 0.06], ""], [14266, "2021-03-22T03:03:54Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2021-03-21T23:14:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [99922, "2021-03-21T23:11:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [97892, "2021-03-21T22:28:33Z", [0.08, 0.14, 0.34, 0.22, 0.22], ""], [97892, "2021-03-21T22:26:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [28171, "2021-03-21T20:41:54Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.25, 0.1], "After a spike in april / may above 3%, I believe inflation will fall back slightly towards the second part of 2H21 but remain above the Fed's 2% target.

Previously the United States used to cover its debt by having foreigners invest. Japan, China, Russia, the EU, Saudi Arabia. in 2020 the Federal Reserve purchased more treasuries than were newly issued by the US Treasury. This means America covered its debts simply by printing money. this means instead of taking purchasing power from other countries, we have been straight up devaluing the currency. with all of these bailout packages we have been increasing deficit spending, and I expect 2021 to be a similar story where the Federal Reserve ends up having to purchase the lion's share of the treasuries. We are already seeing treasury rates climb in order to attract buyers. If treasury rates climb much more, the FED is going to have to step in and increase their purchases which to oversimplify it means more money printing. Another way to look at it is for every four shipping containers coming in full of goods, we are only sending out about one shipping container right now. And the shipments we are sending out are mostly raw materials, not finished goods. We are like a colony of China.
