It seems to be the same flow of bad news and atrocities that have been seen all year.  Yes, I understand that some people are closely watching the Facebook feed, but I think this is even less reliable than it was during my attempts to monitor \"confirmed deaths\" in the Turkey vs PKK question by daily reviews of reported deaths in the media. Over the last 11 months, each of the 5 categories have had 2 hits each, except for 800-900 which has had 3.   As alternative take, split the deaths per month this year into bands of 50 (750-800, 800-850, ... and so on up to 1000-1050).  There have been 1 or 2 hits for each band ... and one outlier in the 1100-1150 band. In short, it seems like a reasonably random distribution between the range of 750 to 1050 deaths per month, without a classic Gaussian curve at the middle of the distribution.  (Stochastic indeed, @wdizard !) On that basis, I'd toss the odds for the 5 answers at 1:2:1:1:1, which roughly translates to 17% : 34% : 17% : 17% : 17%. I'll modify that a bit to:\n(a)  shape a more typical curve, and\n(b) defer a little to the (very strong, perhaps reasonable) crowd preference for the lower end of the projections.
