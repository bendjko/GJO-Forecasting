Iran will not risk additional economic sanctions in order to keep IAEA inspectors out of the facilities.  However, Iran has a history of skirting the rules and this has extended to the JCPOA. The government in Tehran, especially driven by hard-line conservatives and the military, continue to seek to showcase Iranian military power abroad. This has especially been true of the continued development of Iran's ballistic missile program. It is not inconceivable that Iran would attempt to block access to certain sites, especially if those sites have a nexus to Iran's military programs. Overall, this remains a very unlikely scenario as the government looks to rebound from the recent string of protests and a still sluggish economy.

The JCPOA provides significant authorities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors - the key is that they be interpreted expansively and applied aggressively. On this issue, the problem does not lie with Iran. Iranian officials have insisted that military sites are off-limits to inspectors. However, until Iran actually refuses a request for such access, this is mere posturing. And should such a request actually be refused, few would dispute an American contention that Iran had violated the nuclear accord. More worrisome is that such a request will never be made, either due to insufficient intelligence, or because Iran's bluster deters nuclear inspectors from requesting access to suspicious sites, or leads them to bend over backwards to help Iranian officials save face.\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-iran-nuclear-comment-44c41aba-0b55-11e8-8890-372e2047c935-20180206-story.html I don't care if Iran gets nuclear weapons and won't support the USA or EU in any sanctions.

This alone makes it unlikely for a dispute to arise. But we must also consider that Iran currently doesn't engage in sensitive nuclear activities about which misunderstandings or disputes could arise. Indeed, the Trump Administration is invoking the fact that Iran will be allowed to resume some of the more sensitive nuclear work in 2025 and some more in 2030, without making it clear that this is under strict supervision.

The comprehensive historic report the IAEA came out with I think in December of 2015 stated that there was no evidence that Iran had ever attempted to get a nuclear weapon or build a nuclear weapon.

Except for one month where Iran had too much heavy water because the US refused to buy it like they agreed to, Iran has been completely in compliance with the treaty. The only reason why there would be a contested site is if Trump is looking for a reason for a conflict, but I think it's just as likely that Trump would pull us out of the treaty altogether. I believe any contested site would be a false flag accusation. The last few decades has had scores of those. While I do think it is likely the US will go to war soon in order to distract the public and because the powers-that-be believe it stimulates the economy, I think it is more likely to be with North Korea or Russia or Venezuela. We invaded Iraq shortly after Iraq decided to no longer sell oil in dollars, and now that Venezuela has done the same I think they are the most likely target.

Leaving such an important deal for US safety seems reckless, even for Trump, so I would put the chance of leaving the nuclear deal at 7%. The chance of renegotiating the Iranian nuclear deal within the seems considerably higher as it allows for Trump to hit home his nationalist credentials without severely risking Iran gaining nuclear weapons. This could trigger a Iran to block IAEA access during renegotiation to show strength - I give this a chance of 1%. \nChance of Trump referring to the joint commission because IAEA not allowed access to certain military facilities, assuming deal isn't broken - 2% \nIran blocking IAEA access otherwise could be because 1. They are breaking the nuclear agreement with hope to build nuclear weapons 2. They want to agitate US or show strength to Middle Eastern rivals. Point 1 is very unlikely as Iran would have very little to gain from developing nuclear weapons due to US deterrence as seen by the Iraq war (caused by blocked access to UN inspectors) and Trump's tough talk on North Korea. Chance of point 1 is <1%. Point 2 seems credible, especially given heating up conflict with Saudi Arabia with the Qatari blockade, Yemen and Syrian civil wars. However, it comes with great risks of costly retaliation and sanctions that forced Iran into the nuclear deal in the first place.

Note that IAEA does not have blanket permission to visit any of the previously identified (nor any new) nuke research/enrichment sites designated as \"military\" by Iran.  This would only be allowed under the \"additional protocol\", which Iran has never signed but the IAEA claims is in effect.   Currently, the must seek Iran's permission to visit the site, and have \"evidence\" supporting the reasons for the proposed visit to a military site . Of course, how does one get \"evidence\" without access  (usually only through an accident that releases detectible radiation, construction of an identifiable structure- not likely for research/enrichment conducted underground, or through espionage/inside information).   In the latter case (info gathered through espionage or via Iranian sources), revealing this info to the IAEA is usually not the initial course of events (even less so for this Trump admin). There have been calls to re-visit Parchin and fully explore Iran's military activities re: nukes and ICBMs (http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2017/sep/11/report-iran%E2%80%99s-military-sites-and-nuclear-deal), and the status of Iran's former militarization of nuke tech remains an open issue with the IAEA (meant to be resolved by 15 October, though not likely).     Iran is on record saying that, as Parchin has already been visited (prior to Iran deal),  there is no reason to open that issue again, and more recently, that all military sites are off limits. The Trump admin could use the Parchin issue to create a dispute that is elevated to the Joint Commission, but first they would have to get the IAEA to agree that there is a need to request access to Parchin or another military site (they may not).   This process would take months, probably not start until the 15 October date has been passed and require lobbying of allies plus the IAEA (something the Trump admin is not staffed for, and something his current rhetoric on the Iran deal makes difficult).   Of course, there is some probability that the Trump admin will go down this route, get the IAEA to request access (and be denied) during Q1 of 2018 and get a dispute elevated to the Joint comission by Q2 of 2018.   The concerns about Parchin are certainly valid. However, it seems much more likely that the Trump admin will simply dispense with the Iran deal by early 2018, making cooperation with the IAEA and allies on this issue moot.
