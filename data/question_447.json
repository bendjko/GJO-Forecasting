similar to a worn torn African nation that has suffered from genocide or is about to suffer from genocide.  The Rohingya ethnic group in Myanmar is at risk to commit or be a victim to genocide.  They live within the nation's borders, but are considered less than full citizens and inferior to ethnic groups in other areas of the country.  Almost every possible war crime was committed by the previous regime and there are leftover child soldiers throughout the state.  Myanmar is the Earth's second leading exporter of opium and amphetamine production is rising.  Drug use can be a major factor in genocide, as well.

On Sunday, April 9, elections were held for a parliamentary seat left vacant in the main city of Srinagar after a lawmaker resigned in protest against last summer\u2019s killings. A majority stayed away, with only 7 percent turning up to vote. Young Kashmiris \u2014 fed up, brutalized, growing up in the most densely militarized zone in the world \u2014 surrounded polling stations to protest Indian rule. Some protesters threw stones at the polling booths and the troops stationed there. The troops responded as they do, with shooting, beating and blinding protesters and bystanders alike. Eight people were shot dead. Among those killed was 12-year-old schoolboy, Faizan Fayaz Dar, who was shot in the back of his head, the BBC reported from his village. Dirges rang from Kashmiri homes and graveyards. We have seen this before, like a tragic war film on a loop: young corpses floating on the shoulders of families and friends for that ultimate journey. Last year, during a four-month siege, nearly 100 people were killed and hundreds blinded, as Indian paramilitaries rained bullets and millions of buckshot pellets on protesting crowds. Now the response of the Indian state has turned even more ferocious. By the end of the week, three more youths had been killed, including a 17-year-old street vendor whose forehead was cracked open with a bullet. A college campus was raided by paramilitaries in full military gear, accompanied by an armored vehicle, injuring around 50 students. Earlier in the week, as the Indian Army was patrolling central Kashmir, soldiers chanced upon Farooq Ahmad Dar, a 26-year-old shawl weaver, who was returning home from a funeral prayer. As an artisan, Mr. Ahmad works with his hands, making filigree-like embroidery on \u201ccashmere\u201d shawls. The soldiers assaulted him, wounding his hands and arms. After the assault, the soldiers tied him up to the front of a jeep, strapped on a handwritten placard and paraded him through several villages for hours as a live trophy \u2014 a \u201chuman shield\u201d at the front of an armed posse (para. 1-7).
