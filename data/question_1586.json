There is some wrong data in my original forecast [1] (mainly the % of business travelers is way off, I figured it to be ~45% but it's more like ~8%) but I don't have time to really think about it hard right now. I had given June 5% as fully half of the top ~15 days ever for TSA screenings had been in mid to late June [2,3] (numbers a bit inconsistent between those two, e.g. 28 June 2019 shows up in one but not the other). This is in all likelihood due to vacation travel once the school year ends. Since a lot of schools simply shut down for the year, the coordination effect was gone, but I figured a small chance due to force of habit. But now we have numbers through 21 June [4] and we have not broken 600k. We *have* seen a big increase, but it just seems impossible that we'd break 2M in the coming week. Cutting the 5% by half since about half the vacation-travel opportunities are gone, and half again because a 3-4x jump is unlikely so soon: so 1%. For July, 5 of the ~15 biggest travel days have been in July [2,3] but I believe we can discount July 4th (2 days, as most do a round trip) as it is too soon, I doubt we will see 3-4x jump in the next 2 weeks either. The other 3 of those 5 are ascribed to \"summer travel\". Are these return trips for the outbound trips in late June? If so, since the latter didn't happen, the former will not happen either. But why is there such coordination? It could be an uptick due to international travel, maybe school years abroad end in July? But if so, that is definitely not coming back in July. Idk, let's just reduce it to 3%. Going the other way, when I made my first forecast on this Q, we were at ~100k/day, and many of the forecasts sounded very apocalyptic, like maybe it would take YEARS to get back to 2M. But, in just 2 short months, we're up from ~100k/day to ~500k/day, I don't think a lot of people saw that coming (myself included). Others predicted the recovery would be about as quick as the downfall, but eyeballing the table at [4], the downfall was by ~20x in about a month, and the recovery (not even counting the long plateau at the bottom) has been ~5x in ~2 months. So I will up August by a little bit, from 10% to 12%.

So many aspects to it. 1. According to the TSA page, 1y ago we had ~2.3M travelers screened every day. But where were they going and coming from? International travel restrictions will probably recover more slowly. There are travel bans / restrictions to remove, international travel takes longer (hence riskier), and it is more expensive (and people have lost jobs and income). So it matters what % of previous TSA screens were international. Similarly, several US states have travel restrictions and self-quarantine requirements (20 by a rough count [1]); so it matters how many were coming and going to/from each state. The info on % of international screens was easier to find that I anticipated; ~23% of all passengers were international in 2019 [2]. 2. The TSA page only has info since 1 March 2020, and the info from 1y ago for the same period. But travel is heavily seasonal. Lots of people travel during (northern) summer. Currently the highest day visible on the TSA page is 2.6M, in mid-March 2019. But what was the highest number in summer 2019? Was it ~3M? Or 10M? This matters as the forecast must incorporate a baseline as well as a prediction of how the pandemic will evolve. Well, as it turns out, TSA screens are much more stable, and travel much less seasonal, than I had guessed: the top day in history was ~2.8M, just ~20% above the average of 2.3M [3]. On reflection, vacation travel is seasonal, but it probably offsets, not adds to, business travel. 3. Even after all lockdown ends, how long does it take for people to go back to previous levels of activity? The most braindead approach I can think of is to assume the recovery takes the same amount of time as the crash. Right now that would mean 41 days (after lockdown ends). Psychological factors that are hard to guess come in. What % of people will be eager to travel again? What % will take some time to enjoy their locality anew, before wanting to travel? Some polls: over 80% of Americans approve of the lockdowns, in the many ways you might ask that question [4]. About 60% are worried the US will remove lockdown too quickly [5]. For business travel: some businesses (what %?) have had to adapt to remote work, so demand will probably lessen compared to pre-corona. And across the board, *making* travel plans is substantially more complex than cancelling them, which argues for recovery being slower than crash. 4. It's all but certain that we won't have a vaccine before September. Hence resurgences of the virus will remain a concern. This creates a negative feedback loop for this question: even if we go back to (say) 1M travelers per day, that would probably lead to the virus spreading again, which would lead to another round of lockdowns, fewer people traveling, etc. Getting more quantitative... 1. The pre-coronavirus baseline is 2.3M/day; 2M is 87% of that\n2. Big travel days before 1 Sep 2020 are:\n....2a. Memorial weekend (25 May 2020), 2M is 72% of 2019 memorial weekend\n....2b. A whole week in late June (school vacation?); 2M is ~75% of each of those\n....2c. July 4th weekend? Doesn't appear in [3] but let's guess 2M is ~75% of that too\n3. With the DoS level 4 global travel advisory, and all the uncertainties worldwide, I'm pretty sure international travel will not go back to half or more what it was, before 1 Sep 2020. So I claim >11% of the travel on a normal day is gone for the remainder of the question. More for the earlier periods.\n4. The coordination effect of everybody travelling after the last week of school is gone, since schools have closed. So we will not see a bump nearly as pronounced around those dates as last year. The coordination effect of July 4th will still be there, as well as memorial day. However, I predict that some sizeable % of people will actively avoid crowded airports, and shift travel dates around.\n5. Most international travel into the US is Mexico + Canada. US/Canada border closure has been extended until 20 May, and \"undoubtedly longer\" [6].\n6. The fraction of business trips is ~45%: 463.6M [7] divided by 1.013B [2] in 2018. Lotta words, but what about an actual forecast? Here is my tentative timeline... MAY: Lots of places are already scheduled to be in lockdown for at least half of May. Travel will be < 50% baseline for sure. Memorial Day is too soon. Most of the 20 states with quarantine requirements will still have them, and will actively discourage travel into them on Memorial Day.\nJUNE: International travel still more than 2/3 gone for sure. And business trips still down at least 50% for sure. People who travel on business are generally wealthier and less likely to be forced into risky situations. Let's say a 5% chance here that somehow one of the school-end bumps pushes us over 2M, as that is over 2 months away.\nJULY: International travel still more than 1/2 gone. Business trips still down at least 25%. Let's say 5% chance the 4th of July pushes this over 2M.\nAUGUST: International and business travel still below 3/4 of pre-coronavirus for sure. I don't think there are big domestic travel events in August. So give this 10% as it is further away.

Politically, there are motivations in the US for things to go back to normal sooner, so this may be forced up a bit... but I don't think it will bring completely normal travel back.

I could not find the exact number of TSA checkpoint travel numbers for July and August, but I estimate them to be about 2.7 million. This means if there is only a 25% reduction in the number of flights due to COVID-19 that would get them past the 2 million mark. In addition, it doesn't have to consistently beat 2 million, and it fluctuates by plus or minus 200,000, so if the average per day got up to 1.8 million, there would probably be a day with more than 2 million checks, so a 33% or lower reduction in flights would probably be enough. A second thing we have to consider is a lot of travelers book in advance, so the number of flights probably won't recover until well after the pandemic is over. Looking at COVID-19 forecasts it is almost certain that it will still be a problem by June 1, so we can rule out the possibility of having 2 million before then. This means that June 2020 is also unlikely. The forecasts also show that it will be a problem in July; however, I don't think the forecasts are very accurate going out that far.

There is some hope of things getting back to normal by August, but it still doesn't seem that likely. Also, there are lag effects like I said, so it needs to be better by the beginning of August.
