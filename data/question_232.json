Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi attempted to capitalize on the Arab Spring through the formal elections process of Iran, as well as publicly speaking out against the ruling party.  The Islamic Republic of Iran, as the leaders refer to their state, is a dangerous place for any person to speak out against the governing body.  Iranian citizens and foreigners are usually executed or imprisoned for life if they speak out against the government or its leaders.  Mousavi and Karroubi are publicly known and can be used as bargaining chips in the future.  Keeping them alive and communicating to the outside world may be Iran's presentation of human rights.  Iranian allies, such as Russia and Syria, could also use Mousavi or Karroubi as bargaining chips.  I predict the two gentlemen will stay in house arrest for a very long time past June 1, 2017.
