The original question was placed in case both Presidential Candidates tied. Congress would then vote for the President to break the tie.   There was not a tie.  In order for this question to resolve as yes at this point, one of two things has to happen.   Either the Supreme Court has to throw out the votes of several states, or Congress must agree to throw out the votes of several states. This would give neither candidate a majority of the vote.   The supreme court refused to accept the case from Texas. It has been refiled, but the earlier refusal makes it highly unlikely. Even if they were to accept the case, the political process is written in the constitution and it is unlikely they would do anything other than state that this must be resolved in Congress.  To refuse to accept votes from a state requires both the House of Representatives AND the Senate to concur.  If both do not agree, the electoral college votes stand and they do not need to vote. So both Senate and House would have to agree to throw out the votes of several states. The House has a majority of Democrats, currently the Senate has a majority of the Republican Party.   My projection of either event happening is zero. Your projection should factor in your perception of these events occurring.

(Full disclosure:  I was for Hayes, but only because we were in school together.) Under the current dispensation, the House votes by states and not individuals.  The Rs currently control 26 state delegations, but one of them is Alaska, a one-member Republican delegation that seems vulnerable at the moment.  (D.C. has electoral votes but is not a state and so has no standing to vote on this.)  There are other one-seaters, but they all seem pretty secure.  So if that one seat changes, the House goes to 25-25.  The Constitution has nothing to say about this situation.  There are a couple of other closely divided House delegations that could either eliminate or exacerbate this outcome. And here we are once again lamenting the lack of care taken by the writers of these questions.   The House may vote any number of times before 21 January and be unable to select a Lucky Winner.  So does the question ask whether the House votes, or whether the House actually decides?  My guess is the GJedi meant to ask the latter question, but they didn't. Fun fact:  The Senate, voting by individuals, selects the VP if the electoral collegians can't get it sorted.  So whichever party wins the Senate could name a VP from a party that the ultimately successful Prez does not belong to.  I think Thomas Jefferson was the last President to suffer this indignity, after which the 12th Amendment was supposed to render it impossible.  Nice try, fellas.
