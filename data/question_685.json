The next benchmark will be President Mahmoud Abbas\u2019 first visit to Gaza in ten years sometime this month. Abbas is due to participate in discussions on how once dueling factions, Hamas and Fatah, will unite under a single banner\u2014and to steer a process for elections. Despite the planned trip, skepticism is fomenting in the streets. No date has been announced for the historic visit . . .  Even so there are a few clues that this reporter found that shows the trip, and reconciliation more broadly, are still inching forward: The governor of North Gaza Salah Abu Warda told Mondoweiss: \u201cRenovating Abbas\u2019 house in Gaza has already started, as a prelude to his visit to Gaza.\u201d There is a lot at stake for Palestinians in Gaza. Chief among their concerns are how the detente will put an end to a humanitarian crisis across the strip, spurred over the summer at a time of widening disputes between Palestinian factions and austere economic measures from Ramallah. Add to that the loss of Qatar as a major benefactor, and Gaza is left running on just four hours of electricity a day. Sewage now dumps into the sea, beaches are putrid, and swimming poses a serious risk to health (even death). The prospects of resolving these issues heightened support for reconciliation in Gaza even before the terms of the agreement were known. When Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah stopped in Gaza in October before the marathon meetings with Hamas officials, he was unexpectedly greeted by warm crowds. People were eager for a change, any change. Optimism in Gaza also ran up to the top brass of Hamas\u2019 political leadership. Political bureau member Salah al-Bardawil told Mondoweiss days before the reconciliation deal was signed, \u201cHamas\u2019 decision for national reconciliation is a strategic decision. All Hamas members will be following the leaders to actualize reconciliation and end political divisions.\u201d As early as September, high-ranking Hamas officials began prepping the local population for some form of coming unity government with the West Bank. Yahya Sinwar, head of Hamas, who was voted into the position earlier this year by a party leadership council, was the most vocal senior leader in the lead up to reconciliation. Two days before Rami Hamdallah arrived in Gaza in September, Sinwar met with Palestinian youth, intellectuals and media at the al-Commodore Hotel in Gaza to expatiate on the benefits of making concessions to the Palestinian Authority. He talked for four hours. Sinwar opened the floor for an unusually candid discussion. In the first round of queries he was asked around 25 questions ranging from the deterioration of the Palestinian cause, to Hamas\u2019 mistakes in the government over the previous years, to how Hamas perceives the humanitarian and social realities that Palestinians in the strip endure. I asked Sinwar about what Hamas would do if reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority fails. He indicated that signing a deal with Ramallah was essential to keeping Hamas in power in the long-term. \u201cIf reconciliation talks fail, Hamas will withdraw from the scene,\u201d he replied. Other statements Sinwar said pointed to the fear that if reconciliation collapses, Gaza would plunge into another war with Israel similar to events that led up to the 2014 war. Sinwar showed awareness that there are local opposition factions who are waiting to capitalize off of the power vacuum Hamas\u2019 demise would create. Sinwar assured that Hamas does not seek war, but at the same time he said that al-Qassam Brigades is ready for any coming conflict; he warned: \u201cAl-Qassam Brigades can fire [the same number of rockets] on Tel Aviv in 51 minutes as it fired in 51 days [in 2014],\u201d At one point, Sinwar threatened anyone who opposed reconciliation: \u201cI, with a crowd of youth, will break the neck of anyone who does not want reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.\u201d Reconciliation efforts, he said, are supported heavily by Mohammed al-Deif the leader of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades. To this, the attendees clapped. The room was full of acclamation. Compromise with leaders in Ramallah is not new ideology for Sinwar, who served 22 years in an Israeli prison before being released during the 2011 Shalit prisoner exchange. Sinwar is regarded as being instrumental to that deal. Once back in Gaza, he supported the 2014 National Consensus Government. It is not surprising then that Sinwar told the audience he was prepared to make major concessions to the Palestinian Authority for the sake of achieving a breakthrough. \u201cThere will be sudden concessions [from] everyone at the national level,\u201d he said. Observers in Gaza have talked about these concessions as a way to trade war for peace. Political analyst Abdel Sattar Qassem, a professor of political science at Nablus\u2019 An-Najah National University, said that reconciliation will succeed in the long-run: \u201cThere are valuable regional parties seeking to actualize reconciliation as a means to achieve their self-interests, which will lead to the \u2018deal of the century\u2019 that the Egyptian president [Abdel Fattah] al-Sisi talked about,\u201d he said, referring to Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to broker a broad Middle East peace plan that would include Egypt, Israel and the Palestinians among others. Others pointed to changing alliances in the region as a driving factor. Naji Shurrab, a lecturer at al-Azhar University, added, \u201cHamas found itself alone after it became obvious that Arab countries tried to normalize the existence of Israel in the region. This is why they asked for Egypt\u2019s help.\u201d \u201cBesides, Hamas is not intending to lose its way with Egypt, especially since Egypt is a gatekeeper to the regional and international world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reconciliation failed this time, the living conditions in Gaza will become worse and worse,\u201d he concluded. Analyst Zulfikar Sawirjo, a member of the central committee in the Palestinian Public Front in Gaza, agreed that Egypt\u2019s involvement in the agreement lends legitimacy. \u201cPalestinian reconciliation became a Palestinian, Arab, and regional priority. Large Arab and international parties have now an interest in ending the conflict. The interest of ending the conflict is now common, this is why I believe it will work this time.\u201d Sawirjo clarified that there is also a common internal Palestinian interest in achieving reconciliation. Without Hamas and Gaza, Mahmoud Abbas can never fully advocate on behalf of Palestine at the United Nations or negotiate with Israel. And for Hamas, its only avenue to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip is through Ramallah. Hussam al-Dajany, a political analyst and lecturer in al-Umma University, had a less optimistic view. Touching on one of the most controversial aspects of reconciliation, weapons\u2014and who will have access to them in Gaza\u2014al-Dajany said, \u201cIf Hamas\u2019 resistance weapons are unbridled, Israel will not stay silent for long. They\u2019ll destroy everything and we\u2019ll return to the starting point again.\u201d \u201cWe still have talks, not actual practices. When practices start, we\u2019ll see what will happen,\u201d he concluded. The reconciliation agreement outlined a framework for moving administrative authority in Gaza under the fold of the Palestinian Authority, by re-establishing the National Consensus Government, a short lived-power sharing body first established in 2014. In advance of the detente between Hamas and Fatah, Gazans hope that at the top of the agenda would be finding a solution for the lack of electricity and devastating consequences to health to the 1.8 million Palestinians in the besieged strip. Yet Gazans found themselves disappointed when this did not make it to the agenda. Abbas alluded to solving Gaza\u2019s financial crisis even before the reconciliation deal was signed at the beginning of October in an interview with the CBC\u2019s Mays al-Hadidi. When speaking of public funds earmarked for Gaza that the Palestinian Authority froze, he said the money would be transferred if there was a change of local power. \u201cThe returning of this part [of the budget] will come when the government is able to restore all of its functions in Gaza, but I am not rushing things because this effort needs  time and work,\u201d Abbas said. Some officials in Gaza warn without practical improvements to the daily lives of Palestinians, people will grow frustrated. Many had hoped ending the electricity crisis would be a first step in bridging the political divide, yet it was left off of the agenda. \u201cThe delay of announcing the end of those punitive measures during the consensus government statement weakened the optimism of the people,\u201d Hamas legislator Yahya Moussa told Mondoweiss after the reconciliation agreement was signed. \u201cLifting those measures represents the minimum requirements of the [national] consensus government.\u201d Speaking in Ramallah mid-October Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who heads the National Consensus Government, addressed this point when he said, \u201cDo not expect that the problems of 11 years of division will end in days.\u201d On the table for discussion are how Gaza\u2019s Hamas 45,000 public employees will come under the fold of the National Consensus Government, a sort of unity leadership council comprised of government ministers from both Hamas and Fatah. How these employees will be paid is one of the more complicated issues of the deal, but officials from both Fatah and Hamas have agreed getting the employees paid is a priority. A spokesperson for Fatah, Fayez Abu Aita, told Sama News that the Palestinian Authority will pay Hamas\u2019 appointed public employees for the month of November in December, and then find a comprehensive solution for who will pay the employees by February 2018. While Hamas\u2019 Salah al-Bardawil told me a slightly different account of the arrangement: Hamas and Fatah will each pay two months of the salaries over the next four months.  Back in October, senior member of Fatah Mohammed Shatayyeh underscored, \u201cPeople should be reassured that everyone who works will receive a salary and those who do not want to work will not receive the salary. Basically, we will not pay any old person on the street,\u201d he added. Just before reconciliation kicked off, Gaza suffered a series of economic blows that was tangled up in punitive measures from Ramallah. The Palestinian Authority slashed salaries of Gaza\u2019s public employees. Additionally, the agreement stipulates the Gaza Strip will build up its police force with 3,000 more officers from the West Bank. With most of the fine print incomplete, at the moment reconciliation is in a transitional stage where most of the fallout is occurring inside of Gaza. Merging government ministries between the two geographically separated and occupied Palestinian territories has started, but is far from over. During Abbas\u2019 upcoming visit, another major agreement could be signed, a formal \u201cend of division\u201d document between Gaza-based Hamas and West Bank-based Fatah. This would make an official close of hostilities that erupted in 2007 where the West Bank and Gaza were separated through a two-month bloody struggle for power in Gaza that ended in competing governments. The Abbas visit is also expected to coincide with meetings on establishing elections. Palestinians have not held presidential or legislative elections in over a decade. Reportedly, Hamas is simultaneously seeking to join the PLO (the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which is the Palestinian representative to the international community). The PLO controls all Palestinian diplomatic affairs and has the sole authority to sign binding peace agreements with Israel, participate in United Nations agencies and make declarations of war.    \u201cAll factions needs to be part of PLO and adopt one program,\u201d Hamas legislator Khalil al-Hayya told Mondoweiss, \u201cIn regard to peace and war, we need a united decision and this can\u2019t be achieved as long as we\u2019re not functioning as one government that represents all of us.\u201d After the reconciliation deal with signed, Yahya Sinwar called for another meeting with influential Palestinian youth, intellectuals, politicians, party heads, and journalists. At least 300 showed up this time to the October 19 event at the Chalets Hall in Gaza. Sinwar stressed all of the points he raised in that first meeting where he received a round of applause in anticipation of the deal. With the agreement now inked, he described the Cairo talks as \u201cdifficult.\u201d His most important statement was commenting on Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s description of the reconciliation as \u201cfaux reconciliations\u201d because neither Fatah or Hamas bothered to recognize Israel in this document (a statement Netanyahu made while speaking in a West Bank settlement). Addressing the Israeli Prime Minister, Sinwar took a harsher tone that walked back some of the pragmatism in the new Hamas Charter he supported a few months before: \u201cNo one can force any conditions on us. Reconciliation is a Palestinian issue and no one can interfere with it.\u201d \u201cWe have passed the stage of discussing the idea of recognizing Israel. Now we are not discussing recognizing Israel, but destroying it and when that will happen,\u201d he said."], [11742, "2017-11-29T04:21:24Z", [0.07], ""], [11742, "2017-11-29T04:17:51Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-29T03:04:20Z", [0.0], ""], [30354, "2017-11-28T21:18:03Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-28T20:47:59Z", [0.0], ""], [61, "2017-11-28T15:42:05Z", [0.0], ""], [41681, "2017-11-28T14:50:02Z", [0.03], ""], [41911, "2017-11-28T14:02:46Z", [0.0], ""], [41881, "2017-11-28T09:00:19Z", [0.16], ""], [1034, "2017-11-28T07:31:12Z", [0.0], ""], [41523, "2017-11-28T03:41:05Z", [0.03], ""], [41870, "2017-11-28T02:12:22Z", [0.4], "I could visit the Gaza strip but I think that Israel could forbid him to visit Gaza ."], [37379, "2017-11-28T01:49:07Z", [0.03], "http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/fatah-disarmament-hamas-dialogue-table-171127202933064.html"], [41859, "2017-11-27T23:08:06Z", [0.0], ""], [41851, "2017-11-27T22:25:23Z", [0.0], ""], [29646, "2017-11-27T21:29:08Z", [0.0], ""], [41812, "2017-11-27T21:27:53Z", [0.01], ""], [41801, "2017-11-27T21:03:32Z", [0.0], ""], [41796, "2017-11-27T19:36:43Z", [0.0], ""], [41783, "2017-11-27T19:07:33Z", [0.0], ""], [41583, "2017-11-27T18:40:40Z", [0.85], "Significant progress with Fatah; Abbas admin indicates visit- must build on relationship and demonstrate seriousness of commitment"], [41756, "2017-11-27T18:23:41Z", [0.3], ""], [37183, "2017-11-27T15:17:28Z", [0.02], ""], [31275, "2017-11-27T14:14:09Z", [0.03], "PA controls only 5% of Gaza.

Why does this mean something for Abbas, and why is my take on that something to drop to 0%? The Harari  situation has to do with Iran's outsized presence in Lebanon, primarily in the form of Hezbollah. Crown Prince MBS of Saudi Arabia is waging war by proxy against Iran in Yemen, and threatening to wage war by proxy against Lebanon. Meanwhile, those darned Hamas leaders in Gaza are in bed  with Iran, while MSB is becoming much more public with the Israel/Saudi Arabia alliance. Abbas also is best frenemies with Israel, having recently renewed their joint security agreement. Even more meanwhile, Hamas totally hates Israel, as does Iran and Hezbollah. So just right now, if the friend of Hamas's enemy is also Hamas's enemy, that looks not cool for Abbas to set foot in Gaza just now. What a soap opera, but in this soap opera, people get killed. Date line 11-22-2017  Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Saad Hariri walked back his resignation on Wednesday after weeks of intensive international diplomacy aimed at restoring the delicate political balance that has kept the country from being pulled apart by regional tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Hariri\u2019s decision to stay on, provisionally at least, is an embarrassment to Riyadh, which is widely seen as having orchestrated the resignation. But the kingdom\u2019s increasingly activist leadership \u2014 led by the 32-year-old crown prince who is spearheading the kingdom\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 can take solace in having revived the conversation about the formidable influence wielded in Lebanon by the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. The reversal capped a dramatic two-and-a-half weeks that saw Hariri resign suddenly from Riyadh on Nov. 4, then traveled to Paris, Egypt, and Cyprus, before finally returning home on the eve of Lebanon\u2019s 74th Independence Day celebrations. -- https://apnews.com/0225bc96851d46f2861a8da069b7b1db"], [41586, "2017-11-22T18:02:54Z", [0.05], "Because recent administration pressure for a deal probably reduce chances (already low) for a visit in the near future."], [32872, "2017-11-22T17:45:26Z", [0.0], ""], [15548, "2017-11-22T17:22:35Z", [0.01], ""], [35, "2017-11-22T15:41:08Z", [0.19], ""], [2965, "2017-11-22T14:21:32Z", [0.04], "down 4 on US designation of PLO as terrorist organization"], [38903, "2017-11-22T13:25:19Z", [0.41], "Significant issues in the implementation of the signed reconciliation still exist.

Likelihood of this deal coming to fruition in terms of a meaningful transfer of administrative power from Hamas to the PA is nearly zero:\n-Obstacle #1: Hamas has strongly declared that it will not disband its 25,000+ strong military arm (Qassam brigade) https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/1.818235. Huge problem for the reality of a transfer-of-power from Hamas to the PA. The PA still maintains its policy of paying pre-2007 Fatah government workers and police officers to not work for Hamas, and will have to form a new administrative government as Hamas has dissolved its \"administrative committee.\" The expectations inside Gaza, however, still revolve around a power-sharing agreement (Sami Abdel-Shafi, an independent political consultant in Gaza City, says, \"In the West Bank some people are talking about a complete governmental takeover in Gaza, whereas within Hamas, the language being used is all about political power sharing.\") Besides, what does Fatah-controlled administration really mean or really look like if Hamas maintains 20-25,000 soldiers inside Gaza? -Obstacle #2: President Abbas needs Israel (discussed in detail below). Israel will not support any agreement which does not require Hamas to disarm (Michael Oren, deputy minister for diplomacy in Israel, \"If it [Hamas] does [maintain its arms], then it\u2019s a non-starter for Israel,\u201d https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-reconciliation/palestinian-prime-minister-visits-gaza-in-move-to-reconcile-with-hamas-idUSKCN1C710M). I interpret the U.S.'s position similarly: \"Any Palestinian government must unambiguously and explicitly commit to nonviolence, recognition of the State of Israel, acceptance of previous agreements and obligations between the parties, and peaceful negotiations.\u201d--Jason Greenblatt, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy). The success of any administration in Gaza is going to have to rely on, in part, cooperation with Israel.  -Obstacle #3: Mistrust between Fatah and Hamas. One of the biggest reasons for Hamas conceding administrative control to Fatah was President Abbas's policy of restricting water and electricity to Gaza, as well as refusing to pay government workers in Gaza. Hamas maintains Qassam forces which threw out Fatah in 2007, Fatah maintains loyal police forces on its payroll and would have to build a new administrative organization loyal to itself. Finally, Hamas's primary historical backers have been Qatar and Iran, while under Abbas' leadership Fatah has improved relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia more than any prior Palestinian leader (http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/meast/mideast-hamas-support/index.html).  2. Linked to the above, President Abbas has too many competing obligations to outside powers to risk meeting with Hamas leadership:\n-Obligations to Saudi Arabia (recently met with King Salman at King Salman's sudden behest https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/11/6/abbas-in-impromptu-visit-to-meet-saudi-crown-prince)\n-Obligations to working with Israel: For the past several decades the only route to reaching a peace agreement with Israel (read \"Bettering the lives of the Palestinian people\") has been working with Israel. A few on-the-ground successes Fatah has achieved from working with Israel:\n----Palestinian security forces have been allowed to take much more responsibility for security, especially in urban areas, in the West Bank--this reduces ugly confrontations between Israeli security forces and Palestinians and improves daily security (Israeli forces tend to focus on anti-terrorism operations, while Palestinian forces focus on anti-crime). \n----Signing of (tenuous) water-sharing agreements with Israeli water companies who hold the trump card of ultimate access require deft cooperation. \n----The securing of Israeli visas for Palestinian workers, a vital part of the Palestinian economy, has required cooperation and demonstrated self-policing on the part of the Palestinians. President Abbas has a fine geopolitical line to walk, and I believe the political costs of meeting with Hamas leadership outweigh the political benefits for him. Finally, despite what a few other forecasters have discussed, I do not believe fear for personal safety is a factor that would keep Abbas from visiting. Hamas has publicly promised multiple times to \"personally guarantee the safety\" of Fatah officials in Gaza, and would lose massive support if it perpetrated or failed to prevent an attempt on Abbas (https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/1.818235)."], [29646, "2017-11-13T21:35:14Z", [0.15], ""], [37379, "2017-11-13T21:09:45Z", [0.11], ""], [38032, "2017-11-13T20:16:34Z", [0.2], "The integration of the factions will be a slow, carefully planned process, with Abbas maybe visiting later down the line.

The most important development is the up-coming meeting (Nov. 21st) in Cairo.  As a reminder, Egypt successfully brokered the first part of the deal in mid-October.   It's also important to note that this meeting was known about in advance of the \"urgent\" meeting in Saudi Arabia earlier this week.   As such, I think there is enough influential parties putting pressure on Abbas to get something done that the talks will be fruitful.  Unfortunately, even if the talks in Cairo are successful that leaves just 1-month for everything to settle and Abbas to get back to Gaza.  Given the Holiday season, I see this as sufficient time and motivation, but only time will tell.   I set my probability a bit higher than I normally would given the Cairo meeting, after which I will re-assess.

It\u2019s important to take the outside view here--it's not the number of his visits in the past seven years but rather what is the baseline number of visits of heads of state after a major peace process or deal?  This is probably pretty high (think Ireland, Columbia and FARC, any major peace process or treaty like between the US and the Soviet Union).  I'd place this at 90% and higher.  There are some international events that are just so big and important that heads of state have to be present, the ceremony matters a lot.  I think in this case, a visit by Abbas, should be expected. But I don't think that's the only probability or question at work in this forecast.   The next part of question is time and that is based on what exactely?  I think it's based on, \"Will this peace process work?\"  What is that baseline?  There were a number of deals in the past, I don't have that number exactly, but I'll guess it's about 2 per a year since 2007.  So there have been five such peace attempts, this being the fifth.  The baseline for success then is somewhere around 1 in 5 or 20%. Adding probabilities together and dividing, that brings it to 46%.  I'm more optimistic about this peace process though, at least being secure enough to lay the ground work for a visit.  There is already an agreement in place and signatures signed.  Whether it holds for a year or two isn't as important as whether or not it's enough of a deal to get a head of state to visit and I think it is. But there is a lot of evidence that this deal is different.  \n1)  Sanctions against Hamas worked.\n2) The deal is signed.\n3) Saudi Arabia backing.\n4) Egypt backing.\n5) Instability and threats from Iran focusing pressure on a solution to focus resources elsewhere. Consider that it's been said he\u2019s coming  soon.  That's a big announcement to make and there a popular expectation that he will come.  I don't know what criteria his office is using to plan the visit and what's driving their timeline but I do think they are planning a visit.  He is pragmatic and don't know if that would raise or lower a probability. But overall I think he will go. The agreement goes into effect on 01 Dec 2017.  This gives 30 days for a visit by Abbas.

That said, given the mention in the NY Times article (among others) that \"if the process goes well, Mr. Abbas could visit Gaza in the coming month,\" we are probably at a higher likelihood than the historical average.  This seems to hinge on what is meant by \"if the process goes well\" and \"in the coming month\".   For starters, the 'process going well' is seemingly in reference to the transfer of the administration of Gaza over to the PA effective Dec 1st. But what exactly would constitute 'well' is uncertain. No bloodshed? Restoration of electricity supplies to Gaza? Smooth transfer of power? Ticker tape parade? I really don't what 'well' means to Abbas. At any rate, 'poorly' would probably look like nothing actually happening, which seems fairly likely to me given the numerous points of contention between Hamas and Fatah. The other question is what 'in the coming month' is supposed to mean. In the month following the announcement? This would suggest a visit sometime this month. Or in month following things going well? Suggesting maybe a December visit? If the visit were imminent, I would expect more coverage trying to hype the affair. I'm thinking the best likelihood of a near term visit, if there is going to be one at all, would be sometime in December conditioned on a smooth administrative transfer.  I'm going to say 20% probability for starters, to reflect the current reconciliation attempts and official statements regarding the possibility of a visit. But if we get to December and it looks like the transfer process is floundering, I will start sharply degrading toward the historical average.
