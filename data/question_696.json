Smart cars should not be vacuuming up huge amounts of data from the public and selling it, either for profit or to subsidise their glorified taxi service.

A few things stand out to me:\n1. Applications for these incumbent automakers appear to be fast tracked. We don't have approval dates for Cadillac or Cruise, but all the press around Cruise's application seem to imply that approval was a slam dunk. I'd been working on the assumption that it was approved, but it would still be nice to see some confirmation just to check my six. It could be that Kyle Vogt's thank you to Gov. Cuomo [5] was premature, but given all that's been happening since, I'd say approval is a safe assumption.\n2. Execution by incumbents is fast. Audi tested within 2 weeks of approval. Can't say when Cadillac was approved.\n3. Cruise is not GM's first rodeo with regard to testing in the state. They also already have experience with one of their brands testing in NYC under the current legislation which required \"direct supervision\" by the state police.\n4. You've got to dig for this information. I would have expected some of this to be covered more heavily in the press, but I've found surprisingly little. Another example outside of NY would be Waymo's winter testing in Michigan [6]. There was a bit of fanfare in the beginning, but so little since that it's rather inferential.

It was referred to the Ways and Means committee on 18 Jan 2018. So, in light of this new evidence how likely is it that they would extend their testing time frame, given that the law had originally been set to expire in April with a report deadline of 1 March? I've found no evidence that the DMV March deadline has moved and I don't expect it to even if the amended legislation passes because in both current and proposed legislation, the commissioner of motor vehicles is required to submit a report on autonomous vehicle demonstrations or tests conducted in the state before 1 June. They may not care whether they've conducted a test so that the commissioner can report on it. But does give them some breathing room. I'd still call it \"early 2018\" if they tested any time in April, but that's subjective. It would also release them from \"direct supervision\" from the state police - whatever that consists of - so it does relax their testing environment in that regard. Linked In now shows Cruise Automation has a Community and Government Relations liason who started this month. Perhaps this is a sign of imminent testing, perhaps it's a sign of eventual testing. Perhaps an argument could be made that holding to the original - and still current - legislative timelineIn either case, I'm interpreting it as support for my previous assumption that previously posted jobs on Cruise's career page were filled rather than simply removed. Other employees have conflicting data regarding actual work location/geographic scope of work. TO DO: THINK ABOUT MY CONFIDENCE INTERVAL GIVEN THE TIME FRAME. KEEP DIGGING.

That's certainly good consolation and ripe for the GM folks to rationalize any failure to test in NYC by April 1. Perhaps a bit of a counterpoint to that, however, is that by executing their NYC initiative by April 1 - or perhaps by March 1 depending on whether you view the DMV report requirement as a functional deadline - they prove that they can execute rapid development and deploy in spite of the challenges in doing so. I'd say they are motivated enough to do it as it would be a central point of differentiation aimed directly at Tesla's inability to hit targets and deadlines.

Since acquiring Cruise Automation, a San Francisco startup, in spring 2016, GM and Cruise have developed four generations of autonomous Chevrolet Bolt EVs. But the last version has no steering wheel, and no pedals for accelerating or braking. Doors open and close automatically. Those functions are handled by software, sensors and a laser-guidance technology called LiDAR. Seven states, including Michigan, allow such vehicles to be tested with federal approval. The other six are North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, Colorado and Nevada. But before a vehicle can transport people, it must meet a battery of standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The legal problem is that those standards require compliance through tests with a human driver as well as manual steering, acceleration and braking controls. Leading this journey through the regulatory process is Paul Hemmersbaugh, former NHTSA general counsel who resigned from the agency a year ago to join GM as chief counsel and policy director for transportation as a service. \"We are asking NHTSA to give us permission to meet the safety standards through a different approach because we can\u2019t achieve them now without a human driver or steering wheel,\" said Hemmersbaugh. \"When you don\u2019t have a steering wheel it makes no sense to talk about an air bag in the steering wheel.\" Read more:  GM: Driverless cars can be affordable and profitable General Motors' Cruise Automation aims to test self-driving cars in New York City But here's another challenge: NHTSA has had no chief since former administrator Mark Rosekind left in November 2016. In April he was hired by Zoox, a San Francisco autonomous technology firm, as chief safety innovation officer.   For the last year, Jack Danielson, a career civil servant and fourth in the agency's chain of command, has run NHTSA. Many key vacancies, including permanent chief counsel, director for government affairs and chief financial officer have not been filled.
