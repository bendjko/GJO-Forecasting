Also placed on review for downgrade were South Africa's (P)Baa2/(P)P-2 shelf and MTN program ratings. \"The decision to place the ratings on review was prompted by the continuing rise in risks to the country's medium-term economic prospects and to its fiscal strength, notwithstanding the tighter fiscal stance undertaken in the 2016/17 budget. The review will allow Moody's to assess to what extent government policy can stabilize the economy and restore fiscal strength in the face of heightened domestic and international market volatility.\n . . .\n\" . . . The first driver for the review is to allow Moody's to assess to the likelihood that the decline in South Africa's economic strength will be reversed over the medium term.  . . .  growth prospects have worsened. Moody's expects growth to decline still further, to 0.5% in 2016, as a consequence of the intensification of this year's drought, low commodity prices as well as the volatility in global and domestic financial markets since December, resulting in a further steep depreciation of the exchange rate and widening bond yields. The drought has necessitated imports of key grain crops and pushed up food prices and overall inflation rates, leading to interest rate rises which have further undermined growth. This has also led the government to reallocate spending from other areas to provide drought relief. \"During the review, Moody's will assess the likely effectiveness of the government's plans, including those contained in the National Development Plan, to address structural constraints on a more inclusive growth through improvements in infrastructure. The rating agency will also use the review period to examine whether recent reforms, such as the amendment to the Labor Relations Act last year, are likely to reduce work stoppages from strikes as the end of various key wage agreements approaches and thereby potentially improve how business views the labor market environment in South Africa. \"The second driver of the review is to allow Moody's to assess whether government policy is likely to lead to a reversal in the continuing erosion of the government's balance sheet.  . . .  The worsening debt dynamic was another factor Moody's noted when assigning a negative outlook to the rating in December 2015. As with growth, the debt position has continued to deteriorate, even if only slightly. Despite the government's adherence to expenditure ceilings in recent years, adverse growth and revenue dynamics have resulted in debt to GDP (excluding guarantees) increasing to 50% of GDP this fiscal year from a trough of 26.5% in March 2009. The deterioration in key fiscal and debt metrics has rendered the country's public finances increasingly vulnerable to negative shocks. \"During the review, Moody's will examine the likelihood of the recently announced 2016/17 budget and medium term expenditure framework being implemented as intended, and achieving the stated objective of consolidating the public finances and reversing the deterioration in fiscal strength witnessed in recent years. The ratings agency will explore the implications of expensive schemes, such as nuclear energy and National Health Insurance, for the government's finances in an environment of rising interest rates. It will also assess the implications for policy of the prolonged lull in growth, persistent spending pressures and political drivers such as the upcoming local elections. \"Moody's could downgrade the rating if the review were to conclude that government policy and strategy is unlikely to lead to a reversal in the debt trajectory. Evidence of further shocks to growth and/or lower confidence in policymakers' commitment to fiscal restraint could lead to a downgrade. Further deterioration in the investment climate would also place downward pressure on the rating if it undermined medium-term growth prospects and/or the availability of external financing for the current account deficit. More generally, indications that the slowdown in growth will be even deeper and more protracted than currently expected would be negative for the rating. \"Moody's would confirm the rating at Baa2 if the review were to conclude that policymakers will maintain spending restraint, succeed in the delivery of planned structural reforms, achieve the fiscal consolidation envisioned in the 2016/17 Budget Review, and thereby reverse the deterioration in key credit metrics witnessed in the past few years.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This question closes in 21 days.

Rating: Baa2\nOutlook: Stable A Moody's rating of Baa2 is a \"medium grade, with some speculative elements and moderate credit risk\"[1]. Other countries with a Baa2 rating at the moment include Italy, Colombia, the Philippines, and Spain[2]. So, roughly speaking, Baa2 is risky by the standards of Europe but fairly solid by the standards of the less developed (and/or formerly colonized) world (which includes South Africa).  Now, South Africa's last change in rating from Moody's took place on November 11, 2014 and was a downgrade from Baa1. According to Moody's, \"The key drivers of [South Africa's 11-112014] rating downgrade are the following: 1) Poor medium-term growth prospects due to structural weaknesses, including ongoing energy shortages as well as rising interest rates, further deterioration in the investor climate and a less supportive capital market environment for countries such as South Africa that are highly dependent on external capital. 2) The prospect of further rises in the government debt-to-GDP ratio implied by the low-growth environment, which even strict compliance with the government spending ceiling and somewhat smaller fiscal deficits are unlikely to arrest in the near term.\"[3] Why might South Africa be downgraded further by Moody's? \"South Africa's ratings could be downgraded if the official commitment to fiscal consolidation and debt stabilization falters, or if the investment climate deteriorates further, imperiling the availability of external financing for the current account deficit.\"[4]\nObviously, the next question to ask is whether South Africa is meeting any of these conditions. But that question turns out to be a messy one to try to answer. On the one hand, South Africa seemed to get off on the right foot, only to stumble soon thereafter. The nation's leadership initially appeared to be trying to achieve fiscal consolidation[5], but the firing late last year of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene (which was part of a parade of \"three finance ministers in two weeks\"[6]) raised real questions about South Africa's ability to achieve fiscal consolidation and debt stabilization. Indeed, Standards and Poor's did downgrade South Africa last month[7].  But on the other hand, it's not all bad news for South Africa. The current regime in South Africa seems to be taking the possibility of a downgrade pretty seriously[8], and President Jacob Zuma has been making the right kind of noises on this topic[9]. In general, South Africa does seem to be making an effort to allay concerns of this kind. \"The controversy and market reaction to Zuma\u2019s decision to fire Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene on Dec. 9 may have served as a wake-up call to the authorities, Goolam Ballim, chief economist at Standard Bank, told reporters in Johannesburg.\"[10] Yet note that GDP growth for this year is expected to be quite low - about 1%[11] or worse[12], And tough economic times in South Africa might make it very difficult for Zuma to deliver on his promises to the ratings agencies and other interested parties[13]. I remain open to the changing my mind (a lot!) about the possibility that South Africa will be downgraded before April 1. But currently, I'd say there's about a 13% of this happening.  But our question is not whether Moody's will downgrade South Africa's rating before April 1. It's whether Moody's will downgrade South Africa's rating to a B-grade before April 1. Just how bad is a B rating from Moody's? Pretty bad. Here are a few of the states that have ratings between B1 and B3: B1: Cyprus, Ethiopia \nB2: Cambodia\nB3: Ecuador, Pakistan, Egypt, Belarus In order for South Africa to be downgraded to B or below, it would have to go through several other grades first: Baa3, Ba1, Ba2, and Ba3[14]. Of course, Moody's could downgrade South Africa several grades at once, but that's unusual. How unusual? It's a really good question, and I had a hard time answering it. Individual firms and municipalities are sometimes subjected to massive downgrades. E.g., Moody's downgraded Atlantic City six notches in 2015[15]. But I can't find anything similar in the case of the debt of a sovereign nation. Downgrading South Africa to a B rating would be comparable to downgrading Italy (also currently rated Baa2) to the level of Ethiopia or Cambodia. And the odds of that happening can't be much higher that 1%. -- [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating#Moody.27s [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody%27s_Investors_Service [3] https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-South-Africa-to-Baa2-outlook-changed-to-stable--PR_312007 [4] https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-South-Africa-to-Baa2-outlook-changed-to-stable--PR_312007 [5] http://www.focus-economics.com/countries/south-africa/news/politics/south-african-government-delivers-austere-2015-budget-aimed-at [6]http://businesstech.co.za/news/government/112215/time-is-up-for-south-africa/ [7] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-18/south-africa-s-yield-premium-above-peer-average-for-first-time [8] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/south-africa-vows-to-avoid-downgrade-to-junk-business-day-says [9] http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2016/02/10/Zuma-must-stop-government-scoring-own-goals [10] http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/zuma-meets-south-african-ceos-as-investor-confidence-fades [11] http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2016/02/10/Zuma-must-stop-government-scoring-own-goals [12] http://mybroadband.co.za/news/general/154830-south-africas-economy-is-heading-to-zero.html [13] http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/world/africa/rivals-disrupt-jacob-zumas-speech-on-south-african-economy.html [14] https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/AboutMoodysRatingsAttachments/MoodysRatingSymbolsandDefinitions.pdf [15] http://articles.philly.com/2015-01-28/business/58513136_1_atlantic-city-borgata-downgrade https://pythagorassite.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/will-moodys-downgrade-south-africas-government-issuer-rating-to-b-or-below-before-1-april-2016/\n"], [19311, "2016-02-12T13:37:14Z", [0.01], ""], [17819, "2016-02-12T07:34:27Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2016-02-12T00:38:41Z", [0.01], ""], [19680, "2016-02-11T18:59:18Z", [0.63], ""], [10039, "2016-02-11T17:06:11Z", [0.0], ""], [15964, "2016-02-11T15:42:09Z", [0.0], ""], [19801, "2016-02-11T07:48:34Z", [0.18], "Improbable.

Gordhan, who was respected during a first period as finance minister from 2009-14, said the government and the ruling African National Congress had \u201ca very profound and practical commitment to further fiscal consolidation\u201d, as well as creating a \u201cmore dynamic growth path\u201d. \u201cFinance ministers, in particular, are very good at not wasting crises, and in a sense, focusing the mind, both within government and outside, on the necessity to do the fiscally correct things,\u201d Gordhan told the FT. The chaos surrounding Gordhan\u2019s appointment means he is under pressure to deliver an austere budget later this month. He is expected to outline measures to raise additional revenue and cut government spending under the watchful eye of wary rating agencies and investors.\""], [9755, "2016-02-04T00:21:54Z", [0.07], ""], [51, "2016-02-03T22:06:28Z", [0.0], "Falling to B is a pretty steep drop.

I adjust this downwards to reflect the lower likelihood of default in the next two months vs. the one year. The problem with this estimate is twofold. One, is that this is an estimate that is probably to focused on more developed countries (US/EU) and does not take into account the very country specific problems that South Africa is facing. The second problem is the timing. Moody's does not have an estimate for 2 months out readily available, so I make the assumption that the likelihood of downgrade  increases with time linearly (they are more likely to get downgraded the further out in time we go), this is probably an oversimplification as the decrease in probability is most certainly not linearly based, but for purposes of simplicity this is what I have done. I then examine the country spefific risks SA is currently facing (and there are many). They are over exposed to commodities - which are in the midst of decades lows. They have 25% unemployement and face political unrest - this could lead to spending on domestic programs to help retain ANC power, but weakening SAs financial position in the long run. S&P has warned of a credit downgrade and Moody's has put their outlook negative. All of these risks inrease the likelihood of default. I view each of these events as increasing near term probablity by about 1-2%. On the other hand, I see a few major factors benefiting SA in the short term - which for purposes of this analysis is what matters.  The ANC is facing potentially very close elections ~May of this year. This could mean that Zumas government is willing to spend money to appease the 25% of unemployed citizens, but I think it will mean something else. Zuma is very politically astute and seems to understand what he needs to do to stay in power - he appointed the current finance minister Pravin Gordhan after only the previous minister was in office for only 4 days and amidst investor and market backlash. This seems to indicate that Zuma recognizes if SA is downgraded to junk status, it would most certainly cost the ANC in the coming elections. I view this as positive for term reform, thus decreasing the odds of a near term downgrade by 2% or so. Net net I think the likelihood of a downgrade in the near term seems unlikely (3%), but not zero because of the exposure to mining and commodities sectors, combined with SAs historical in ability to restructure its often inept government."], [691, "2016-01-28T12:14:35Z", [0.01], ""], [16793, "2016-01-27T22:08:37Z", [0.0], "Unprecedented to be downgraded 7 levels in 2 months is absolutely not happening.

South Africa\u2019s economy IS in a bad state, mostly due to the downturn in prices for their main exports. It is important to compare their chances to those counties of whom currently hold the same ratings and although they have a very high unemployment rate (24.9%) that is only topped by Spain\u2019s \u2013 meaning real wages & therefore spending will be low making it difficult for the government to eat into its debt which is 38% of GDP, historically \u2013 countries debt:GDP levels often top 60 \u2013 70% before a downgrade.

The only reason for an announcement ahead of schedule would be in the event of a default. South Africa doesn't have a bond maturing before April 1st so they can't default on a Principal payment.

One way to do this is to look at Moody's rating transition rates.  You can find them here: https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/2007100000486361.pdf These are transition rates that can be used in a Markov model.  I am using the table \u201cAverage One Year Alphanumeric Rating Migration Rates, 1983-2007\u201d.  This table give the probabilities of transitioning from one credit rating to another.  The probabilities for the next year are as follows: Baa2 -to- Baa1 = 6.505% [goes up one rating step]\nBaa2 -to- Baa2 = 72.610% [stays the same]\nBaa2 -to- Baa3 = 6.555% [goes down one rating step]\nBaa2 -to- Ba1 = 1.703% [goes down two rating steps]\nBaa2 -to- Ba2 = 0.648% [goes down three rating steps]\nBaa2 -to- Ba3 = 0.718% [goes down four rating steps]\nBaa2 -to- B1 = 0.493% [goes down four rating steps] I am interpreting the question as meaning a transition from Baa2 -to- Ba1 or below (a _two_ step drop).  Based on the base transition rates, this is a relatively low probability.  (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_credit_rating for an explanation of investment grade vs junk bonds for nations.) The next question to consider is how often Moody's changes its ratings.  Note that the latest change to South Africa was made December 15, 2015.  It appears that credit ratings don't change often.  Given that South Africa was just changed, it would seem that it is a low probability that it will change again in the next three months. Next, the South African economy is a mess.  Is it likely that it will get dramatically worse in the next three months?  The currency is falling.  I believe this is due to both mismanagement, corruption and the fact that the South African economy is resource/commodity based.  For Moody's to transition it two spots down in the next three months, I believe they would have to set the place on fire."], [1529, "2016-01-11T20:44:40Z", [0.05], "April is so close.

If the international markets are applying this pressure, maybe Moody's and S&P will have to take note and revisit question sooner than they expected.

GDP growth for the 2014 - 2015 fiscal year has been rather paltry (0.78). It's forecasted rate for both middle income countries and as a BRICs member is expected to decline further for the 2015 - 2016 fiscal year. A significant effect on currency devaluation is external debt and external balance. The decline of growth among BRICs nations also has a significant effect of global growth in the global economy. Additionally, a sharp decline in commodity prices weaken trade balances, affecting external debt and external balances. Therefore, a relatively low rate of economic growth suggests that a country\u2019s existing debt burden will become more problematic to service over time. Foreign indebtedness may become unsustainable over time. Consumer prices in South Africa rose 4.6 percent year-on-year in August of 2015, easing from a 5 percent increase in July. It is the lowest inflation rate in three months and slightly below market expectations as cost of housing and utilities slowed while transport prices fell. When a gov- ernment appears unable or unwilling to pay for current budgetary expenses through taxes or debt issuance, it must resort to inflationary money finance. Public dissatisfaction with inflation may in turn lead to political instability. A cursory view of the data suggest that if deflation continues along the trend (such as the two downgrades in the last couple month of 2015) and a potential downgrade in 2016 could spell disaster for South Africa. If growth in developing continue to decline (expected based on forecasts of growth rates) along with decline in the global economy (particularly with regard to the Chinese/South African trade relationship) will continue to hamper domestic growth, possibly leading to a recession (which it narrowly missed this past year). Economic instability, factionalism within and among political parties, poor governance, decline in its tax rate, increase in its external debt and political instability (measures as riots, demonstrations, declines in productivity in its economy and a negative balance between exports and imports are among a few determinants that will continue to negatively affect investor perceptions, actual investment declines, and primarily its ability to service external debt, all \nwhich contribute to potential downgrading in its sovereign ratings. This in turn also affects the potential for furthers currency devaluation and market instability, primarily constrained by the global economy. This does not bode well for South Africa in the short or long term. So, my forecasting revised estimate will be to increase the potential for a downgrade within the next 6 months or so; however, since it currently is rated as Baa2, a single downgrade will move into a Baa3 rating increasing negative perceptions of its economy and political system. However, I suspect the downgrades will not move out the B range within the next six month.

According to Moody\u2019s, persistently weak growth, the growing risk of fiscal slippages and political pressures were reasons for the change. This is noteworthy after the merry-go-round at the finance ministry in the last week. President Jacob Zuma sent the country and the markets into shock last Wednesday evening by suddenly replacing respected finance minister Nhlanhla Nene with a relative unknown, who was himself replaced a few days later by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The markets and rand went into freefall with the first announcement but started to steady after Gordhan was reappointed. The consensus in business by Tuesday was that a lot of damage had been done and it would take some time to recover. Moody\u2019s did, however, affirm the country\u2019s Baa2 rating, \u201cbecause of the country\u2019s track record of sound macroeconomic policies\u201d. A statement from Moody\u2019s added: \u201cAlthough growth has continually disappointed in recent years due to a combination of domestic and external circumstances, spending restraint and the buoyancy of fiscal revenues to date has led to only marginal deviations for budget deficits and debt.\u201d The Moody\u2019s rating is still a notch above Fitch\u2019s newly assigned BBB- foreign currency credit rating with a stable outlook and one notch above Standard & Poor\u2019s BBB- foreign currency credit rating with a negative outlook. Both Fitch and S&P revised South Africa\u2019s credit ratings downwards on December 4. Both of these agencies distinguish between foreign currency and local currency creditworthiness and therefore have separate local currency ratings: BBB+ for S&P and BBB for Fitch. This difference between the foreign and local currency ratings is an important but little recognised distinction, according to Peter Worthington, principal and senior economist at Barclays Africa. The market tends to focus on the foreign currency credit ratings, especially regarding a potential downgrade to sub-investment grade status, so-called junk, for South Africa.\" http://www.citizen.co.za/910743/moodys-downgrades-outlook-sa-credit-rating/"], [506, "2016-01-05T21:05:37Z", [0.05], ""], [915, "2016-01-05T21:02:42Z", [0.0], "B is pretty severe.
