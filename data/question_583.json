That said, some of those were cases in which the panel was established at the first Dispute Resolution Board meeting following the request. I think that is very unlikely in this case given the general tendency to defer establishment in the first meeting, as well as UAE's non-compliance with the process to this point.  Given that, if we look only at the cases in which a panel was not established in the first DSB meeting, the amount of those having a panel established in the necessary time frame drops to about 20%.

File complaint, wait up to 10 days for a response.\n2. Responding parties to enter into negotiations within 30 days.\n3. Negotiations given 60 days to reach a resolution. \n4. If no resolution, a panel may be established. So Article 4 plays out in no less than 30 days (no response from anyone) or up to 90 days (if there is a response but everyone drags their feet). And that is assuming that there is no mechanism for extending initial negotiations, which I'm sure there is (but I admittedly couldn't find). Then we move on to establishing a panel. The first question is who will be on the panel. Per the WTO:  \"Panels are like tribunals. But unlike in a normal tribunal, the panellists are usually chosen in consultation with the countries in dispute. Only if the two sides cannot agree does the WTO director-general appoint them. Panels consist of three (possibly five) experts from different countries who examine the evidence and decide who is right and who is wrong.\" From here: https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm My predictions:  1. Initial negotiations will take at least 60 days and will not be successful.\n2. The parties will not agree on panel membership, and sorting that out will take at least another 60 days.
