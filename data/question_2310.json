Russia\u2019s \u201cforeign agents\u201d law is largely seen as a way for the Kremlin to crack down on organizations that it finds disagreeable, such as the human rights group, Memorial. The law requires all nonprofits that receive outside funding to register as foreign agents, which bars them from participating in any activity that is perceived to be political or interfering with domestic affairs.\nOutside observers consider the Levada Center one of the most reputable sources of polling within Russia. Without it, an accurate sense of public opinion is hard to come by.
