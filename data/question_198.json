With government estimates putting Twitter's Iranian user base at 4 million, it's clear that this policy hasn't been a great success. \". . . when Iranian Twitter users are political, they're overwhelmingly reformist\u2014around a fifth of the users in our network are members of reformist-leaning groups, compared to the 3% who are associated with conservative groups. Consequently, conservatives have found themselves squeezed to the margins, sharing the Twitter wilderness with the spam-bot armies of the exiled Mujahedin-e Khalq opposition group. \"Twitter isn't all politics, however. We found that the Iranian Twittersphere is home to a large community of technology experts, bloggers, and entrepreneurs who sit at the beating heart of Iran's thriving tech sector. These tech communities exist alongside sprawling communities of cultural enthusiasts \u2014 poets, writers and filmgoers \u2014 along with plenty of other users who just want to chat, flirt, and share cat videos. \"Given the ongoing restrictions on political and social activities, Twitter offered a valuable space to debate and campaign during the election period. Although it has been eclipsed by Telegram and Facebook in terms of its user base, Twitter continues to serve a valuable function to bridge the gap between Iran's citizens and the country's diaspora. \"Key findings:\nReformists dominate Twitter-based politics in Iran \u2014 around a fifth of the users in our network are members of reformist-leaning groups, compared to the 3% who are associated with conservative groups.\nTwitter was a key election news source, but campaigning happened elsewhere \u2014 Although plenty of Iranian citizens used Twitter to share the latest election news, it looks like more popular platforms like Facebook and Telegram were host to more political campaigning.\nReformists are better campaigners on Twitter \u2014 The campaigns that did emerge on Twitter were mostly driven by reformists. Conservative campaigns were only shared within groups of diehard conservatives, whereas reformist messages spread throughout the network.\nTwitter is an important bridge between the diaspora and Iran \u2014 Around a quarter of the network is composed of Iranians who state they are living in the diaspora. These members are very well integrated into both political and apolitical networks, rather than making up a separate group.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  It sounds to me like Iranians have found adequate work-arounds for accessing Twitter and given that more liberals use it than conservatives, I do not see the ban being lifted in the short term because there is a lack of pressure to do so and conservative politicians who would oppose it.\n"], [691, "2016-08-08T18:57:08Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2016-08-08T17:39:20Z", [0.0], ""], [22833, "2016-08-08T13:14:51Z", [0.0], ""], [22243, "2016-08-08T13:01:34Z", [0.0], ""], [90, "2016-08-07T22:13:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1023, "2016-08-07T22:04:01Z", [0.0], "Not without their own control system."], [38, "2016-08-07T21:14:00Z", [0.0], "http://www.voanews.com/content/iran-pokemon-go-ban/3452601.html Iran has just banned Pokemon Go, labeling it a threat to security and safety.

A decade later, thanks in part to the introduction of smartphones and tablets, internet access across the country has increased enormously (best estimate for 2016 is that more than 65% of the population have regular, domestic access, with more able to access the internet through public or shared facilities); in 2014, approximately 50% of Iranians had accessed, or were regularly accessing, social media platforms 'illegally'. Notably, senior members of the Iranian regime are avid users of social media themselves (President Rouhani, for instance, has two twitter accounts, and regularly posts 'selfies'). It is clear, therefore, that the 2006 ban is an anachronism which no longer fits contemporary Iranian society. As a result, powerful figures within the Iranian government have called for the ban to be partially lifted. Rouhani is seen as a moderniser, who is more likely than his conservative predecessors to relax the ban to a degree. Moreover, the Iranian regime clearly appreciates the power of social media as a propaganda tool, both against the West, and against rising Sunni militancy in the Middle East (which is thought of as a direct threat to Shia Iran), and is keen to harness its power in that regard. All this means that a review of the 2006 ban is more likely now than it was at any point prior to Rouhani's election in 2013. However, the governing principle of Iran's current 'glasnost' is one of gradual, controllable reform. A total lifting of the ban on social media would remove all government control and is extremely improbable for that reason. The status quo actually suits the government very well: Facebook and Twitter are blocked, and accessing them remains illegal, but only very modest efforts are made to capture and punish those who circumvent the ban (enabling the government to act only where and when it needs to, hence ensuring that the government retains control). Moreover, Rouhani is known to favour an approach similar to that taken in China, where domestic platforms are used, whilst open social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) remain largely off-limits to the general population - there are reports that similar systems are already being developed in Iran. Above all, the chief benefit of Facebook and Twitter to the Iranian regime is felt abroad, rather than at home - they are used to connect with Iranians and other Shia overseas, and to spread pro-regime information. As such, the benefits to the regime of legalising access to them domestically are very limited. A total lifting of the ban on Twitter or Facebook is extremely unlikely, primarily because the current situation is so convenient for the regime; a partial or superficial relaxing of restrictions is conceivable, but not likely in the short term. At any rate, it is probable that the Iranian government will trial other measures first."], [368, "2016-06-21T17:12:44Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2016-06-21T11:26:53Z", [0.01], ""], [26327, "2016-06-21T05:58:59Z", [0.03], "If a leaders in Iran can live with the absurdity using banned twitter and facebook, I see no reason them to lift ban.
