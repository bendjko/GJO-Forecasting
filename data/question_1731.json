It would be in Trump's favor to cancel the third debate as well to continue speaking to his audience directly uninterrupted through an open townhall style meeting that's broadcast nationally. Also, the covid-19 issue continues to be a big sticking point and its possible the Biden campaign may still want to avoid a face-to-face with trump in a week. Biden could also get Covid-19 and that could throw a wrench into this whole question. Alternatively, Trump will be better and it will be harder for Biden to make the case that the debates need to be virtual because more time has passed.

The claim that he will not participate because they changed the rules, I suspect, is a ruse or deflection such that he now has a reason not to participate that does not involve admitting that he is not well enough. He may feel that he can do better in the election by going to rallies instead.  I would estimate that there is about a 50 percent chance that he is too sick to perform well enough in a debate to participate.  I guess there is a 25 percent chance that he is afraid that well or sick the debate will hurt him.  Finally, there is a 25 percent chance that it was just all due to his ranting, considering his complaints about his most loyal aides made during the same Fox News interview.  If his refusal is due to illness, he might recover in time for the third debate.  If he thinks debates hurt him even if he is well,  he will not participate in both remaining debates.

These all occurred either in late September or October, a period which is still over a month and a half away. So historically, it would seem 2-3 debates would be most likely, with 0-1 being virtually unheard of in modern political history. Biden has also committed to all three scheduled debates (he did so in June), further increasing the chances all three are held.\nHowever, there are several reasons that less than three debates would be held. First, there is the pandemic, which will change the possible optics of a debate and won't allow candidates to exude as much confidence/competence (picture Trump following Clinton around the stage versus Trump crouched over in front of a laptop). With candidates swapping jabs about cognitive ability and old age, such optics may lead to one or both sides excusing themselves from later debates.\nSimilarly, Trump is currently finding as many ways as possible to get in front of cameras and speak to the American people. The debates would give him another avenue to do this. However, as we saw with his COVID task force briefings, he will forego the limelight if doing otherwise may tarnish his image (bleach, anyone?).
