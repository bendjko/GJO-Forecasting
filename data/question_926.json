When Musk keeps producing bad forecasts (if you make forecasts that that are consistently wrong I think they can be fairly  described as bad forecasts) and rubbishing the analysis of financial commentators an objective observer can only conclude that Musk is either desperate, over confident or has lost touch with reality, or is a business genius. The only facts we know are that Musk's forecasts are bad and he does not like non-believes pointing it out.  In the medium term (2 to 3 years) I would questions the outlook for Tesla. It has  products that are regarded as \"cool\" that are produced in small volumes, that sell to believers in the ideas behind the products. The problem is that as it increases its volume it will need to sell its products to people who want a car that delivers on a practical level, these people might quite like the ideas, but they also expect a quality product and an economic price. Tesla does not have ten years to learn how to produce cars where the panels fit perfectly and everything looks and feels as solid as a BMW. Lots of \"cool\" products have died because their USP become mainstream but their products became high priced, low quality commodity items.  But the question here only covers the next 7 or 8 weeks, not the next 5 years.    \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-beats-earnings-expectations-cuts-expenses-and-promises-profits-2018-05-02\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-build-quality-explained-2018-2"], [57778, "2018-05-03T09:06:07Z", [0.0], "quarter results out so, unlikely that there will be anything to bring it down in a month"], [43311, "2018-05-03T08:48:00Z", [0.0], ""], [46762, "2018-05-03T07:52:17Z", [0.0], "Well, as I said on my first prediction, I was going to ride yes till the quarter results came out.

And yes, I purposely use quotes around \"crashes\" because when we here Tesla \"crashes\" we really are being directed to one major crash that occurred during march of 2018 (https://www.livescience.com/62292-tesla-model-x-crash-statement.html). This crash was blown out of proportion by the media and Tesla was not found guilty because the driver was largely at fault due to neglecting the clearly prompted rules promoted by Tesla during the early release of the assisted driver tech. Obviously, if major crashes occur before the 29th of June and  they are clearly found to be blamed by Tesla's negligence , then it will move the price significantly. But for this to drop the price by more than $100, it would have to be a lot of crashes or one that is very dismal. What I really want to say here is that the crashes are probably the worst indicator for a quick future price drop. On the  business end, there is more to be said about Tesla. In my opinion, the company faces two major issues. These issues are the amount of debt being accumulated and the issue with lagging production relative to large pre-order lists for the Model 3 (http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/28/news/companies/tesla-model-3-cash-crunch/index.html). The current production rate of the Model 3 is said to be sitting between 3,000 to 4,000 cars as of this month according to Elon Musk but as of April it was at 2,250 cars. I would safely put the number in the low 3,000s (https://www.recode.net/2018/5/1/17291940/elon-musk-tesla-profit-losses-earnings-2018-model3).  The debt is also of concern due to the $2.8 billion accounts payable tab and the company not turning a profit. Overall, these issues are probably not going to effect Tesla in such a short time period considering the improving production numbers. Also, the price seems to move, but not by that much.
