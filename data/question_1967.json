The endorsements and alliances surrounding him are not exactly what people in the city would describe as the politicians with the most integrity or overall record of accomplishment around, but they certainly know how to get in power.\nEarly voting has not been great, there's a lot of confusion and mistrust about vote ranking (will my favorite get hurt in the process if I rank others, how does it work, why does it matter, I dont know any of these people let me just mark first 5 names). People seem to be more uninformed than ever and are pretty much responding to the candidate with greater visibility (who can afford to bombard voters most with mailers and ads, texts and calls). \nBut I still think there's a lot of unpredictability when it comes to the race given turn out and ranking.  The issues with Adams, the front runner, (he does live in NJ, has real estate holdings undisclosed to IRS, failing to pay taxes on them), and things like his recent comments to address education issues \nby suggesting we should keep remote learning, have 1 good teacher for 300 students via zoom, are true deal breakers for informed voters who are the most likely to show up to the polls. \nYang's popularity started winding down, his optimistic attitude has gone far in many communities but his performance at the last debate where his approach was to come across as tough on crime (likely a main, decisive issue in the city now) was very polarizing given what many thought were insensitive, callous comments on people dealing with mental health issues. There is indeed an epidemic of houseless people with severe mental health issues seemingly in every corner of Manhattan. Many if not most of the subway attacks are related to that crisis. This resonates deeply with people, it's the one issue that affects people most directly and hits closer to home right now because it is so visible and present and it's also a symbolism of what the city has gone through and has yet failed to resolve.  We'll have to see what voters respond to best, if the compassionate, human rights focused approach to the mental health and houseless crisis or quick solution, make us feel safe approach by Yang.  People seem to be responding to politicians that are listening and leading with compassion in such a wounded place like NY. Taking a stroll in Midtown can be scary and depressing right now but in a place where so many have suffered a proposal to just get these people off your sight may mostly resonate with a small percentage who like Yang left the city during the height of the pandemic. \nYang's plan to offer $2K per year to 500,000 people at a cost of $1 billion --his response to alleviate extreme poverty as he says --is one of his signature proposals but it's failing to catch up. He's being severely criticized for a proposal that gives people $5 a day while likely eliminating other programs that reach further than cash incentives.\nGarcia is trusted as an efficient, trustworthy problem solver and has received very coveted endorsements. She is well balanced and her proposals are sound but doesn't seem like she has had a thorough outer boroughs outreach. \nWiley is smart and experienced and has fought her way to the top candidates with great skills. She has also attracted a good number of small donations. Notable, seems likely that no one will get 50% of the vote or greater and decision will be decided by ranking. \nNewyorkers are tired, have little patience, having to wait over a month for election results might backfire in terms of participation. The city and state keeps pushing the story that we are back, we are open but it truly feels that we are being conditioned to first believe that in order to make it happen. Imagine a half burned down, ransacked store that it's still cleaning up posting a sign to come in we're open for business. It's a strange time in the city. Most people complaining about streets being too dirty and not feeling safe.  It is however a great time for youth and outdoors parties (NYU and Columbia admissions applications up by over 50%), but that group doesn't traditionally turn out to vote. One of the most interesting elections in NY by far.

And you add in ranked-choice voting, and it\u2019s a lot of confusion. So campaigns are really going to have to do outstanding get-out-the-vote if they really want to win.\u201d [1]\n- In 2013 mayoral election, 66% of voters in primary election were 50+ years old [2].\n- 3 more debates, one in May, and 2 more in June. \n- Anecdotally I think Yang could see increased turnout among his voters because they tend to be loyal/fanatics. Polling [3]:\n- Latest first-past-the-post poll had 50% undecided, which leads me to even the odds due to greater uncertainty. \n- Past two ranked choice polls were financed by Yang's campaign so take them with a grain of salt, but the results were Yang, Adams, Stringer [4]. Digging into the data a little, it looks like 50+ voters were underrepresented based on 2013 voter data, Hispanics were underrepresented based on NYC demographics (although there may be lower Hispanic turnout which would bring the underrepresentation down), and college educated and high income were overrepresented (34% of latest poll had a graduate degree, and median income was $80k compared to $53k of NYC (not voters). Unfortunately the poll did not break down each candidate's favorability by income, so I don't know how to adjust on that factor. Yang had highest favorability of Hispanics among top candidates (49%). And if we look at 55+ voters, Yang and Stringer have the highest favorability (55-60%). Adams has only 42% favorability among 65+ group. Yang has the highest unfavorability among 55+ group (19%). \n- In latest poll, Yang had highest name recognition at 85%, followed by Stringer (64%) and Adams (62%). [5]\n- In latest poll, top 3 issues were vaccine distribution and stopping spread of COVID, public education, and jobs. [5]. Although Yang can do well on jobs, I see other candidates being stronger on managing COVID and public education given their experience in elected office.  Finance [6]:\n- Rank of candidates by balance is Adams, Stringer, McGuire, Wiley, Yang. Adams and Stringer have over $6 million, while Wiley and Yang have under $2 million. So far everyone but McGuire has spent about $1 million. I expect Adams and Stringer to gain ground on Yang with increased spending.  Summary:\nGiven the amount of undecideds and Adams/Stringer finances, I'm inclined to even the odds more between Yang, Adams, Stringer, with Wiley following in fourth. Lowering Yang's base rate of 59% down to 40%. Adams/Stringer at 25%. Wiley at 9%.

He's the most known but that will become less relevant as time progresses. Ranked choice votes can unexpectedly favour a 3rd choice if the top 2 are split. Yangs celebrity is unlikely to make him top but could favour in the split. Stringer and Wiley are likely to fall as the race progresses but if the top is split 3 ways it could lean to Stringer. Stringer likely respectable 3 or 4. Adams has recognition and support so is likely top 2. Whether he can pull in front is debatable and a win depends on being the 2nd choice of others farther down ballot.\nOne voting-reform group, FairVote, found that before ranked-choice voting was implemented in parts of the Bay Area in California, plurality-white districts elected a nonwhite representative 35 percent of the time. Under ranked-choice voting, though, those same districts elected a nonwhite representative 60 percent of the time. 62 percent of New York City citizens of voting age are nonwhite.

So for now he seems like the clear favorite, but remains to be seen if that holds as voters get more familiar with the other candidates. Under the ranked choice voting polls (one of which says it's sponsored by the Yang campaign so unclear if it's fully reliable) Yang currently wins about 60-40 over Eric Adams in the final round. So while Yang appears to be the favorite I think it's too early to give him a massive lead in likelihood.
