Asking profession reviewers, they all would say that \"The Americans\" is the better show, but only a niche segment was watching it. In the list of past Emmy nominees, there was at least one other \"best show on television\" -- with spotless critical praise -- and nobody watched; a series called \"Deadwood\". [3] It drew the best 9 in 10 points from too few critical reviewers and too few lucky TV watchers; so it \"Lost\" the Emmy to JJ Abrams' season 1, that year. This year's \"The Americans\" received spotless (professional) critical praise, too! [1] Unlike Deadwood, more critical reviewers cared to say something, too, with some more fans.  However, \"Eric Schrier, FX\u2019s president . . . , who explained that the nature of the series made it inherently niche.\" [1] Marketers seem to hide its ratings, otherwise you would find them prominently displayed on Wikipedia. \"Of the nearly 2.4 million viewers who tuned in to Season 3 on average, over 1.3 million of them were over 50 years old; fewer than 250,000 viewers between the ages of 18 and 34 were watching. [The core advertising market is 18 to 49.] In fact, no season of \u201cThe Americans\u201d has ever averaged over a million viewers 18 to 34 years old. Season 1 came the closest with 795,000. Younger viewers, it seems, are just not all that interested in the Cold War.\" [1] Season 4 \"kicked off on March 16, 2016, and its debut drew 1.11 million viewers\" [4] \"Better Call Saul\", on the other hand, opened with 2.6 million within the core market. [5] It received spotless critical praise, too, and maintained a 2-million average viewership. No other Emmy nominee has spotless elevated critical reviews. The question is whether the jury panel tilts towards a sinister spy series for the old, or a sinister gangster for the young?
