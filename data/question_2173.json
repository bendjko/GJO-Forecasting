Hungary got a new constitution in 2014 and I don't consider previous elections precisely comparable. So for simplicity's sake I will use the 2018 and 2014 elections as reference classes. Relative to the individual other parties, early polling doesn't look that different than it did in those cases (that is, no single party or set of parties is performing meaningfully better than in the past), so the instrumental scenario that would lead to a situation other than the status quo in this case is the idea that the opposition will in fact be unified. Back to that in a moment. It's definitely possible that Fidesz will lose those two seats- but I don't know how possible it really is. It's true Fidesz is polling a bit lower than it did at this point in the past, but I really don't know how much to update on that. I think the fact that the party has maintained a narrow supermajority for three elections, and an identical seat count for two, should be informative.  So I'll plant a flag here indicating the following vague ideas\n- The fact that Fidesz has maintained narrow electoral supremacy for three elections should count for something. I think more than 10%- maybe between 20% and 25%.\n- A lot of things need to happen for Orban to lose his supermajority, but I don't think those things are crazy."], [103970, "2022-01-01T16:57:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [103878, "2022-01-01T15:50:22Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3], ""], [103965, "2022-01-01T14:09:20Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.5], ""], [60493, "2022-01-01T09:23:32Z", [0.15, 0.75, 0.1], ""], [691, "2021-12-31T22:41:54Z", [0.08, 0.63, 0.29], ""], [103960, "2021-12-31T21:56:27Z", [0.02, 0.2, 0.78], ""], [96618, "2021-12-31T16:11:52Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.35], ""], [1333, "2021-12-31T15:44:35Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], ""], [101602, "2021-12-31T10:15:19Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [45866, "2021-12-30T19:16:33Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [100716, "2021-12-30T17:03:26Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-12-30T02:38:06Z", [0.0, 0.26, 0.74], ""], [76372, "2021-12-29T21:52:48Z", [0.1, 0.24, 0.66], ""], [79515, "2021-12-29T21:25:47Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2], ""], [1332, "2021-12-29T20:16:55Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [76730, "2021-12-29T18:34:06Z", [0.05, 0.4, 0.55], ""], [103822, "2021-12-29T11:45:00Z", [0.58, 0.42, 0.0], ""], [103913, "2021-12-29T11:11:14Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.4], ""], [103910, "2021-12-29T01:11:39Z", [0.02, 0.98, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-12-28T21:45:26Z", [0.1, 0.71, 0.19], ""], [99857, "2021-12-28T18:23:07Z", [0.07, 0.53, 0.4], "\"A generation of right-wing populists [] have risen to power in democracies like Turkey [] have coincided, at least at first, with periods of solid economic performance[].

I also don't think Hungary is quite at the stage where Orban could easily just write his own result (Freedom House has Hungary as \"partly free\" currently).
