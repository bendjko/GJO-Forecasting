The following is a rough transcription of the interview. \"Press TV: How much hope should there be in any peace talks considering the conditions of course are long-lasting ceasefire and access to aid? \"Colmain: Well, the question of access to aid is important because the French are emphasizing the necessity of getting aid into Syria. That means nothing of course. When the French government talks about sending aid into countries where it has waged proxy wars, what it actually means is providing safe zones for the delivery of arms. The whole humanitarian corridor rhetoric was invented by Bernard Kouchner in the 1960s, when France was waging a proxy war in Nigeria and they used to bring in weapons there in ambulances, disguised as humanitarian aid. \"So, the French concerns about the humanitarian aid mean absolutely nothing. \"And the second point that I\u2019d like to make is that the French have been the root of this war, they are one of the main belligerents. And the French have been very very active on the ground in Syria, aiding the terrorists. There have been French special forces on the ground in Syria. French special forces were arrested by the Syrian army in 2012. \"So, the French are up to the neck in this business and they are continuing to supply their ally Saudi Arabia with weapons. The Qataris of course are also being supplied by the French with weapons. In fact, one of the reasons why the French have claimed to be unable to defeat ISIS is because they gave all their weapons to the Saudis and the Saudis are giving them to ISIS. \"So, this is a bit of a farce to suggest that the French are fighting terrorism in Syria, but I think the French are concerned about the successes of the Syrian Arab Army. The Syrian Arab Army has been very well equipped in particular in the last year, a lot of retraining. This is something Assad spoke about a few years ago. He said that they were going to have to retrain the entire army for fourth-generation warfare. They\u2019ve been doing that. The Russians have supplied [them] with magnificent equipment. Iranians have given [them] sophisticated aerial reconnaissance equipment. So, they are now, I think, capable of retaking the country.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  For what it's worth.

For Canada, they have seemingly hung their hat on \"combat mission\" as being their political communication \"defeat-device\" of choice. It's the increasingly frayed and tattered Canadian variant of the \"boots on the ground\" kabuki, and it's still on show in the western government capital nearest to you. It keeps raising its repudiated head. \u201cI\u2019m the expert on what is combat and what is not.\u201d Well, if that is true, then they'd better find another general to command Canadian forces immediately! They should be looking for someone who is an expert \"in\" combat, not an expert on \"what is\" combat. Bottom line: The Liberal government of Canada has reneged upon their pledge to \"end Canada\u2019s combat mission in Iraq and Syria.\" This they have not done, but have instead escalated it. And this is the point, so long as the press allows the issue to remain a discussion of the Yes/No aspect of a deceptively-employed definition, the more relevant issue of the escalation continues inadequately addressed.  There is the much broader, and far more important, issue of basic competency with those who, for political expediency or otherwise, employ such semantic defeat-devices. There must be a reason that explains the discrepancy between use of the lie and use of the truth in political communication. Personally, I think it's a surprisingly successful method of escaping accountability as to the magnitude of a policy. If the discussion remains centered on whether the policy is true or not, the issue of the magnitude or extent of the policy remains neglected. What's interesting, is that this \"cost of deception benefit,\" the cost that those who do this kabuki dance are willing to pay to achieve the benefit they seek by employing deception is diffused and borne by the entire political system. Each and every Canadian citizen that recognizes the defeat-device for what it is loses respect for the entire Canadian government just one bit (more). They are trading trust in government generally away for what? An ability to escape accountability on troop escalation? This is not a good trade, and therefore their competence as leaders is called into question. It'd be better to say something along the lines of: the situation has changed, we see ISIS on the verge of collapse, and we believe Canadian troops can help make the difference in ending this tragedy that has dragged on far too long already. OK, great. So how many troops are we talking about? \u201cThey\u2019re increasing the combat role\u201d\n\"the total number of Canadian military personnel, including a logistics base in Kuwait, additional advisers and officers in Baghdad, will grow to at least 830 from the current level of about 650\"\nhttp://www.hilltimes.com/news/2016/02/19/uss-positive-tweets-on-canadas-new-mission-against-isil-show-feds-increasing-combat-role/45339 This ongoing mission and the country it represents would benefit from increased transparency.\nhttp://www.winnipegfreepress.com/opinion/analysis/is-it-combat-or-not-369518412.html My point exactly.

It is the foisting of semantic confusion upon the group that while able to be rejected by those so-inclined to reflect upon it, places an unnecessary cognitive burden upon the entire group. It is saying, in effect, \"I do not care about your ability to reason correctly in your life,\" and as demonstration of this \"I will place this semantic object as an obstacle to your good reasoning.\" It's just very poor taste and very bad manners by someone.

We have a two-step forecast: 1) Will the troops be deployed? and, if so 2) Will deployment be credibly reported? Because I believe the coalition is building to a major offensive campaign (which I also believe focuses the French upon Syria), and I believe the \"best practice\" is always to allow a period of reconnaissance, intelligence gathering, and acclimation, I have been leaning towards \"Yes\" as to the first part of the two-step process. [Edit: And for those who suggest that French SF may have already been there, I would suggest an increased tempo and scope as to their activities.] I could place some probability on the first step, but taking Le Drian's \"hint\" as a confirmation, and for computational simplicity, I'm just going to assume it to be \"yes.\" The aforementioned is just a long way of saying we are faced with forecasting the probability that these (assumed to be) deployed troops will be reported upon. This is challenging because, except for very rare glimpses, it is a controlled information environment.\n- French \"long-standing policy of never discussing the deployment of its elite troops.\" Certainly an excellent operational security policy and one that would likely be respected by the vast majority of Western news sources and outlets.\n+ The assumption that LeDrian is sophisticated enough to recognize that even a \"hint\" is a violation of that policy, which therefore requires the additional assumption that LeDrian had some sufficient reason to violate that policy. Would the desire to generate a signal of coalition solidarity be sufficient reason? Is there some perceived need to demonstrate some active effort to a domestic audience? Perhaps this reason, whatever it may be, will continue.\n+ There are some reputable non-Western sources and outlets who may have an independent interest in the report; which can only now be enhanced by, perhaps, the professional ambition of some intrepid journalist to pop the \"hint\" bubble that Le Drian has created.\n- The nature of the activities are covert, often in \"the dark\" both figuratively and literally. Not a lot of free-floating witnesses who don't have their back turned to the action as they are running away. Also, maybe the \"hint\" indicates the French SF are embedded within some U.S. SF group(s), making distinctive identification difficult.\n+/- The one perhaps relevant incident we have is that of a Canadian special force contingent. No news was generated by this contingent until they were placed under a crazy banzai-like attack (my description) by ISIL. If ISIL really is feeling the pressure, it is possible the frequency of such \"crazy\" attacks might increase, thus perhaps drawing attention to a French SF contingent. I don't think we can count on any \"random\" reporter or event to deliver a confirmation. I'm willing to continue to ride high on this, however, because I'm thinking that whatever the reason Le Drian had to break silence, may continue to exist in the future. There are all possible reasons. Maybe a trial balloon to get the feel for the reaction of the French public. Maybe a message to allies that France is doing their part and they should step up. Maybe a signal to Russia and Iran that they are \"publicly\" committed (although I'm sure the Russians and Iranians already knew if they were covertly committed). In short, it's very risky to be forecasting a strong \"yes\" on the second step. The situation is very far from being able to say \"If they're there, they will be found out and publicly reported.\""], [12874, "2016-01-20T23:18:29Z", [0.15], ""], [306, "2016-01-20T23:16:49Z", [0.5], "Ok, so it's \"tongue and cheek\" confirmed that French Special Forces are already operating in Syria (alongside the U.S. Special Forces).

What I will address, however, are those that, perhaps after some observable, or in some other retroactive fashion, might seek to claim that the question hinges on the interpretation of \"to fight.\" Here, I would suggest that no distinction should be made between a trainer and a fighter. A fighter uses a gun to fight. A trainer uses a fighter to fight. They're both just tools.

Germany and the U.S. will definitely have troops in there. Some are already there.  Canada already pledged to help France.

The French military and the French budget were stretched prior to the Paris attacks. The French military is operating in various parts of the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. In order for the French to increase their military engagements in the Syrian conflict and secure its own population, Hollande made clear that the European Union\u2019s \u201csecurity pact now prevails over the stability pact.\u201d In parallel, Hollande announced that French defense reductions would be cancelled until 2019. By cancelling the defense reductions, France will likely violate the European Union\u2019s budgetary rules. (Given the recent Greek budget crisis, there seems to be some sort of irony here.)\nPrior to setting any further ground operations in motion, France needs other members of the European Union to share some of the burden and the costs of security. Unfortunately, given the migrant crisis in Europe, along with disagreements among member states about security obligations, it seems unlikely France will receive the relief it seeks anytime soon. Therefore, Hollande's declaration of \"war\" does not appear to include the deployment of combat troops in either Syria or Iraq.  The probability of a \u201cyes\u201d outcome here seems low.  What would lead to a \u201cyes?\u201d outcome:  1.\tAnother ISIS attack on French soil and/or an attack on a key ally or EU member state In broad terms, by invoking Article 42.7, Hollande seeks to build a EU coalition sympathetic to its aims which include: sharing the cost of counter-terrorism within the borders of the EU, expanded intelligence among member states, receiving military relief from member states for various global operations, and establishing a leadership role in designing a diplomatic solution for the Syrian Civil war. As many experts believe, the defeat of ISIS is contingent on finding a political solution in Syria. In terms of Iraq, unless the Iraqi government extends an invitation to France to bring ground troops onto its territory, any such French deployment would not be considered based on issues of sovereignty.   I don\u2019t see how analyzing previous French military engagements (in terms of how many over X number of years) takes us very far in establishing a probability for this question. For one thing, history does play a role in each decision to engage military ground operations on foreign soil. The nature of each military engagement differs based on its unique historical context.  Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to calculate estimates of the probability of future military engagements based on data from previous decades.  Moreover, The French colonial wars of the 20th century included a failed attempt to keep Syria under its power. It should be remembered it took 10 years after a negotiated settlement for Syrian nationalists to force the evacuation of French troops from Syria. That was 1946. If Hollande were to send French forces to fight on Syrian soil, these remembrances would likely be used as evidence of the West\u2019s penchant for colonial reprises. Regardless of the fact that such an accusation has little merit, the charge fits in with a narrative conducive to extremist ideology (ISIS).  All that said, at this point, the likelihood of the French sending troops into Syria or Iraq seems unlikely in the short term. As other commentators have noted, with another attack on French or European soil, the probability would very likely go in the other direction very quickly.  Like the situation in Europe, the question requires constant vigilance in deciding the final outcome. \n"], [1529, "2015-12-11T15:59:33Z", [0.2], ""], [241, "2015-12-11T14:33:00Z", [0.15], ""], [73, "2015-12-11T13:35:28Z", [0.15], ""], [12490, "2015-12-11T12:03:09Z", [0.08], "I count 24 separate interventions by the FL since 1945, so I start with a baseline of a new intervention every 2.9 years, or 33% in any one year.

One exception might be an enhanced \"training\" mission, similar to what Canada new role may look like there.\n- If they want to do the same in Syria, they'll need a safe place to base them, and then the question is where; they'd either need to explicitly cooperate with Assad (they've been adamant that he has to go), or invade via Turkey. I can't see them doing the latter without a UN Security Council mandate, and a lot of backup in kind from other NATO countries. The only possibility I can see would be (as others have said) small groups of special forces.

I think there are two ways this resolves to yes: (a) Major (MAJOR) terror attack in a NATO country by ISIS, and/or other huge troubling development (ISIS gets a WMD, takes bigger swath of territory, etc) (b) France deploys their special forces division alongside US, and potentially others (Germany, the UK, Turkey, etc). ____________________ On (a) I don't have a sophisticated methodology for %-chance, but I'm willing to say it is a long shot that this happens in time for France to deploy troops by April.  Clearly Paris and San Bernardino were horrible, but not bad enough to trigger it.  Would probably take something 9/11-esque (maybe not even then?)  I'll call it 5% chance over the 4 months, and I think that is probably too high. It's definitely non-zero though, and over a long enough window of time maybe even probable... I'm much more worried about (b) (wrt this qn resolving as yes).  It appears there may be some chance French special forces (called BFST I believe) will be sent in in very small numbers.  The BFST is part of the French army, and so I assume would count towards this question. To start, the US has apparently asked France to send them in: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-will-urge-france-and-turkey-to-put-special-forces-in-syria/ Germany is also on the verge of sending its troops in (\"in support of france\" albeit it sounds like these are not \"combat troops\"): http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/12/05/440475/Germany-Daesh-Syria-special-forces--  I can find no stories about France mulling the deployment of the BFST with quotes from a French official, but the unit has been sent in in the past to Afghanistan and other places, and would seem plausible/logical that they may be deployed alongside a NATO special forces unit if that is the strategy here (air strikes + special forces + political pressure). I think if we see this question resolved in the affirmative, it's more probable that (b) will be how it happens.  That said, I do not think it is likely.  It's been nearly a month since Paris attacks and I can find no evidence of a french official discussing it as a possibility, and in fact Hollande's quote on the matter is \"france will not intervene militarily on the ground.\"  I'll give it 10% chance and note I'd expect it to be a small number if it happens (<200).
