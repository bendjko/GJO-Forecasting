I'd see this an optimistic reduction and would require tougher restrictions than trump has suggested he's willing to sanction.  EU incidence is on the rise and currently at 10k working out at 2.5 per 100k population. Following trend and presuming the trend gathers pace (as seen before) this would look like 4 in sept, 7 in Oct, 10 on 1st November. I think the EU have a better track record of slowing the spread so would not expect the trend to reach these heights.  Both of these suggest that the US will still have a higher case rate per 100k by 1st November implying which will not match the EU criteria. At face value this implies 100% not before 1st November.  The main thing which could reduce this is if the EU relax their criteria for economic reasons. I think this is plausible, but would still require a big drop in new cases in the US. The EU may face internal pressure when transatlantic business remains difficult after the summer holidays. Moves the dial 10% to October, 5% to September.  If a vaccine is approved and administered in the US this would drastically increase the chances, however this is almost impossible in September and highly unlikely by October, 2% to October.

It's true that states can take it upon themselves to do the right thing, but Trump's federal level failures will undermine the effort and Republican governers, petrified at taking on Democrats in the next election with the ire of Trump's hard core base, will help Trump sabotage America's response. So it is very unlikely the US will hand over the control of the virus to competent people and keep Trump's complaints rhetorical only.
