UK cases are currently ~ 55k, with an increase of ~ 4k per day. If this continues, you comfortably exceed 145. But many (many) adjustments: 1. Cumulative case curves are typically sigmoid, and the now linear-ish trend would suggest we're around the inflexion point. If so, roughly doubling from nowish gives you a number 80-120kish. 2. However, it is probably only sigmoid given containment strategy, so there's some chance of this being inadvertently or deliberately relaxed, which could further push up the numbers.  3. Testing. I take this to be the principal uncertainty - I guess there have already been 145k infections in the UK (and certainly will have been by Jun 1) - the question is how many end up being recognised and reported. Briefly: * We saw large 'steps' in reported cases when China switched for a time to clinical case definitions. However, cumulative curves seen elsewhere do not show (to my knowledge) large surges of cases attributable to testing. I suspect partly because these surges happen after containment has already kicked in, and mild/asymptomatic cases in the community tend not to be sought (and prioritized below HCWs, patients, etc.) * Current tests assess (roughly) current infection, and not past ones. Also reagents are short worldwide, so it remains unclear whether the UK will hit 100k tests a day soon. * Antibody tests may be implemented soonish, and their widespread deployment could reveal thousands of seroconversions. Yet seroconversion does not demonstrate a current infection, and thus it is unclear to me whether this would 'count' as a case for reporting purposes. There's also a question of if (e.g.) there's a rollout of 'home test kits' whether there would be attempts to gather the 'positives' and report them.   Trying to weigh this up, I'm much more cautious than the crowd. Perhaps they know something I don't.

The UK data seems a bit sketchier than some countries making the forecast a bit riskier, as does the relatively short period since the jump in case counts: We didn't hit 3000 until 6 days ago. What argues for a high estimate is the recent history of spain, italy, and france. They will all be over 145K by the deadline, but the current UK count is significantly lower in spite of its being as large or larger than those countries and not responding quickly or well. The UK's testing has lagged even the US in tests per million people. On the other hand, UK is promising a big increase in testing which should push numbers up as it rolls out, even if it decreases them later.  Also, the remaining period is sufficiently long that we can't rule out entirely some clinical or epidemiological innovation that impacts the case count positively.  The most likely course is continued growth in the UK daily case numbers as testing increases.

Arguments for a high number:\n- From the number of cases as well as deaths it looks like the UK is lagging Italy by around 2 weeks. Similary, the lock-down of the UK was implented at a similar stage of the exponential curve as Italy. Therefore, extrapolating using the Italian data we get to above 80k cases over the next 2 weeks for the UK (using Johns Hopkins data). The WHO data is consistently a bit lower than Johns Hopkins but this should rule out the first two answer possibilities very firmly. Given that even with a lock-down the growth rate takes time to stabilize (Italy still has 6k new cases per day recently) staying below 105k cases also seems very unlikely.\n- Further following the Italian data thought experiment if we assume that the current (27 March) growth rate of new cases drops by 0.5% per day until it reaches 1% and then with 0.1% per day until it hits zero on 19 April Italy will still have reached 147k cases by then; UK being two weeks behind would get to that number end of April/beginning of May then\n- Even if the lock-down is successful, this will be followed by a period when the lock-down is lifted (even if slowly) where there will be new infections, which in upside scenario should be held in check via tests and contact tracing, however still leading to continuous low number of new infections (in South Korea ~100 per day)\n- Furthermore, the UK government is working on introducing antibody tests which would reveal who was infected without having been testet. Assuming this is implemented before June (likely if the tests work) then the cases should spike substantially (assuming they will count towards the WHO cases which in turn is uncertain)\n- Also any increase in testing capacities would likely lead to even higher numbers Arguments for lower number:\n- testing in UK is not done very thoroughly. Government instruction to people is that everyone who has symptoms (fever, cough) should self isolate for 7 days and not contact the authorities unless the situation worsens significantly.

Its worth also noting that some articles have suggested that a high number of the UK may already have had the virus and there is a consensus that the worst may be over by easter. A factor will be how quick the R0 number drops below 2 which depends on a lot of variables such as peak.  It is likely that Britain is not as far as 14 days behind Italy as some have predicted.
