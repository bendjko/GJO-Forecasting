In particular, using data from late 2017 would introduce a lot of volatility that is probably not representative. Data from https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin 2) Estimate average % change in daily price and standard deviation. 3) Use these parameters to build a distribution (normal assumed) of future % daily changes.  4) Use this distribution to develop a pathway for the price over time (140 days since BTC trades every day) 5) Repeat step 4) 10,000 times 6) Tabulate frequencies of buckets Interestingly, it matters whether one uses the historical average or an average of 0 for the future distribution. Will BTC continue its 2018 trend? Or is it oversold and will it reverse? Assuming an average of 0 leads to 1%, 44%, 36%, 12% and 7% in the buckets respectively. Using the historical (0.3% daily drop) results in: 7, 67, 21, 4, 1. As a middle of the road assumption, I halved the average drop and used that.
