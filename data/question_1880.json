It's possible that kids returning to school could cause a new spike.  However, studies generally show that kids do not transmit the disease, so I don't think this is going to cause a major spike.  Second, if you look at the states that are still >10% positive per test, those same states also have lower infection rates.  Third, the CDC has been making more statements about the need to \"double-mask\" whenever possible, so it seems like that is probably helping to minimize transmission as well. Also, it seems clear based on the NY Times article that there have been two clear \"cycles\" for COVID positivity.  The first was the initial hump in the Spring of 2020 and the second was the Christmas holiday.  Using history as a lense through which to predict the future, as suggested by Richard E. Neustadt and Ernest R. May (Thinking In Time: the Uses Of History For Decision Makers)  or William Strauss and Neil Howe (The Fourth Turning: an American Prophecy) it seems like we may still have one more hump to hit.

If the vaccine is rolled out, people will be less likely get tested because they will assume they have immunity.  Only those that are REALLY sick will get tested. Regarding the number of 15 states, is where we exist right now on 31 January higher, lower, or in line with history?  This site provides some REALLY good historical data, but it will take to dig through it: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/ After going through the JHU website, I did a quick glance to divide states into one of three categories:  1) a state that has consistently been >10%, 2) a state that has flopped above and below 10%, 3) states that have consistently been below 10%. After doing that, I came up with 14 consistently above 10%, 15 that bounce above and below, and 22 that have been consistently less than 10%.

The source referenced in the question (COVID ActNow) determines the \u201cPositive Test Rate\u201d as the number of tests administered \u00f7 the number of positive tests, both as reported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  This definition is significant because it only includes people who choose to get tested, not the state\u2019s total population.  Assuming the COVID virus does not dramatically mutate over the next four weeks, we should expect roughly the same percentage of people who test will come back positive.  Therefore, my outside view remains the same as the current level: 15 states. Inside View Adjustments:\nNational Trend Data.  Using the same HHS dataset, the national average (average of all state\u2019s positivity rate) is 8.4% with a standard deviation of 3.7%.  According to the CDC, the national two-week average positive test rate is 11%, down from 12% for the previous two-week average (I could not find this data from HHS).  There are four weeks before the end of the forecast period.  Assuming the HHS state-level positive rate data follows the CDC\u2019s national trend, positive test rates would drop 1% every two weeks.  This would lower the HHS average to 6.4% by 1 March.  Assuming a distribution similar to the current data, I would still expect 13 states to report a positive test rate above 10%. Vaccinations.  The U.S. administered the first COVID vaccination on 14 December 2020.  After some initial logistical issues, by mid-January, 900,000 Americans received the COVID vaccine each day (roughly 0.27% of the US population).  Even after receiving the vaccine, patients can still contract the virus and test positive for up to 28 days.  However, individuals who receive the vaccine are probably much less likely to get a COVID test within the four weeks after vaccination.  This is likely already contributing to the 1% per two-week decline noted in the CDC data.

Data I\u2019ve found at the national level show positivity rates from about 8.7 to 9.3, depending on the source. The trend shows a national peak just after the new year of 13.7 positivity rate, followed by a reasonably steep decline. At this time it looks like the curve is settling out. Based on the trend data, my estimate is for about a 1% decrease in the positivity rate by March 1. Inside View: Although the vaccine is rolling out, this should not affect the positive rate much, as it is rolling out slowly, and primarily to elderly or at risk americans. Perhaps the overall positivity rate drops as much as .5% due to the vaccine and people who may be more likely to contract covid having antibodies. Next, as more of the population, especially those who are vulnerable, have had COVID, there is a smaller population that doesn\u2019t have covid antibodies. One article I\u2019ve read suggests as many as 1/3 Americans have COVID antibodies. Finally, I don\u2019t see many more lockdowns being put in place, and the weather is still forcing many indoors during winter, so I am discounting these factors from a large impact on the overall positivity rate. Synthesis: Between the outside view and inside view, my synthesis estimate is for an overall decrease nationally in the positivity rate of 2%. Although imperfect, a decrease in 2% of the positivity rate would mean 6 less states above 10%. Thus my estimate is for 16 states with a positivity rate of 10% or more.

On new variants, the British and South African mutations are, apparently, not more dangerous but a lot more contagious. Also, given how quickly they spread, we should consider a new, unknown variant as a possibility in the US, changing trends and increasing positivity rates.\nOn vaccines, how will rates move as more citizens are vaccinated? Some data can be taken from [2], but the program started so rencently that we cannot have any meaningful projections on results, not even for Israel [3] or Bahrain [4], the top 2 countries (not that they are comparable by population or density).\nAnyway, two months might be a too short time to implement a huge logistic program like this and have improvements in the rate.\nCombining negatives and lack of time to see results from positive, I move from 8 to 15 and 22.
