It is possibly a blueprint for an ongoing increasing polarization IN GENERAL  of NI voters between extreme unionism (represented by the UUP) and active national separatism (represented by Sinn Fein) on the other pole. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election#Distribution_of_seats_by_constituency ) \n However, Fermanagh and South Tyrone does have some particularities:\n/Seats that were formerly occupied by SDLP have been won by Sinn Fein in the past (first in 1975, then again in 2011)\n/Seats on the unionist side are heavily contested between UUP and DUP, one seat of the UUP turned DUP through the party defection of the MLA Arlene Isabel Foster in 2004 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster#Assembly_career ). She used to be a high-profile MLA ever since until the RHIgate ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Heat_Incentive_scandal ) triggered by her seriously distorted NI politics for years, until the New Decade, New Approach (NDNA) agreement was found ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Decade,_New_Approach ). Despite the scandal, her seat remained with the DUP in the 2017 election and was gained by MLA Deborah Erskine.\n/Amazingly, Foster survived the scandal politically thoughout the \"Collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive\" 2016 through 2020 and even Brexit ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster#Northern_Ireland_political_deadlock,_2017%E2%80%932020 , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_(Executive_Formation_etc)_Act_2019 )and even became First Minister in 2020 again. It remains to be seen how voters will judge Foster publicly  tying her political career to such unfortunate figures as Theresa May and Boris Johnson in the Brexit matters. /The \"Irish Language Act\" was a big political win for all nationalist parties involved when introduced through the NDNA agreement ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Language_Act ), it is likely to remind voters of the Unionists parties' weakness in their everyday life ahead of the next election and could enforce a realistic separatist movement.\n/Moreover, Fermanagh and South Tyrone is, by its long border with the Republic of Ireland, likely one the constituencies most exposed to post-BREXIT border troubles on the Irish island, which may influence the sentiment towards the central UK government and the Unionist ideology significantly. /As a conclusion, the UUP is likely to lose their only remaining seat in Fermanagh and South Tyrone to the DUP, whereas the DUP, as a consequence of the Foster legacy, may lose the other seat to moderate nationalist voters.\nIn sum, and ceteris paribus, Sinn Fein may turn out strongest with at least 28 seats, while UUP is in further decay along with the DUP winning 28 seats or less.\n/Considering MLAs not seeking re-election ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election#Members_not_seeking_re-election )\nthe most likely changes observed will happen in\nLagan Valley, where Ind. MLA Trevor Lunn's seat is for grabs likely to Sinn Fein and\nSouth Down, where SDLP MLA Sin\u00e9ad Bradley's seat could also be contested by either Sinn Fein or UUP.\nOther vacant seats without incumbent are likely to remain with the respective party's new contestant. Unless party arithmetics are newly riffled by the formation of formal party alliances/voting blocks, Sinn F\u00e9in is likely to be the party winning most seats in May 2022.\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/dup-battling-back-but-sinn-feins-michelle-oneill-still-on-course-for-first-minister-41047391.html"], [22147, "2021-12-11T08:22:01Z", [0.55, 0.23, 0.22], "Fixed calculation.

While Sinn Fein is in opposition due to coalition of Fianna Fail, Fine Gael, and the Green Party, it appears to remain a strong political movement with little negative press, scandal, or problems. An additional factor that will impact this election will be how Protocol 16 of Brexit is handled by the UK government. DUP and other unionists have seen their position and preference consistently undermined by UK parliament as the focus has been on securing territorial and customs protections for UK. This has caused a 'soft' customs and border arrangement to be implemented across the Irish Sea to prevent reinstatement of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. To date Brexit implementation has come at the cost of Northern Ireland unionist positions and it doesn't appear there is political will or power to change the balance. This should further undermine DUP. Base rate would say slight edge to Sinn Fein based on trend, district analysis, and larger Republic of Ireland success for Sinn Fein.  I will attribute 2% noise to potential resurgence of UUP if DUP implodes in response to Brexit or potential scandal.  SDLP might have also have a resurgence however that seems very unlikely due to trend of SDLP in Republic of Ireland."], [34815, "2021-12-04T11:26:16Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [103108, "2021-12-04T10:16:59Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05], "The DUP has won 5/6 elections since 1998.
