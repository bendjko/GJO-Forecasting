The results swayed me a bit. I am basing the following off the Presidential election, even though I know some of the voters likely did not vote along party lines for the Senate. I did compare the total numbers of votes for each party, and they were fairly close to the presidential election numbers, with some votes going to 3rd party candidates which likely makes up the difference, so I am assuming the results for the runoff will be closer to the results for the Presidential election in a 50/50 race. Here is what I found: Democrats will have \u02dc90,000 new registered voters who will reach voting age between 3 November and 5 Jan, and many have registered for mail in ballots (Republicans will have new voters as well, so this may be moot). \u02dc1,200,000 absentee ballots requested. \u02dc1,600,000 million requested during 3 Nov election. \u02dc1,300,000 mail in ballots returned during 3 Nov elections, 65% of which were for Biden \u02dc845,000 Dem \u2013 \u02dc455,000 Rep. (This accounts for \u02dc81.5% of the requested mail in ballots being returned). Democrats received \u02dc400,000 more absentee ballot votes than Republicans in Nov 3 election.  \u02dc250,000 ballots already returned for runoff elections. Bernard Fraga, an Emory University professor who studies voting, said it\u2019s possible that mail-in ballots, if anything, will be even more favorable for Democrats in the runoff because of attacks on the integrity of mail-in voting by President Donald Trump and many Georgia Republicans. However, it can reasonably be expected that at least 65% are for Democrats, which would be \u02dc162,500 Dem \u2013 \u02dc87,500 Rep.  If no additional mail in ballots are requested (they can be requested until 1 Jan), and approximately the same amount of ballots are returned, we can reasonably expect to see similar numbers in the runoffs, with \u02dc65% of the returned ballots voting for Democrats. Similar numbers of mail in ballots returned, if at 81.5% of those requested, would be \u02dc978,000 out of the current \u02dc1,200,000. This would mean that \u02dc635,000 would be for Dems and \u02dc342,000 for Reps. More than half of the record 5 million votes in the Nov. 3 general election were cast during its three-week early voting period. The final vote count was 2,461,854 Rep - 2,473,633 Dem Rep in-person vote 2,461,854-\u02dc455,000 (mail in)= \u02dc2,006,854.  Dem in-person vote 2,473,633-\u02dc845,000 (mail in)= \u02dc1,628,633  Out of the total \u02dc3,635,847 total in-person votes, \u02dc55% were Rep votes, and \u02dc45% were Dem votes. Early in-person voting could be even more important in the Jan. 5 runoffs because of the short period for voters to request and return ballots by mail. The first two days seem to be slower than the elections on 3 November, but still a record turnout for a runoff. It is reasonable to assume that more Democrats will vote in-person during the runoffs, not only due to the short timeline for requesting and returning ballots, but also to ensure that their votes count if there is any litigation over mail in ballots in the future, so it is slightly possible that the in-person voting could be more of a 50/50 split instead of the \u02dc55/45 seen on 3 Nov if the Reps have a similar split between mail in and in-person. IF this is not the case, and less Reps vote by mail, then the election results depend greatly on how many Republicans show up to vote in-person to mitigate the potential increase in percentage of Dems voting in-person and any increase in mail in votes that go the Dems way. I believe that many voters will show up for both sides, as a win for the Democrats would mean full control over the Executive branch, and Republicans want to stop that. However, the turnout will not be as good as the November election, as seen already. Also, with the President still saying that the elections were rife with fraud, and still tweeting that the Governor of Georgia should open a special session to verify signatures on ballots in an attempt to overturn the 3 November results, it could affect Republican turnout. According to multiple sources, \u201cThe president\u2019s repeated attacks on election integrity could have undermining effects on efforts to mobilize Republican voters for the Jan. 5 runoffs.\u201d President Trump tweeted this today: \u201c\u201cWhat a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way,\u201d Trump said on Twitter early Monday morning. \u201cDemand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.\u201d A lot of Rep voters believe the election is already decided, as the Dominion voting machines are flawed, and there is no sense in voting in an election where the winner is already decided. Will they still show up? Likely not in full force, but many will in case there is litigation to void the mail in results or hopes that the state conducts a hand count. Tweets coming from the current President, such as the one above, only work to cement that belief in those that truly believe that the election results were not accurate, and serves to reduce any potential that some of these voters would turn out anyway despite that belief. However, turnout on the Dem side will also be lower due to the belief that one does not need to vote because the rest of the voters will do their part and ensure the Dems win. There are also groups that believe boycotting the election is the way to go. While this is not the majority, even losing some of the Republican votes in Georgia to boycotting could put the election in the favor of the Democrats, with such a small margin to work with. If the mail in voting goes the same as the last election, the Republicans will need a 66% margin in in-person voting to counter the 65% margin Dems could have from mail in votes. With the polls indicating that both Democratic candidates are now narrowly favored to win, and a combination of lower turnout and potentially increased Democratic in-person voting, it is hard to say that the Democrats will not take both runoffs. However, if you go by odds alone, there is a 25% chance the Democrats will win both, and a 75% chance the Republicans will win just one. The above information would seem to state the opposite, but with the polls indicating such a narrow margin, I would have to give a bit more weight to the odds for now. However, as a better picture of the mail in ballot returns and early in-person voter turnout develops, I may be swayed to lean more on the side of the Democrats winning both runoffs.

Thus, the remaining two special senate races in Georgia are the determinants of this issue as the current balance in the senate will be 46(D) - 50 (R) - 2 (I) [Note the I's caucus with Democrats). The presidential election showed local races still favor the GOP in historically GOP areas (for example Maine), but that the President underperformed local candidates in many areas except when a large Latino population was present (Maine, Georgia). Presidential elections also see higher turnout which generally favors republicans.  Loeffler is an unpopular candidate and may lose her reelection (or is it still reelection if you were never elected in the first place?), but Purdue seems unlikely to lose as an incumbent. Further, given that Perdue's failure to secure 50% of the vote in the previous election seems to have been due to a Libertarian candidate (Shane Hazel) and his challenger his fairly socially progressive with respect to Georgia at large. Nevertheless, polls show both senate races in a dead heat (with Perdue slightly ahead of Ossoff and Loeffler tied or slightly behind Warnock), but given that polls have been slightly biased against republicans and democrats have to flip both seats to gain the senate this seems unlikely. I would estimate that the base rate odds of a dead heat race for both are 50-50, but given that Republicans only need one win that is a 25% - 75% ratio for R-D.

Both sides will be highly motivated, but Democrats, led by Stacey Abrams, will likely be better organized and will again vote early in bigger numbers than Republicans. Georgia has an interesting history of runoffs that have generally favored Republicans, but the recent results are indicating a possible shift in the blue direction. https://insideelections.com/news/article/a-brief-history-of-georgia-runoffs-and-why-this-time-may-be-different\n"], [96556, "2020-11-20T07:51:32Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97038, "2020-11-20T04:58:25Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97036, "2020-11-20T03:21:21Z", [0.21, 0.7, 0.03, 0.06], ""], [84880, "2020-11-20T00:44:49Z", [0.09, 0.91, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97037, "2020-11-19T23:49:14Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97037, "2020-11-19T23:42:44Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97036, "2020-11-19T23:29:19Z", [0.21, 0.7, 0.03, 0.06], ""], [22689, "2020-11-19T22:19:32Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-11-19T20:56:44Z", [0.16, 0.84, 0.0, 0.0], "https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/17271"], [97032, "2020-11-19T20:54:34Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [422, "2020-11-19T14:49:14Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [422, "2020-11-19T14:47:50Z", [0.01, 0.99, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [88553, "2020-11-19T14:47:32Z", [0.22, 0.78, 0.0, 0.0], "\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/georgias-runoffs-will-determine-control-of-the-senate-heres-what-we-know-so-far/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/18/democrats-please-think-twice-before-invading-georgia-help-with-senate-runoffs/\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/06/what-are-odds-democratic-wins-georgia-runoffs/"], [97026, "2020-11-19T14:29:29Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29054, "2020-11-19T14:02:07Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95068, "2020-11-19T12:40:04Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "interesting times"], [97021, "2020-11-18T23:10:04Z", [0.2, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [92786, "2020-11-18T22:15:22Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-11-18T20:23:23Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-11-18T20:19:12Z", [0.24, 0.76, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2020-11-18T19:22:32Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], "-15% to Dems House/Senate, +15% to Dems/Repubs House/Senate"], [1333, "2020-11-18T19:08:21Z", [0.02, 0.98, 0.0, 0.0], "The disarray in the Georgia S of S office causes to wonder if this will be a stolen election or not."], [14027, "2020-11-18T18:55:11Z", [0.07, 0.93, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [92379, "2020-11-18T18:53:43Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [61231, "2020-11-18T18:10:11Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], "One of the Georgia seats will most likely go to the Republicans making them the majority, both going to the Democrat's is highly unlikely.

I see no scenario likely where the DNC takes the senate and the republicans take the House. It's possible, of course, but I'm not going to wager on it.  That eliminates the 3&4th options.  The senate is complicated. I've seen both statistical and specific argument that could go either way.

From what I have read there have been very few corrections or eliminations of these seriously skewed gerrymandered districts. Certainly not enough have been 'fixed' for equality in time to make a difference in the 11/3/2020 election. One implication of this is that this provides a 'built in skew' favoring Republicans. On the other hand the stunning divisiveness created, broadcast and implemented in policies, funding and speeches throughout what I think is the entirety of the Republican party as well as their elected officials does two things. 1) It puts a lot of 'traditional Republicans' (ones that do not 'drink the Kool Aid' of Fox and other talking heads and groups claiming to be 'true Republicans') looking for an alternative candidate to get some 'normalcy' back into the party. 2. It is my hope that it riles up (for lack of a better term) enough marginalized (by the policies, funding and speeches) people to get out and vote for what they think is the best person for the government positions on the ballets! There is a huge amount of issues, statements, policies and disregard of values, morals, ethics, laws, etc performed by the Republicans across the board that it might seem to be a  slam dunk case of ousting Republicans in order to make things better.  And yes, there are Democratic officials that have done stupid and horrible things and they need to be ousted as well. I think there should be focus brought to such topics while providing information about how this wrong, injustice, problem will be fixed by 'candidate x'. In some cases I would be all for classifying some issues such as of what I perceive as planned hindering of COVID-19 responses, information and related deaths along with racial injustices as being government sanctioned genocide to drive the point home about why what is occurring is wrong, why it needs to be fixed and how to fix it or at least make it much better. It is my view that the only way to deal with the gerrymandering that is in place today and increasing the odds of a regime change is to get topics highlighted to the point where they can not be ignored, need to be dealt with and alternatives sought. People need to be outraged. Basically need to make everyone feel that their one vote is a life and death decision for themselves and the rest of the country. We need to improve our government and deal with the issues we face. I fear that the world populations and related government groups will totally crumble when the reality of climate change and ALL of the ripple effects of it are understood and believed. The mass migrations of people and resulting social and economic upheaval will be stunning. We are ill prepared for it. There is no 'alternative planet', let alone facts.

I assign a higher probability to Dems having House and Reps winning senate than either winning the other for this reason. I haven't looked into how many elections this cycle are competitive and how many competitive elections are faced by each party's incumbents, so i can't give great estimates here. I suspect that democrats have a slight edge in winning elections broadly this cycle since 1) younger generation has a larger percentage of voting than last cycle and they are disproportionately liberal. 2) Economy is currently bad which usually indicates dissatisfaction with current government which is perceived to be republican lead since the president is republican. 3) Older people who are more likely to be conservative are less likely than normal to go vote in person due to coronavirus concerns, though i do not think this is a very big factor.

The senate is harder to predict because there is less gerrymandering involved and it represents a more diverse set of voters per seat. I think because young people are passionate about personal interractions, and because they are upset about losing out on prom and not being able to be around friends as much, they will finally turn out at a decent rate and vote for democratic nominees since most of the blame of the pandemic is being placed on the shoulders of republicans.

However, I follow the site, FiveThirtyEight and have knowledge of some of their predictions and analysis.  I also follow some other news sites (disclosure:  I am not American - I am a Canadian living in Hong Kong).\n3) I assume (based on my reading of news, polls etc) that there is nearly zero chance that Republicans can win the House.  I also assume the fact that Biden is winning in the presidential polls currently means there will be some tendency towards higher Democratic turnout in senate voting.\n4) My base rate is betfair betting market which seems to currently give the Dems a 35-40 percent chance of winning a majority in both houses.  However, again I am assuming here that \u201ccontrol\u201d by Dems could be 50/50 with a Dem VP elected.  For purposes of this question, I give Dems roughly a 65% chance to elect the President VP (which is a bit higher now than, but consistent with, betting markets).\n5) I am also aware of a recent prediction of a FiveThirtyEight analyst that the \u201cbase case\u201d right now is 51+ Dem senators.  So if I average that with the (say) 40% chance as implied by betting markets(which I adjust upwards to 42% based on my own evaluation), I get say 47.5-50% chance of Dem\u2019s having 51+ senators.\n6) I don\u2019t have a clear sense of what are the chances of exactly 50 senators each, but betting markets seem to imply about a 15-20% chance.  Also, I see from Google search that currently, the only independents in the Senate caucus with the Dems, so I am making a simplifying assumption that such independents who caucus with one party can effectively be considered part of that party (ie part of its \"control\").  I also notice the question doesn't seem to allow the possibility of neither party controlling a branch - so I will make no offsetting adjustment for such possibility.\n7) My calculation based on the above gives very close to 60% chance of Dems controlling both houses (ie my choice of 60% is not a rounding to nearest 5 or 10 percent).\n "], [45594, "2020-08-02T07:38:16Z", [0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [86358, "2020-08-02T04:35:50Z", [0.58, 0.34, 0.01, 0.07], ""], [71523, "2020-08-02T02:31:42Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57628, "2020-08-02T02:02:25Z", [0.57, 0.43, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86246, "2020-08-01T21:54:33Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], "Key Republican races are not going well and are chipping away at the Senate's Red Wall.

A generous assessment puts the number of competitive House seats at 66 which sounds promising for Republicans considering they only have to flip 14 seats to win a majority. In practice, however this will prove very difficult. Of the districts up for grabs, only 3 are districts predicted to flip from one party to another and all of them favor Democrats. [1] Let\u2019s look briefly at how this fits into a historical framework Since 1855, only 6 out of 19 (32%) of House majorities have lasted two years. The only two-year majorities to occur in the modern era occurred in 1947-1949 and 1955-1957. Democrats regained control of the House in 1949 after renewed Cold War fears overshadowed then-President Truman\u2019s unpopular economic policies. [2] A recession saw Democrats end a two-year Republican majority as Cold War fears again flared up in the Middle East. [3] This marked the beginning of a 40-year majority. [4] Since the end of that extended period, the average majority has lasted 6.5 years including the current Congress. All things considered, the House is pretty much a lock for Democrats.  Conversely, the Republicans can take heart in the fact that they confront a more favourable Senate picture. It is not without its challenges, however. Gubernatorial appointee Martha McSally faces here first time on the ballot as Senator in a state that has been ravaged by the coronavirus, with many voters laying the blame at the feet of the GOP. Democrat Mark Kelly has a strong lead in the southwestern state. [5] Republicans face fights of varying degrees in five other states including Colorado, where former Governor Mark Hickenlooper leads handsomely. Even with two seats likely trophies for the Democrats, it probably won\u2019t be enough to overturn the four seat deficit necessary to control both chambers.

In Maine, Sarah Gideon is even with Susan Collins in fundraising, the last five polls show Gideon kicking Colins\u2019s butt, and all three pundits rate it a toss up. Collins has some real problems with her Kavanaugh vote, her impeachment vote, and the unearthing of a vote against pandemic funding some time ago. Maine is essentially blue, and in the most recent Presidential polls, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump by 11 points, 53% to 42%. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump by three points, 48% to 45%.  I view those three seats as much more than likely going to the Dems. There are three more GOP seats that are verging on going blue: Iowa, Montana, and North Carolina. And if Kris Kobach wins the GOP primary in Kansas, that seat will be in play, too. I think Donald Trump has shown the country he lacks the leadership skills and the intellectual capacity to deal with the COVID-19 thing in anything like an acceptable manner, and that the COVID-19 situation, along with the economy, will continue to get worse, taking Congressional Republicans in both chambers down with him. So I think the odds of at least a fourth Senate seat flipping to blue are pretty high. So all in all, I think the chances of the Dems flipping four seats is getting higher. And I can\u2019t even imagine that the GOP will take back the House.

Individulas are unpredictable, systems and trends tend to not be. Its very rare for a senate to swing, however, there only needs to be a swing of 3 seats for dems to win which I think is more in the realms of possibility than not. Most estimates on this board havent assessed data regarding the potential levels of varaince in the voter base which could cause this swing. Keep your eyes on yougovs pendulum, average decline of perceived well handling of the pandemic is decreasing by 2% eveyry few days in the US. This is likely to be  huge voting point, the conditions of the pandemics and riots themselves may also be likely to disrupt the vote, which will also affect my forecast updates. combine this with an average global governemnt approvla of about 30% this can be assumed to be fairly constant in its influence on undecided or swing voters. However, a ten point drop in dissaporval only accounts for a change in about 2.3% of vote share with modern UK elections having a poor confidence interval. This combined with the PEW research datas info on dissaproval allowed me to synthesise a potentially changing vote shar of between 4-13.8%. PEW also had good data on opinions, current event perception and qualities of each candidates. Biden looks leading because his insipidness makes him very electable, however, polls suggests most people are using him as a f*** trump vote just like hillary, we saw how that turned out (not to indulge in Gamblers fallacy). finally, comparing these to paddy powers odds I came to the reasonable assumpton that there was an 8 percent variance in the current electorate regarding across the voteshare, mostly favouring dems becuase trump people hate trump more and neutrals hate trump more which still leaves trump with a solid base. I'll be revising the data in line to covid basedd approvals, particularly with mask uptake increasing leading to improvements in the situation as well as the PEW's perception polls. https://yougov.co.uk/topics/international/articles-reports/2020/06/08/international-covid-19-tracker-update-8-june https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/30/publics-mood-turns-grim-trump-trails-biden-on-most-personal-traits-major-issues/ "], [41952, "2020-07-29T09:33:58Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94652, "2020-07-29T04:55:42Z", [0.55, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94652, "2020-07-29T04:50:22Z", [0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0], "polling suggests democrats will win both houses."], [94648, "2020-07-29T03:24:14Z", [0.3, 0.68, 0.01, 0.01], "There is a very Low probability that Republicans will take control of the House so any forecast that contains this is must be almost zero probability.

In recent years, no party has kept the Senate for more than 4 years, with Republicans keeping it on average for 2.67 terms. Over the past 30 elections, the Senate has only flipped five times, but each of those flips has come in the past 16 cycles, meaning the chance of a flip is around 30% in the modern era. However, there have only been six elections in the past 30 years where a swing of more than four seats in either direction ended up changing the majority party, and large swings have become less frequent in recent years. Moreover, recent polling shows Republicans hold more \"safe\" and \"likely\" seats than Democrats, meaning Dems would have to win around 80% of the toss-up/leaning seats to gain the majority without the VP. However, polling has been trending consistently in favor of the Democrats in recent months, meaning that possibility is not negligible.

This is increasingly backfiring as people realize Trump's calls for law and order come under his administration's failure to maintain law and order.\nConsequently, it is unlikely that Republicans will retake the gerrymandered House of Representatives by picking up any marginal districts that were lost in 2018. The possibility of Trump's strategy working is most likely to be found in Republicans retaining Senate seats in \"red states.\" \nThe question of how the votes play-out will depend largely on Joe Biden's actions. Thus far, Biden's strategy has been to let Trump be Trump; and this has led to a legitimate lead for Biden in national polls and apparent leads in state polls across \"battleground states\" and even in to Florida, Texas, and Arizona. If Biden can continue to sail the vast middle channel of the political spectrum with non-controversial policies and a non-controversial pick for vice president, Trump will have to generate momentum internally, and this is something that he has thus far been unable to do in 2020. On the other hand, if Biden has a series of gaffes or controversial policy proposals, these may not sink his chances to be president, but they may tilt Senate races against him and preserve the majority for Republicans.

These are competitive races, and it will cost the GOP to keep these seats.

So Senate control is the real question. Currently, polls (RealClearPolitics/fivethirtyeight) suggest that 46 Senate seats are safe/lean Democratic. 48 Senate seats are safe/lean Republican. That leaves 6 toss up states. So for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate they need either (i) 2 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups AND the Vice Presidency (Trump re-election), OR (ii) 3 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups (and Trump doesn't have to be re-elected). For Democrats to gain control of the Senate they need either (i) 4 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups AND the Vice Presidency (Biden election), OR (ii) 5 Senate seats from the 6 toss ups (and Biden doesn't have to be elected). Given the pandemic, tanking economy, and Trumps corresponding declines in the polls in key swing states (Fla, NC, Mich, etc) I currently give Joe Biden a 75% chance of taking the White House (historically re-election is tied to how the economy is performing at the time of election, and there's record levels of unemployment). When it comes to the 6 toss-up Senate seats (CO, IA, ME, NC, MI, and MT)...I have 4 of them leaning Democratic (my assigned probabilities, given current polls, are CO-D at 95% probability, ME-D at 62% probability, MI-D at 70% probability, and MT-D at 52% probability), with IA and NC being toss-ups (my assigned probabilities, given current polls at 50%-50%). With those assigned probabilities that gives Democrats about a 63% probability of winning 4 of those 6 toss ups. This 63% plus my assigned 75% probability of a Biden victory (meaning a Democratic VP will break ties in the Senate) should then impel me to increase the probability of Democrats taking control of both House and Senate to about 69%. But I've made this a little bit more conservative given two factors: (i) we're still over 4.5 months away from the election (and in a very volatile political/economic moment), and (ii) the Senate doesn't typically change control that often and even usually has a slight Republican/rural bias.

Prior to the emergence of COVID-19 I believe Republicans were well poised to retake control of the House and would most likely have retained control over the Senate. However, because of the COVID-19 outbreak, it's economic impacts and the likelihood of another spike in cases in the fall I believe Republicans will struggled to retake what they otherwise had strong chances of doing.\nThe swing districts Republicans need to retake the House in 2020 are predominately suburban districts, filled with voters who are typically skeptical at best of Trump and Republican rhetoric. These people are often drawn to Republican's economic  and tax platforms and are driven away from Democrats by cultural sentiments against liberalism and a generous welfare state. \nI believe it is most likely that Republican rhetoric on coronavirus and the economic conditions that will most likely exist in Nov. 2020 will compel voters in swing districts to retain their recently elected \"opposition\" representatives. These are citizens who already voted to install \"opposition\" politicians when economic conditions were good, and it seems highly unlikely they would change their minds in favor of Trump/Republicans.  The Senate presents what is certainly a more complex and challenging puzzle. I believe Cory Gardner is all but guaranteed to lose his seat. Likewise I believe there is a better than 75% chance Martha McSally loses her seat in Ariz. especially if Mark Kelly is her opponent. I believe there is also a more than likely probability (around 65%) chance that Susan Collins loses her seat as well. I believe Doug Jones will lose his seat to a Republican in Alabama in 2020 (88% chance of Republican win) leaving Democrats within just one seat of control (if Biden wins election as I believe he will). \nI believe Steve Bullock, if he gets the Democratic nomination in MT, has a strong chance of taking Steve Daines seat (around 66%) and that, depending upon the candidates selected by the parties, Democrats have a reasonable chance to pick up Pat Roberts seat in Kansas (likelihood of goes up significantly if Kris Kobach wins Republican nomination.

McSally is among the top 10 Senators with disapproval ratings by constituents.  Cook rates it a toss up, Sabato leaning Blue. * In Colorado, John Hickenlooper (D) is a popular former governor, and Cory Gardner (R) is among the top 10 Senators with highest disapproval ratings among constituents.  Gardner currently has more money, but Hickenlooper is rapidly closing the gap. Cook rates it a toss up, Sabato leaning Blue. * In Maine, Susan Collins has THE highest disapproval rating of all Senators among constituents.  Sara Gideon (D) is polling neck-and-neck with her, and has actually raised more than Collins.  Plus, there is a $4+ million \"Defeat Collins\" fund waiting for Gideon when she wins the Maine primary.  Both Cook and Sabato rate it a toss up. * In North Carolina, Cal Cunningham (D) is an extremely competitive candidate -- veteran, moderate -- and incumbent Thom Tillis (R) is a first-term Senator.  North Carolina has been trending purple: it has a Dem governor, and it went for Obama.  Cunningham in trailing Tillis just a bit in fundraising, but both Cook and Sabato rate it a toss up. *  In Montana, term-limited Governor Steve Bullock (D) has thrown his hat in the ring, and raised over $3 million almost immediately.  His opponent, Steve Daines, is a first-term Senator.  Both Cook and Sabato rate it Lean Red, but that was from Likely Red before Bullock entered the race.  * In Iowa Joni Ernst is having some problems, and Cook and Sabato changed it from Likely Red to Lean Red. * In Kansas former Republican/now Democrat Barbara Bollier (D) is beating all GOP contenders in terms of fundraising. Although both Cook and Sabato rate it Likely Red, if Tea Party darling Kris Kolbach (R) wins the GOP primary, this could very conceivably go Blue. * Finally, in Kentucky Mitch McConnell seems to be having a real fight on his hands with Amy McGrath (D). She has raised more than him, and was recently polling even with him.  Kentucky has a Democratic Governor, and McConnell only trails Susan Collins in terms of disapproval among constituents.  Although it might be a long shot, McConnell has already been forced to take around $10 million from a Senate PAC to help his campaign in Kentucky.

This probability is subject to a lot of change since it is most directly tied to the democrat's popularity on the generic ballot. Currently, democrats lead republicans on the generic ballot by 7.7 points per 538 (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/). Then we look to structural conditions: the likelihood of a recession (80%), the increased prevalence of Corona which, as the incumbents, Republicans will have to answer for. There are still some unknowns, how the economy will respond to Corona and how Corona will affect voting in November, but currently, most indicators point to democrats retaining the house. Particularly because their wave was due to suburban districts shifting from the Republican party a trend based on Trump and unlikely to be reversed. (85% Democrats hold the house)  2) Then we move to the probability that the Republicans retain the senate. Currently, they have a 3 seat lead which they need to hold onto. Additionally, Senator Doug Jones in Alabama is incredibly vulnerable as his state has a pronounced republican lean. While he has comparable approval ratings in Alabama to the Republican Senator (https://morningconsult.com/senator-rankings/), the fact that the election is in a presidential year will subject his race to turn out for Trump in Alabama. Democrats agree and are not investing in that race as of right now (https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2020/03/24/senate-leadership-fund-announces-initial-fall-advertising-spend-786338). So it is fair to say the Democrats have to win 4 seats. However, there are only 4 seats in the toss-up column: Maine (Susan Collins), Colorado (Corey Gardner), North Caroline (Tills) and Arizona (Martha McSalley). Given statewide election results in 2018 and the newfound democratic tilt of Maine and Colorado, it is easy to imagine these states going into the Democratic column. Arizona is a swing state this year and will likely go the way of the presidential election but democrats are fielding a strong candidate (Mark Kelly) and he is up against Martha McSalley who lost in 2018, but barely. Democrats will need one more pick-up in North Carolina where they won the governorship in 2016 but lost on statewide ballots in 2018 by about 2 points. The electoral layout favors the republicans holding the Senate however democrats are only about 3 points on the generic ballot away from having a 50-50 shot to take the institution and the likely recession might put us over. There is still ambiguity over how Corona will affect voting but that is less of a concern because Maine, Colorado, and North Carolina have democratic governors who I assume will fight for their partisans to vote  (59% the Republicans hold the Senate).

Like 2016, I think it's reasonable to assume the national House vote tracks ahead of Trump's margin in raw votes and percentage, and that will happen in a few states as well, but I could also see that being reversed like in AZ where Democrats pick up a Senate seat with a \"national hero\" type candidate running but Trump stands a fighting chance to carry the state in the GE. Democrats pick up a few seats but that is washed away by other seats going GOP (including a surprise win in Michigan, where James runs 3-5% ahead of Trump at least). Even with a Trump popular vote win, it'll be hard for the GOP to win enough seats to flip the House, although they would be picking some seats up. Democrats keep the House, Republicans keep the Senate. No change. Much of this could change depending on how each is perceived to be responding to the Coronavirus national and worldwide crisis. The early returns seem to be while there is plenty of criticism to go around, especially of the administration, things are moving along in Congress like they have not in years and we have entered a bipartisan crisis mode of a trillion dollar package potentially passing in the next few weeks.

In my predication, I conclude that the republicans are likely to maintain control of the White House (see my predication there for the reasoning). Therefore, Republicans are likely to maintain control of the Senate.  A Biden ticket has the possibility of flipping the senate seat in North Carolina and Arizona I give a 60% for NC and a 40% chance for Arizona, It is also likely that Democrats are going to rally against Susan Collins and Cory Gardner, I give a 75% chance that both those seats will flip. Which gives a 13.5% chance that Democrats would be able to flip all those seats. However, that is only a 50-50 split, which leave the Republicans in control due to my predication over the presidency. Also. I predict that Doug Jones only has a 25% chance of maintaining his seat. However, A Biden-Abrams ticket could flip the special election in Georgia.

Meanwhile, North Carolina and Iowa are potential Democratic flips as well, but I believe they are less likely.

Warren Buffett once said, \"I don't look to jump over 7-foot bars: I look around for 1-foot bars that I can step over\". It is not that Democrats cannot win the Senate -I assume they will maintain control of the House-, but that they have to jump over a 7-foot bar to do so and the Republicans have the easier task of jumping over a 1-foot bar. To take control, Democrats need a net gain of 4 seats or 3 seats plus the vice-president's tie-breaking vote. Added to this difficulty, the Senate electoral map does not favour the Democrats: the seats up for grabs already lean-Republican, so a conservative estimate would assume that the Republicans do enough to keep control. It's not a slam dunk: the Republicans are spread wide, defending 23 of the 35 seats on the ballot, so in terms of who has a chance to flip a seat, the Democrats are more likely. Election forecasters Inside Elections, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball and The Cook Political Report currently rate Democrats\u2019 opportunities to pick up seats more favorably than Republicans\u2019. Again, Republicans have a margin of error.  2016 showed that Senate elections have become about national issues: every state in the Senate race backed the same party for president and Senate for the first time ever.
