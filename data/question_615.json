This would have resulted in a 100% yes answer. However it looks like it is more likely for riots and violence to end in casualties in other countries such as somalia or south sudan, than in zimbabwe which was skewing the data. As such I took historical data from zimbabwe only to get a better statistical number for likelihood of casualty per event.   Looking back at the data from April through august, I used the data to come up with estimated rates. As a first glance, there were casualties in april, and july, so 2/5 months giving an initial rate of 40% yes. However in both of those months, there were multiple fatalities, so it bears looking into a better statistical method to find the likelihood. Across the 5 months, there were 24 cases of violence against civilians, with 2 resulting in fatalities, or 8.3%. similarly there were 45 riots, 2 resulting in fatalities, or 4.4%. Using this data, assuming no significant change in the amount of violence, we can use the average number of events per month to estimate that there will be 9 riots, and 4.8 events of violence against civilians. Treating these as independent events, this results in a final estimate of a 34% probability that violence against civilians will result in a casualty in October, and 33.3% that riots will. combining these, yields a final value of 56% likelihood that there will be a fatality in October.  This appears consistent with a 40% initial estimate that seemed low based on the multiple fatalities in April and July.

In the past two decades, 14 years (70%) have seen 4  (maximum number still possible for this year) or more months in which relevant fatalities were recorded. In the past decade this number was 9 (90%). As four months with relevant fatalities this year would necessarily include October, this suggests that the estimate should be higher than the base rate of approximately 50%.  On the other hand, at least overall, the fourth quarter of the year seems to be the least violent period of the year - in 8 of the 20 full years available (40%), no relevant fatality was recorded in the last quarter of the year, compared to only 4 or 5 fatality-free first, second or third quarters. Within the fourth quarter October does not seem to be particularly affected as relevant fatalities were recorded in October, November and December in roughly the same frequency over the past two decades (in 8, 8 and 7 out of 20 years respectively). However, it should be considered that in the period 2007-2016 the median number of months in which fatalities occurred per year was roughly 6 and their distribution was more even than in the previous decade ( the interquartile range was roughly 3 (2007-2016) compared to 6 (1997-2006)), pointing to more regular occurrence of violence in the country.  While there might be some reason for a seasonal adjustment of the probability of one or more relevant fatality occurring in October, based on the available data, this effect is likely to be rather small.  A quick internet search turned up nothing special for October, which means an estimate above but close to the base rate seems reasonable.   \n\n "], [39781, "2017-09-28T11:05:15Z", [0.95], ""], [40392, "2017-09-28T08:02:59Z", [0.99], ""], [30364, "2017-09-28T04:41:48Z", [0.3], ""], [30364, "2017-09-27T22:08:00Z", [0.3], ""], [40381, "2017-09-27T20:59:14Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-27T20:47:48Z", [0.1], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T20:36:52Z", [0.0], ""], [8336, "2017-09-27T19:32:53Z", [0.15], ""], [40356, "2017-09-27T14:54:16Z", [0.66], ""], [29266, "2017-09-27T13:44:40Z", [0.15], "Fatalities from violence against civilians/remote violence recorded for only one month in 2017 (April) and three months in 2016.
