Forest has come under fire for remarks he's made disparaging the efficacy of mask-wearing that Democrats have exploited. The closeness of the Tar Heel State as the ultimate swing state this election means this one may never be comfortably put away for Cooper. Still, he is running the best of any statewide Democrat on the ballot, and it remains in the Lean Democratic column.\" https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/governors/governors-overview/governors-updates-rating-changes-missouri-and-vermont"], [75863, "2020-09-13T22:56:43Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-09-13T14:47:28Z", [0.88, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [86785, "2020-09-13T00:18:22Z", [0.94, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [58028, "2020-09-12T11:57:42Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-09-11T13:39:54Z", [0.41, 0.59, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2020-09-10T17:23:36Z", [0.86, 0.14, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-09-10T13:58:09Z", [0.96, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-09-10T13:15:18Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-09-09T15:28:08Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [58028, "2020-09-09T08:37:49Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-09-08T23:56:06Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [90433, "2020-09-08T18:01:47Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], "Cooper is popular in a state tuning blue.
