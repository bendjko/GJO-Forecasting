According to BBC, he wrote a letter to his son, the current King Felipe VI, expressing his wish for his son to rule in peace. It is clear that the recent investigations between the former king and Saudi Arabia has bothered him. So, the risk of the investigation (he has lost immunity now that he has abdicated) and the possibility of tarnishing his son's reputation by proximity lowers his chance of returning from 50% to 10%. He also has not publicly expressed a desire to return to Spain, which further lowers the chance to 4%. However, he may wish to visit his family, so the probability will be raised to 5% (minor increase due to the ease of communication via technology in today's society). Carles Puigdemont is a current member of the European Parliament (EUP), and resides in Brussels, Belgium. He led a Catalonian Independence Referendum in 2017, so he still faces charges for sedition. He also may face investigation due to the recent police raids suspecting separatists of supporting Carles Puigdemont's lifestyle in a mansion in Belgium. However, he has expressed a desire to help lead the separatist party of JxCat, so there is a chance of him returning. But since there are only days until the election, he may return to help his party with popularity, or he may stay away to avoid tarnishing the credibility of his party. His personal concerns lowers his chance of returning to 20%, and his desire to help the separatist party has a neutral effect on the chance. With the probability of the two returning by February 14, the chances of Juan Carlos I returning and Carles Puidgemont not would be 4%; chances of Juan Carlos not returning and Carles Puidgemont returning would be 19%; chances of both returning would be 1%; and chances of both not returning would be 0.76"], [98171, "2021-02-10T20:44:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [98259, "2021-02-10T10:18:15Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.97], "Former King Carlos has exiled himself, and does not seem likely to return before February 14.
