China realizes that it cannot continue to prop up the renminbi.  China\u2019s reserves were estimated at 4t in June 2014, and by April 2016 were down to 3.22t(1).  So over the course of those 25 months China spent 780b to prop up the renminbi, which equals 31.2b per month.   At that rate, China only has enough reserves to cover 128 months or 10 years.  Now although 10 years is a long time, it\u2019s not in international finance. By pegging for so long, China was able to achieve \u201cartificial\u201d valuation growth.  This growth turned into confidence, which turned into rosy projections, which turned into debt\u2026  On the contrary, China has built a nice foreign reserve\u2026  Growing up is easy, maturing is not and right now China has some serious maturing to do. In order to simultaneously deal with internal debt issues and curtail the depletion of foreign reserves China will have to allow the renminbi to depreciate (of course China will tightly control such movements).  A slow, controlled devaluation of the renminbi, along with internal structural changes (such as better banking regulations) are really the only chances for stability and long-term prosperity.

I think a devaluation to 7.0000 this year should go some way to capture the internal problems of the debt mountain that the country has well enough ($1.7tn). Furthermore, currency will devalue further in the coming year, I reckon.

I might be a little aggressive by saying 7.0000, so I will probably give slightly above majority to my 6.6-6.8 range answer to indicate my primary thought process here, which I would like to revise as we move ahead. 6.8+ is a daring answer, but one I believe has a higher likelihood than under 6.6 put together - also, given that in my logic, 6.8 could be a very high probability focal point, I would give due consideration to this thought - hence giving half the probability of 6.6-6.8 range.

This idea is embodied in  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)  theory,  which  states  that  the  exchange  rate  is  proportional  to  the ratio  of  price  levels  in  the  two  countries.  To  illustrate,  Figure  1.1  uses  annual  data  to  plot  the  exchange  rate  (relative  to  the  US  dollar)  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  Japan  and  the  ratio  of  their price  level  to  that  of  the  US.    British  prices  increased  relative  to  those  in  the  US  over  the  past  30 years,  while  those  of  Japan  decreased.    According  to  PPP  theory,  the  British  pound  should  have depreciated  (an  increase  in  the  pound  cost  of  the  dollar),  and  the  Japanese  yen  should  have appreciated.    This  is  what  in  fact  happened.    Even though  at  times  the  exchange  rate  deviates substantially  from  the  price  ratio,  there  is  a  distinct  tendency  for  this  ratio  to  play  the  role  of  the underlying trend, or anchor, for the exchange rate.   That is to say, while the exchange rate meanders around  the  price  ratio,  over  time  it  has  a  tendency to  revert  to  this  trend  value,  so  the  ratio  can  be thought  of  as  the  \u201cunderlying  value\u201d  of  the  currency.    Figure  1.1  thus  provides  some prima  facie evidence in favour of PPP over the long term\" Another argument based on prior history of exchange rates, Exchange rates went from 8.19 in 2005 to 6.2 in 2015. A 32% appreciation. Unless the CCP has gone crazy, a 45.6% appreciation is not possible. 20% seems much more likely. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29\nhttp://www.web.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1082586/10-14_The_Big_Mac_Indes_Two_Decades_On-An_Evaluation_of_Burgernomics.pdf\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/PUBLICAT/ECONREV/econrevarchive/1992/3Q92hakk.pdf\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_renminbi_exchange_rates#cite_note-exchange_rate-7"], [102, "2016-04-21T03:53:37Z", [0.09, 0.44, 0.3, 0.17], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/21/gitrep-20apr16pm/"], [691, "2016-04-20T21:38:55Z", [0.13, 0.63, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-04-20T21:37:27Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1993, "2016-04-20T21:32:59Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.4, 0.2], ""], [110, "2016-04-20T20:28:12Z", [0.05, 0.65, 0.25, 0.05], "Moderating, based on current trend"], [20135, "2016-04-20T15:11:01Z", [0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [15621, "2016-04-20T08:39:01Z", [0.0, 0.72, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [21046, "2016-04-19T23:50:28Z", [0.35, 0.45, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [691, "2016-04-19T22:40:46Z", [0.13, 0.62, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-04-19T19:19:53Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [12518, "2016-04-19T17:52:52Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.47, 0.02], ""], [12518, "2016-04-19T17:52:30Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.52, 0.03], ""], [12518, "2016-04-19T17:51:58Z", [0.0, 0.51, 0.46, 0.03], ""], [23181, "2016-04-19T15:09:32Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [23234, "2016-04-19T10:01:05Z", [0.09, 0.43, 0.43, 0.05], ""], [94, "2016-04-19T04:01:30Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [368, "2016-04-18T22:03:18Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [4992, "2016-04-18T20:45:58Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [691, "2016-04-18T18:23:17Z", [0.11, 0.61, 0.28, 0.0], ""], [24027, "2016-04-18T15:43:31Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [22814, "2016-04-18T12:22:34Z", [0.05, 0.45, 0.45, 0.05], ""], [22113, "2016-04-18T08:36:06Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [12937, "2016-04-18T04:01:36Z", [0.3, 0.65, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [877, "2016-04-18T00:44:03Z", [0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [627, "2016-04-17T22:04:21Z", [0.3, 0.35, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [20209, "2016-04-17T21:03:41Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-04-17T19:22:51Z", [0.12, 0.59, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2016-04-17T18:25:41Z", [0.1, 0.3, 0.55, 0.05], ""], [10759, "2016-04-17T16:22:47Z", [0.18, 0.54, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [4634, "2016-04-17T16:22:34Z", [0.18, 0.54, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [23997, "2016-04-17T15:41:27Z", [0.09, 0.66, 0.22, 0.03], ""], [12874, "2016-04-17T11:53:58Z", [0.06, 0.52, 0.37, 0.05], ""], [23409, "2016-04-16T20:32:16Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.25], ""], [691, "2016-04-16T17:02:01Z", [0.12, 0.57, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [11053, "2016-04-16T15:31:47Z", [0.1, 0.56, 0.25, 0.09], ""], [10916, "2016-04-16T11:13:55Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.32, 0.03], ""], [16253, "2016-04-16T05:28:17Z", [0.45, 0.48, 0.05, 0.02], ""], [23956, "2016-04-16T03:26:50Z", [0.07, 0.39, 0.47, 0.07], ""], [691, "2016-04-15T19:56:45Z", [0.12, 0.57, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-04-15T19:44:10Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [21012, "2016-04-15T16:26:34Z", [0.5, 0.4, 0.09, 0.01], "RMB is currently at 6.47/USD (Apr 15th).

Volatility has picked up quite a bit since January 2014, however we can see that the currency is still tightly controlled. After a relatively rapid appreciation of 0.47% per month against the US Dollar, the CNY appreciated at a much slower pace from May 2010 to January 2014, at about 0.27% per month. What's most interesting to me is that since the CNY began depreciating in January of 2014, the pace of depreciation has been almost exactly the same 0.27% per month. It is quite likely that the Chinese government is comfortable with this pace of depreciation and are very likely to stick to it despite what market commentators or other countries might say (as evidenced in their management of the CNY appreciation from 2005 to 2013). Extrapolating out 6.633 months at that same rate gives us an expected value of 6.61 for the CNY at 30 September. The thing that might change the pace of this rate is a more pronounced weakening in the local economy. Over the past couple of years the CNY has actually appreciated significantly against many of its trading partners as emerging market and developed Asia currencies as well as the EUR have sold off against the Dollar between 15 and 35%. Volatility in global markets may also hasten the depreciation if the Dollar continues to strengthen. My expected value for the CNY is right at the 6.6 break point, however, it appears that the forces favoring a more rapid depreciation are prevailing. A depreciation past 6.8 seems unlikely, as that would mean an almost 5% move.
