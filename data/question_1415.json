Since the future of international order isn't any longer determined by a bipolar (USSR vs USA) nuclear balance, the balances generated by rivalries between smaller nuclear powers should be added to the equation that makes up the new global balance.    Thus, the main factor that affects NPT consensus is the dynamics of this multipolar nuclear balance. >Risks trigger Pakistani and Indian oppositions to NPT consensus:\n-Overall situation in Jammu-Kashmir, \n-India's recent immigration policy, \n-Indian atrocities against Muslims, \n-Pakistan's support for activities by terrorist org. like TTP in Kashmir. >Leverages (some of which are happened-to-be-leverages) against potential Chinese and Russian oppositions to NPT consensus:\n-Economic downturn related with the spread of Covid-19\n-Trade wars.\n-Economic Sanctions \n-Sustainable oil production strategy by US & OPEC (questionable)  >Reasons for Chinese opposition to NPT consensus: \n-Increase in China's needs to deter SCS rivals who are mostly backed by a nuclear superpower (US)   Some facts: \n*According to Indian strategists Pakistan's nuclear proliferation is aided by China's PLA.\n*According to US intelligence Pakistan helped North Korea for its nuclear program ( supplying gas centrifuges) to get missile tech in return.\n(China couldn't help Pakistan because it was under US pressure for no doing so)   \n*China is also known for its aide in North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n*Pakistan helped Libya for its nuclear weapons program by sending centrifuges (Pak-1) to Libya (Late 1990s)\n*North Korea withdrew from NPT in 2003.   Conclusion: \n*Russia and US may not want to disturb this recent nuclear balance because it would add more complexity to their calculations. So regardless, they may push for a consensus likely via their influence over smaller nuclear powers. However, overlapping nuclear balances, like US-Russia, Pakistan-India, China-India, and Japan(threshold)-North Korea, may lead to separate proliferation alliances resembling alliances in WWI. So, the more the sovereignty-based geopolitical measures play role in strengthening rivalries between nuclear powers, the less the chance NPT produces a consensus statement this spring (2020).

While smaller nations are unlikely to be a major stumbling block to a consensus agreement, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) revealed that some small delegations \u201cfelt excluded\u201d from the negotiating process in 2015\n(https://cpr.unu.edu/why-the-2015-npt-review-conference-fell-apart.html).  Other larger countries also had misgivings and reservations about even the draft in 2015.  Despite the significance of the 50 year anniversary, many of the same dynamics will probably play out.   Countries with complications\nTurkey - Turkey's nationalistic leader Recep Erdogan has made a number of provocative statements regarding nuclear weapons since rising to power, including comments in November when he noted, \"the world is bigger than five.\" (https://thebulletin.org/2019/11/taking-erdogans-critique-of-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-seriously/). Other comments like \u201cSome countries have missiles with nuclear warheads [but say] we can\u2019t have them... This I cannot accept\u201d  are similarly disturbing and would be a serious obstacle to a consensus statement. \nIran - One of the key sticking points in the 2015 RevCon was progress toward a WMD Free Middle East.  Recent tension and kinetic strikes back and forth with the U.S., and the functional death of the JCPOA have almost certainly impacted Iran's willingness to cooperate on issues regarding potential development of nuclear weapons.   Criticality of issues - \nBoth Turkey and Iran have pointed to the apparent disconnect between countries 'allowed' to possess nuclear weapons and those not allowed to acquire them.  The non- NPT countries of India, Pakistan, and Israel all acquired nuclear weapons as part of their security strategy.  Iran has long argued the right to develop nuclear weapons in response to Israel's undeclared nuclear capability.  Over the past 10-15 years Turkey has sought respect and acknowledgement from parties in both Europe and the Middle East.  Seeking nuclear weapons (or at least talking about it) has been at least one line of effort they pursued to accomplish this end.  The continued pursuit of nuclear capability serves a key role in both countries strategy.   A weak consensus agreement is possible to achieve a \"result\" on the 50th anniversary of the treaty.  Despite areas of divergence, larger countries like Russia, China, and the U.S. almost certainly influence the drafting of any proposed final statement and could set conditions for a symbolic win, though the impact of a statement would be limited.  Additionally, while disarmament among the N5 is also an issue, it probably does not represent a key strategy pillar for those those countries pressing for it.  \n"], [14107, "2020-01-14T16:54:56Z", [0.28], ""], [13306, "2020-01-14T01:54:42Z", [0.03], ""], [81512, "2020-01-13T21:11:34Z", [0.2], "Comment deleted on Jan 21, 2020 08:06PM UTC"], [81519, "2020-01-13T20:49:33Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2020-01-13T19:34:32Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-01-13T13:20:29Z", [0.32], ""], [81500, "2020-01-12T19:51:23Z", [0.1], ""], [29054, "2020-01-12T19:40:58Z", [0.0], ""], [31275, "2020-01-12T15:27:08Z", [0.25], ""], [1034, "2020-01-11T22:09:09Z", [0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-01-11T21:54:36Z", [0.04], ""], [1333, "2020-01-11T14:25:17Z", [0.33], ""], [1034, "2020-01-10T22:43:47Z", [0.0], ""], [529, "2020-01-10T17:02:46Z", [0.12], ""], [19127, "2020-01-10T15:57:24Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2020-01-10T15:09:32Z", [0.01], ""], [75863, "2020-01-10T01:27:58Z", [0.01], ""], [31251, "2020-01-10T00:20:35Z", [0.02], ""], [37236, "2020-01-09T20:15:45Z", [0.07], ""], [32100, "2020-01-09T14:26:54Z", [0.01], ""], [81450, "2020-01-09T09:05:01Z", [0.0], ""], [43311, "2020-01-08T23:59:20Z", [0.0], "Your registration in SSGS300 Research Design and Methods at AMU is confirmed.

SO - this time the Russians are going to give it a whirl with the largest Nuke Ex in years - \nGROM 2019\nRussia\u2019s recent nuclear forces exercise was probably its largest since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Uncertainty remains over the exact number and type of weapons tested. The exercise suggests that nuclear systems remain fundamental to Moscow\u2019s approach to deterrence, and can be understood, at least in part, as an attempt to convey to Washington the benefits of extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.\nIn October 2019, Russia carried out what was probably its largest nuclear forces exercise since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. All legs of Russia\u2019s nuclear triad of land-, air- and sea-based nuclear weapons were tested, and the involvement of dual-capable theater-range systems was noteworthy. While the Russian defense ministry runs an annual command post exercise of its nuclear capability, Grom (Thunder)-2019 was notable both for its scale and for its comparative level of \u2018openness\u2019, providing messages intended for both a domestic audience and international rivals. That said, uncertainty remained over the exact number and type of weapons tested.\nThe exercise was held within an international context of eroding arms control and increased friction between Russia on the one hand and the United States and its NATO allies on the other. The only remaining nuclear-weapons treaty, New START, expires in February 2021, but could be extended by up to five years if Russia and the US agree. While Moscow has expressed interest in an extension, the administration of US President Donald Trump is due to make a decision on the treaty in 2020.\nIn symbolic terms, Grom-2019 was in some ways reminiscent of Soviet-era May Day Parades through Red Square, in which ballistic missile followed ballistic missile, projecting Moscow\u2019s military strength to international rivals. While the primary mission of Grom-2019 was to demonstrate the effectiveness of nuclear systems, its scale can be understood, at least in part, as an attempt to convey to Washington both the benefits of extending New START, as well as Moscow\u2019s warning that it remains committed to its nuclear arsenal\u2019s role as a deterrent, and ultimately its use during wartime if deterrence fails.\nGrom-2019 was held between 15 and 17 October and had two main stages. The 48 hours of 15\u201316 October were used to model an escalatory confrontation with an unidentified rival state, or perhaps a hostile coalition, leading up to a nuclear confrontation. The second phase on 17 October culminated in a series of missile launches approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his role as commander-in-chief, supported by Minister of Defense General Sergei Shoigu.\nThe exercise scenario postulated a conflict on Russia\u2019s borders that was categorized as a threat to Moscow\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The adversary\u2019s supposed escalation and resulting use of nuclear weapons required a nuclear response from Russia\u2019s strategic and possibly theater-level forces.\nRussia\u2019s strategic systems have been better insulated from the low levels of investment that eroded the country\u2019s conventional capabilities during the 1990s and well into the first decade of this century. Despite this, however, Moscow has been forced to sustain a range of nuclear delivery systems beyond their planned out-of-service dates, as successor weapons were either delayed or introduced into service at lower rates than originally expected. As well as testing more recent systems, Grom-2019 appears to have been used to stress-test a number of ageing weapons in order to determine their reliability.\n Grom-2019 was scheduled to feature the launch of a total of 16 ballistic and cruise missiles. By comparison, previous exercises in recent times have featured smaller numbers of live firings. On 14 October, the day before the exercise began, the Russian defense ministry briefed Russian media that there would be multiple launches of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) within a 24-hour period.\nUnits deployed \nGrom-2019 involved 12,000 personnel, 20 warships, five submarines and 105 combat aircraft, including heavy bombers from the Aerospace Forces\u2019 Long-Range Aviation Command, as well as numerous units from the Strategic Rocket Forces and the army. The nuclear command-and-control hierarchy, from President Putin downwards, was also involved as a key element of the exercise.\n\u2018Grom-2019 involved 12,000 personnel, 20 warships, five submarines and 105 combat aircraft.\u2019 Alongside the land-based Strategic Rocket Forces, two nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs) \u2013 one from the Northern Fleet and one from the Pacific Fleet \u2013 and Tu-95MS Bear H bomber aircraft from units at Engels and Ukrainka air bases participated in the exercise. Dual-capable platforms involved in the exercise included the Severodvinsk, a Project 885 Yasen-class nuclear-powered attack submarine, and the Admiral Gorshkov, a Project 22350 Gorshkov-class frigate, both of which are in service with the Northern Fleet. Two Gepard-class frigates, the Dagestan and the Tatarstan, of the Caspian Flotilla, also took part in the exercise, as did the Grad Sviyazhsk, a Project 21631 Buyan-M-class corvette, also from the Caspian Flotilla. With the exception of the older Tatarstan, all of the aforementioned designs have been fitted to carry the Novator 3M14 Kalibr (SS-N-30A) land-attack cruise missile. Conventionally armed variants of the 3M14 have been launched by surface ships and submarines during Russia\u2019s intervention in the Syrian civil war. The 3M14 is a successor to the Soviet-era 3M10 Granat (SS-N-21 Sampson) nuclear-armed cruise missile, introduced into service in 1984. In 1991, Washington and Moscow declared they would stop deploying nuclear-armed cruise missiles at sea, although it remained unclear whether Russia had in fact implemented this pledge with the SS-N-21. This missile is now assumed to no longer be in service. The Strategic Rocket Forces launched an RS-24 Yars (SS-27 mod 2) ICBM from the Plesetsk test range in northern Russia on 17 October, with the missile impacting the Kura range on the Kola Peninsula. The Karelia, a Delfin Project 667BDRM (Delta IV) boat and part of the Northern Fleet, fired an R-29RMU2 Sineva (SS-N-23 Skiff) SLBM from the Barents Sea. The Ryazan, a Kalmar Project 667BDR (Delta III) boat and part of the Pacific Fleet, launched an R-29RKU-02 Stantsia-2 (SS-N-18 Stingray) from the Sea of Okhotsk. The Ryazan was reportedly intended to salvo-fire two missiles, but a technical issue with the missile identified prior to launch meant only a single firing was carried out.\nThe naval ballistic-missile firings were probably intended to confirm their reliability. The first SS-N-18 was introduced into service in 1978, while the SS-N-23 followed in 1986. A further improvement of the latter, known as R-29RMU2.1 Layner, entered the inventory around 2007. The combination of the Delta III boat and SS-N-18 SLBM is likely to be withdrawn from service no later than the early 2020s. While the navy\u2019s latest SSBN \u2013 the Borey class \u2013 was not used to fire a missile during this exercise, one firing was carried out at the end of October. This was reportedly the first launch of the Bulava (SS-N-32) SLBM from the Prince Vladimir, which has yet to formally join the fleet, but is the first of the improved Borey-A design. It is likely, although unconfirmed, that the Russian Navy is increasingly using its three Borey SSBNs on deterrent patrols in comparison to the older Delta III and Delta IV boats. There are also suggestions that, for the moment at least, the Russian defense ministry is reluctant to use the Chizha range as the target of Bulava firings, over concerns that the direction in which missiles are being fired and their final location enables the Western intelligence community to examine their flight parameters more easily. The air-launched nuclear component of the exercise involved the Tu-95MS Bear H launching the Kh-102 (AS-23B Kodiak) long-range land-attack cruise missile. The Bear H can carry up to eight of the Kh-102 on four twin racks under the wing, as the missile is too long to fit inside the Bear\u2019s internal weapons bay. The cruise missiles were used to attack targets on the Pemboi test range in northern Russia. Two 9K720 Iskander-M-equipped missile brigades, one from the Southern and one from the Eastern military district, carried out firings, although the type of missile was not identified. The 9K720 can include the 9M723 (SS-26 Stone) short-range ballistic missile and the 9M728 (SSC-7 Southpaw) short-range cruise missile. The far longer range 9M729 (SSC-8 Screwdriver) cruise missile is carried in a similar transporter-erector-launcher vehicle to the 9M728. The deployment of Screwdriver brought about the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, but Moscow disputes NATO\u2019s allegations concerning its range, and the Russian defence ministry briefings about the exercise contained no reference to it.\nUnlike other nuclear exercises in recent years, the Russian Ministry of Defense briefed Russian media about Grom-2019 and released selected official information about the exercise. The intention, at least in part, may have been to demonstrate to a domestic audience that Russia remains a \u2018strategic\u2019 power capable of meeting any threat posed by an external aggressor, and that Putin continues to lead a strong, militarily capable country that demands respect and its rightful place on the world stage. The scale of the exercise was probably intended to convey to international observers that, even though some of its systems are ageing, the Russian armed forces retains a formidable nuclear capability that is operationally fit for purpose. \u2018The intention, at least in part, may have been to demonstrate to a domestic audience that\u2026Putin continues to lead a strong, militarily capable country that demands respect and its rightful place on the world stage.\u2019 The capabilities on display during Grom-2019 look likely to be supplemented by a number of \u2018new\u2019 strategic systems in service or soon to be in service \u2013 but in development for at least a decade \u2013 that are intended to allow Russia to penetrate enemy missile defences. Moscow is close to introducing the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle into service. The Avangard will initially be deployed using a variant of the UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto mod-X-4) ICBM, until its longer-term launch vehicle, the RS-28 Sarmat (SS-X-29) ICBM, enters service. Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on 13 November that the first units of the SS-19 fitted with Avangard would be deployed with the Dombarovsky missile division by the end of 2019. The defense ministry did not confirm any involvement of the Avangard in its statements about Grom-2019. On 26 November, TASS claimed that a US inspection team had been \u2018shown\u2019 Avangard as part of the New START Treaty inspection regime. While there has been little doubt that Avangard would be included under the treaty regime, there is less clarity regarding some of Moscow\u2019s other developmental systems \u2013 in particular, the Burevestnik (SSC-X-9 Skyfall) nuclear-powered ground-launched cruise missile and the Status-6 (Kanyon) nuclear-powered nuclear-armed underwater munition. If they can be made to work as advertised, both of these systems offer very long endurance. The subsonic Burevestnik cruise missile, for instance, could remain airborne for days. This extended endurance would arguably provide far greater suitability, with the missile able to be flown on circuitous routes to the target, or placed in a holding flight pattern to improve survivability as a second-strike weapon. The same rationale would appear to apply to the Status-6.\nSignificant uncertainty remains about exactly which systems were tested during Grom-2019, as well as the precise role of nuclear weapons in Russian strategy. While it would therefore be unwise to draw confident inferences from the exercise, Grom-2019 does clearly demonstrate that, although Moscow has directed significant funding to conventional weapons systems over the past decade, nuclear systems remain fundamental to Russia\u2019s approach to deterrence. The involvement of comparatively short-range dual-capable weapons, such as the 3M14 and Iskander-M systems, also raises the question of their role in Russian thinking on nuclear escalation and containment. The US and NATO\u2019s conviction that Russia\u2019s 9M729 ground-launched cruise missile was a material breach of the INF caused the collapse of the treaty. In an uncomfortable echo of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Washington and Moscow confronted each other in Europe with theater nuclear weapons, the involvement of these weapons in Russian exercises raises the alarming specter of Europe once again being considered a potential theater for a limited nuclear exchange.\n\u2018Significant uncertainty remains about exactly which systems were tested during Grom-2019, as well as the precise role of nuclear weapons in Russian strategy.\u2019"], [1333, "2019-12-12T16:26:55Z", [0.51], ""], [71701, "2019-12-12T14:39:18Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-12-12T13:01:28Z", [0.01], ""], [74579, "2019-12-12T07:28:40Z", [0.5], ""], [73687, "2019-12-12T04:54:39Z", [0.04], ""], [27661, "2019-12-11T19:31:36Z", [0.07], ""], [1333, "2019-12-11T19:22:23Z", [0.52], ""], [75863, "2019-12-11T13:54:58Z", [0.15], ""], [54584, "2019-12-11T13:48:18Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-12-11T13:30:15Z", [0.01], ""], [14107, "2019-12-10T21:07:42Z", [0.35], ""], [1034, "2019-12-10T19:43:56Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-10T18:48:24Z", [0.53], ""], [32861, "2019-12-09T20:45:07Z", [0.35], "A chance they will say something minimal due to a range of elections.

Non nuclear weapon states will most likely point to the failure to curb Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions, in addition to the US and Russia continuing to modernize their own stockpiles, while they are still prohibited for owning nuclear weapons.
