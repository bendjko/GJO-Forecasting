Marshall, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that \u201cWe cannot compromise the integrity of the system of separated powers and the role of the Judiciary in that system, even with respect to challenges that may seem innocuous at first blush.\u201d While it may not appear to be a direct assault on the principle of civilian control of the military to have active-duty military officers serve as CMCR judges, it is an assault nevertheless, because it potentially opens the door to far more expansive service by active-duty military officers in positions (like Article I judgeships) historically reserved to civilians. The Supreme Court has never had a case about the dual-officeholding statute in the 147 years it\u2019s been on the books. But now may well be an especially propitious time for the Court to reaffirm the role that statutes like \u00a7 973(b)(2) play in our constitutional system\u2014and to reassert the preference for civilian control of the government that such statutes enshrine.\""], [23006, "2018-02-05T03:24:41Z", [0.49], ""], [44979, "2018-02-04T21:52:52Z", [0.5], ""], [47806, "2018-02-04T02:26:07Z", [0.99], "This is an obvious cut-and-dry ruling."], [691, "2018-02-03T19:08:28Z", [0.76], ""], [50747, "2018-02-03T16:53:01Z", [0.25], "seems logical"], [746, "2018-02-03T16:40:04Z", [0.45], ""], [1333, "2018-02-03T15:51:01Z", [0.75], ""], [1333, "2018-02-03T15:47:03Z", [0.75], ""], [11430, "2018-02-03T15:29:42Z", [0.6], ""], [49782, "2018-02-03T15:28:47Z", [0.75], "The court is likely to determine that the judge is not a civil servant within meaning of the statute.

It is obvious that they are taking the jurisdiction question quite seriously since they had the amicus professor join the oral argument. And if they have jurisdiction now, they would seem to have analogous jurisdiction over the SEC, and I guess it is established that they don't. But I was left with the feeling that the military tribunal system would be too much insulated from review if the Court were to agree with the professor. If the Court reaches the merits of the case, I think it about a 75 % chance that they rule against the plaintiffs. In order to decide in favour of the plaintiff, they would firstly have to consider Mitchell a dual officeholder and then to decide that he was by virtue of the law automatically booted from his military commission. The two offices that judge Mitchell has are so similar that it makes me ask: if one is a military office, why would the other not be a military office as well. But even if they viewed the CMCR office as a civil one, the question will still resolve as \"No\" if they indeed rule that Mitchell didn't lose his military commission automatically: 'Fletcher told the justices that the service members\u2019 convictions would still stand because another part of the dual-officeholding law, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d indicates that the ban would not invalidate actions taken by \u201can officer in furtherance of assigned official duties.\u201d' (http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/01/argument-analysis-justices-debate-dual-officeholding-ban-jurisdiction-military-courts/) So the probability for petitioners losing is 0,25 + 0,75 * 0,75 = 0,81, so 19 % on the question as stated.

The CMCR is composed of both military and civilian judges and has appellate jurisdiction over all appeals from United States Military courts with regard to military commission cases. Generally, active-duty military officers are barred from simultaneously holding a civilian post without express approval by Congress. The issue in this case is whether service on the CMCR, a civilian post, means that a CMCR judge cannot simultaneously serve as a member of the military on a military court.\nThe CAAF noted that the CCA's ruling upholding Dalmazzi's conviction was issued \"ten days after Colonel Mitchell took the oath of office as a USCMCR appellate judge but two weeks before the President signed his commission.\" Without a signed commission, the court said, \"the President is free to change his mind and not make the appointment; afterwards, he is not.\"[2] The court wrote: \u201c\tAppellant argues that actions Colonel Mitchell took as a judge on the USCMCR before the President issued the commission were public acts that evidenced his appointment. We disagree. It is the President who must perform some public act that evinces the appointment, not the purported appointee. Other than the commission, issued on May 25, 2016, there is no evidence that the President appointed Colonel Mitchell to the USCMCR. Therefore, that is the date of his presidential appointment as judge to the USCMCR. As Colonel Mitchell had not yet been appointed a judge of the USCMCR at the time the judgment in Appellant\u2019s case was released, the case is moot as to these issues.[1][3]\t\u201d\nRelying on the holding in Dalmazzi, the court denied petitioners' claims.[1]"], [10000, "2018-01-17T17:03:41Z", [0.95], ""], [31450, "2018-01-17T15:11:39Z", [0.8], "It seems to be that the judge was serving inappropriately on both a military and civilian panel, something that has been banned by federal law since shortly after the civil war (see link).  https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-961"], [1333, "2018-01-17T14:49:30Z", [0.65], "In the Dalmazzi case the ruling was based on the fact that the judge was commissioned and serving both as a civilian and a JAG officer, however his commission was not signed by the President until a week after the ruing in the Dalmazzi case.
