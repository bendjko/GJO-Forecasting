Although I generally did not (and do not) subscribe to the somewhat technical arguments about the probability of a yield curve inversion based on historical data related to slopes of the line or velocity of change or whatever, I think @Vichisky\u2019s comment on 25 November about the 18 bp contraction following the Lehman news is worth considering. We only have three full trading days left in the year, and those days are over the Christmas holidays.  The markets have felt and absorbed most known major shocks: Fed meeting, government shutdown, etc.  Now the spread is at 0.16, and it\u2019s difficult (but not impossible) to imagine something on par with the Lehman news over the few full trading days that are left. What is one such shock that is not impossible to imagine? Well, there is this issue of Trump firing Jerome Powell that just popped up.  My understanding of the situation is that Trump cannot remove him from the Fed, but that he can replace him as Chair.  All things considered, I think it is very possible Trump might do something along those lines in the very near term.  (Apparently all it will take is a Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter prompt.)  And I think that if that happens, the markets will absolutely freak out.   Would it affect the 2/10 to the point of an inversion?    Hard to say.  In watching how the bond market has reacted to other recent events, I haven\u2019t seen any particular or noteworthy movements with respect to the two-year and 10-year notes.  When bond investors have gone long, all the long instruments seem to have gotten equal attention.   But a Fed Chair has never been replaced like this, and so I\u2019ll keep my hedge for just a bit longer.\n"], [691, "2018-12-23T12:13:17Z", [0.01], ""], [63225, "2018-12-23T07:08:06Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2018-12-22T19:25:00Z", [0.0], ""], [63674, "2018-12-22T18:20:07Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-12-22T13:15:12Z", [0.03], ""], [63409, "2018-12-22T00:44:12Z", [0.01], "Spread is still at 0.16%, and there are only a few days left"], [56, "2018-12-21T23:20:50Z", [0.0], ""], [62424, "2018-12-21T22:40:46Z", [0.05], "On 12/6/18 the spread between the 2 and 10 year is only 13 bps, which half of what it was on my last forecast. The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 74% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). \nSince this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I\u2019ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6.5 basis point (25 bps increase x 26% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 6.5 bps. At this point, I\u2019ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. \nTheoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a term premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the term premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. \nCurrent economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don\u2019t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I\u2019ll remain at 0% probability \nAnother thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I\u2019m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. \nOn the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question. **Since my last forecast the equity market has continued to decline. In addition, the FedWatch probability of an increase has risen and then declined back to its current 74%. This leads me to believe that investor's inflation expectations have decreased and that's why both the 2 and 10 year rates have declined (10 yr moreso). The decrease in the Fedwatch and the equity markets might tell us that low inflationary fears have been incorporated into the 10 yr yield and if the Fed do not raise rates, the 2yr rate should decrease because the market had the probabilities wrong. Subsequently, the 10 yr rate would likely decrease because if increased fears of low inflation and likely invert. On the other hand if the Fed increases rates by 25 bps, the 2yr should increase by 18 bps (25 bps x 74% likelihood) which would also invert the curve at the current 13 bp spread. Though, increased inflation expectations would likely increase the 10 year enough to compensate and the curve would not invert. At this point, the spread is so small, that inversion is likely dependent on the Fed's decision. So, I'll stick with the FedWatch number and say 24% chance of inversion. I\u2019ll add a somewhat arbitrary 10% points to my probability to account for the possibility of negative economic news or random exogenous event. For instance, heightened trade war threats or other negative geopolitical event. I\u2019ll go with 34% for now.\n**After the Fed raised rates on the 19th, the 2/10 spread reacted didn't change much and neither rate changed much either. Now that the major event has passed, there is no more Fed Watch for the year, and there is very limited time until the question closes I'm returning going back to a small 5% uncertainty for my answer to account for something crazy. It doesn't seem out of the question for an inversion, but it is unlikely with four trading sessions left. It seems like fear has gripped the equity market, which could push the inversion if similar expectations creep into the 10 year yield, but trading is usually pretty light this time of year.

So things might yet get a little screwy.   I was surprised to see the reaction to the Fed's decision, given that a December rate hike and a lowering of the dots for 2019 seemed to be what so many people were expecting (and were actually hoping for).  What's totally nuts to me is that not too very long ago at all Jim Cramer, on CNBC, said that if the Fed did not go through with a December rate hike, the markets would panic.  Now he seems to be criticizing that very same rate hike.  Go figure. From what I can tell, one of the things that spooked the markets was Powell's comments about the continued unwinding of the balance sheet.  (I\u2019ve seen plots of the market actually starting its Wednesday tank as the words came out of Powell\u2019s mouth.)  One commentator put it, \"The stock market finally realized what QT means.\"   $50 billion off the Fed balance sheet per month is certainly going to have an impact on bond yields, and thus the stock market.  That is to say, if QE was generally good for the stock market, QT is necessarily going to be bad.  Odd that there was next to no chatter about that in the days and weeks leading up to this week\u2019s meeting. And then there is Donald Trump.

Although that might seem to indicate an over-heated economy, the inflation indicators were well within reason (that is to say, we are very near the Fed\u2019s target of 2% inflation). Given that the economy seems to be strong, and inflation low, I think the Fed can convincingly make a case that interest rates are neutral and ease its foot off the brake.  That seems to be what the talking heads are expecting from this week\u2019s meeting: keep the planned December hike, but pull back on formerly projected 2019 hikes. Furthermore, the stock market just had several hellish days, but bond yields pretty much fell consistently across the entire spectrum of instruments, from short-term to very long-term.  This would seem to indicate that the 2-year and 10-year notes are not getting any particular attention from that. There are a number of other things lurking around, from the trade war with China to a slowdown in Chinese economic activity to Brexit to the U.S. government shutdown.  But from what I can tell the two-year and 10-year are not getting any special attention from these things, either. So unless the Fed does something totally unexpected tomorrow that sends the bond market into a complete tizzy, I am of the opinion that the potential yield curve inversion drama will have basically run its course and it's time to start seriously ratcheting down the probabilities.\n"], [13817, "2018-12-18T12:27:49Z", [0.08], ""], [19801, "2018-12-18T05:19:15Z", [0.15], "The gap is wide right now, so I have reduced my confidence level accordingly.

In my last post I opined that the Fed meeting next week was the thing everyone was waiting for.  That\u2019s true enough.  But I forgot about the 800 pound gorilla that\u2019s roaming around: Donald Trump.  More on him in a minute. Yesterday the spread closed at 0.11, which was down from 0.13 the day before.  The narrowing was largely a result of the two-year yield going up more than the 10-year yield.  Conventional wisdom would have it that more people were fleeing the two-year note than the 10-year note. And that\u2019s probably true, but what\u2019s more interesting (to me) is to look across the entire spectrum of USG bills, notes, and bonds.  The only place yields went down yesterday were in one-month and two-month bills.  The three-month stayed steady, but after that all yields went up until the 30-year, when they held steady again. To me this says that investors were putting their money into very short-term instruments.  I am a bit of a novice in the bond area, but is it too much a stretch to think that they believe the next two months or so might be particularly volatile, but things could be better after that? Honestly, I don\u2019t know.  But it seems reasonable to think that might be the case. What is also interesting is to look at bit deeper at the intra-day trading patterns of the two-year.  The spike in yields began at about noon.  It dropped a bit around 1:30 pm EST, then shot up at about 2:15 pm.   What happened yesterday at noon?  Well, noon was right about the time Donald Trump had a bit of a televised meltdown in which he threatened to shut down the government if he doesn\u2019t get money for his wall. Did that spook bond investors? Again, I don\u2019t know.  But it seems reasonable to think that might be the case. So this is something that I hadn\u2019t really considered before, but that I think needs to be factored in: Donald Trump.  Even if you made the gigantic leap and assumed that all the other factors related to an interest rate inversion were based on logic, we have this one somewhat irrational factor that can probably have as much impact on investor decisions as anything else. It\u2019s worth noting that Trump is under a lot of pressure right now: \t\u2022\tMueller investigation.  From what I can tell, the recent Michael Cohen revelations are a big deal, and more people are talking about impeachment or even jail time.\n\t\u2022\tChief of staff.  After essentially firing John Kelly under the assumption that Nick Ayers would take the job, that turned out not to be the case.  Now the WH appears to be in a flail state looking for a replacement.\n\t\u2022\tChina.  \u2018Nuff said.\n\t\u2022\tThe Wall.  This was his big, big promise.  He couldn\u2019t get it done with a Republican House and Senate, now there are even more challenges with a Democratic House.   And this is where the government shutdown comes in. \tSo if I\u2019m not mistaken, current government funding goes until next Friday, 21 December.  Which means there are two big events next week: The FOMC meeting, and the decision (or not) to shut down the government. Because of Trump\u2019s inherent instability (exacerbated by current pressures) and the Fed\u2019s situational instability discussed earlier \u2014 along with the current spread of only 0.11 \u2014 I think there\u2019s a pretty decent chance of an inversion before year\u2019s end.  On the other hand, if we don\u2019t see it by the end of next week I could imagine the probability dropping dramatically. And by the way, I think it\u2019s also worth noting that \u2014 according to Reuters \u2014 hedge funds \u201cincreased their net short position in two-year Treasuries by the second largest amount this year, and upped their short position in 10-year bonds by only a fraction.\u201d  This is effectively a bet that the gap will narrow."], [41389, "2018-12-12T09:28:10Z", [0.03], "it contracted 20 bps over last week or so, so it could get there."], [63539, "2018-12-11T23:45:55Z", [0.45], "The 2-10 is close to inverting, and it would probably just take the Fed raising rates in combination with poor economics news to make it invert.

And the conventional wisdom is that it portends a recession.  And right now, for instance, the Internet is awash in opinion pieces about whether last week\u2019s belly-of-the-curve inversion points to a recession. But very little has been written about what factors go into creating an inversion.  Why does the yield curve invert?  What is inducing investors to leave equities and short-term fixed income instruments and go into longer-term fixed-income instruments? Up until this weekend the most credible opinions I could find indicated that a yield curve inversion is preceded by the Fed loosening interest rate hikes.  The logic is that if the Fed is loosening interest rate hikes, it must perceive that the economy is slowing down and it\u2019s trying to stimulate it with cheap money.  In the face of a possible economic downturn, large numbers of investors prefer the guarantee of a lower long-term yield that the uncertainty that would come with a higher short-term yield.  To quote one blog that I found to be credible: \u201c(Yield curve inversions) occur only when the market looks into the future and sees good evidence that the Fed will no longer tighten policy and will very likely ease policy at some point.\u201d Then this weekend I came across a seemingly opposite opinion on another blog.  To quote: \u201cAn inverted yield curve generally occurs as authorities hike interest rates to cool down an overheating economy.\u201d Judging by the comments about this blog post, a lot of people deem it credible. What is an outsider and relative newcomer to believe?  Is it any wonder that economists do so poorly on their own macro-economic forecasts? [It might be interesting to examine the recessions since 1980 and see if you could suss out what the Fed was saying and doing in each of the years leading up to a yield curve inversion.  I think the sample size is way too small \u2014 even if you go back to the end of WWII \u2014 to reach any definitive conclusions, but it might be interesting to take a look at.] That aside, there are some other narratives out there. In the same way that the bond market probably changed in some fundamental way around 1985 when the U.S. went from being a creditor nation to a debtor nation, it\u2019s possible that it has fundamentally changed once again since 2009 or so as a result of the quantitative easing (QE) that\u2019s taken place.   This is one of the themes I\u2019ve come across in my reading.  There is a school of thought that the Fed distorted the bond market with QE, and now the distortion continues with the advent of quantitative tightening, i.e., the release of bonds back into the market.   [And there\u2019s another interesting narrative that this has been exacerbated by the recent flood of Treasuries needed to pay for the rising federal debt.  One particular slant is that there has been far more short-term notes than long-term notes, which is affecting the curve.] There is a little-known, but apparently highly-regarded, fellow at  Deutsche Bank named Aleksandar Kocic who released a 28-page paper last Tuesday called, \u201cThrough the looking glass: Central bank adventures in convexity management.\u201d  The paper attempts to explain what\u2019s going on (and how the Fed can control it). Many of the technical details are a bit over my head, but the gist seems to be that, yes, the inelegant unwinding of Treasury holdings is the root of the problem. And this raises the question: Does the Fed really know what it\u2019s doing? Well, there are people who think not, and who think that THIS is the real problem. Recall that Jerome Powell is a different breed of Fed Chairman.  He comes from a market background, not an economics background like all other Fed Chairs before him.  His watch has been characterized as \u201cdata driven,\u201d as opposed to (I guess) theory-driven or policy-driven or history-driven. Among other things, people are pointing to what is often regarded as a ham-fisted comment in October that interest rates \u201care a long way from neutral,\u201d which helped precipitate the stock market dive.  And then the recent apparent attempt to step back from that by saying rates are \u201cjust below neutral.\u201d   So there are people who do believe that the Fed \u2014 on some fundamental level \u2014 doesn\u2019t really understand the situation or know what it is doing, and that it has inadvertently painted itself into a corner.  Jim Cramer (CNBC) went to far as to publicly caution the Fed about changing its mind on the promised December rate hike.  Cramer said that should the Fed change its mind and not give a December increase, then panic will sweep Wall Street.  Think about this: the Fed is apparently projecting such uncertainty and indecision in its very near-term actions that someone like Cramer is publicly saying, \u201cGet a grip!\u201d So basically I think the fundamental factor in play here is a huge degree of uncertainty.  There is the uncertainty of Brexit, the U.S./Chinese situation, riots in France, the Mueller investigation, oil price perturbations, etc., COMPOUNDED by a narrative that the Fed is groping around in the dark and might make a major mistake.

In general terms, the Fed has two principal missions: stimulate the economy and keep inflation in check.  The primary tool for achieving both is interest rate hikes.  Lower rates will stimulate the economy, higher rates will cool it down and keep inflation in check.  With respect to yield curve inversions, the conventional wisdom seems to be that an inversion happens when the Fed starts easing up on rate hikes.  The next layer of thinking is that if the Fed is easing up on rate hikes, it sees the economy slowing.  Hence, to stimulate the economy, it slows down or stop rate hikes.  When it does this, investors flee the short-term (hence drive up short-term yields) and seek safe haven in the long-term (hence drive down long-term yields). Yesterday Jerome Powell spoke (after the closing) and he said the economy is strong.  But he also stated that some communities have not fully shared in the benefits of it.  To me, this seems to leave the door open for further stimulation (i. e., slowing down rate hikes). One of the things that the Fed and everyone else watches very closely is employment.  Yesterday ADP released its estimate, and it projected a private sector employment increase in November of 179,000 nonfarm jobs.  Although this was smack dab in the middle of the consensus, it was a drop from October\u2019s 250,000 jobs gained.  Does that mean the economy is cooling?  Perhaps.  It could also mean that October\u2019s spike reflected pent up demand that got dampened by hurricane season.  Regardless, the Department of Labor\u2019s employment report comes out this morning, and it should provide more color on how bond investors view and interpret future Fed actions. One argument that the economy is, indeed, slowing is the housing market.  New home sales fell in October.  The new home sales slump has been going on all year, but last month\u2019s decline was particularly large.  (Prices have been declining, too.)  In addition, construction spending declined for the third straight month.  Combined with less-than-stellar job numbers, this would seem to hint at an economic slowdown.  And then there is international trade.  It\u2019s pretty clear that the so-called truce with China that came out of the G-20 meeting was more wishful thinking than anything else.  And the the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver for allegedly violating trade sanctions against Iran isn\u2019t going to help matters.  (I wonder if future historians will see this as the Archduke-Ferdinand-in-Sarajevo event of the 21st Century.) When you combine possibly tepid job growth with a housing slump and a looming trade war with one of our biggest trading partners, it\u2019s hard to see an economy that is, or will be, firing on all cylinders.   To me this speaks to a slowdown in rate hikes. So we\u2019ll get some clarity today on two things when the economic report comes out: jobs and inflation (via wage growth). If job growth is perceived to be low and wage growth (inflation) is low, it seems to me that it would be very hard for the Fed to continue along a path of multiple rate hikes next year.   But more fundamental \u2014 combined with the other factors \u2014 it would be hard to argue the economy still has its best years ahead of it.         And that is why I am sticking with 88% for now.

The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 74% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). \nSince this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I\u2019ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6.5 basis point (25 bps increase x 26% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 6.5 bps. At this point, I\u2019ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion. \nTheoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a term premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the term premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point. \nCurrent economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don\u2019t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I\u2019ll remain at 0% probability \nAnother thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I\u2019m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. \nOn the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question.  **Since my last forecast the equity market has continued to decline. In addition, the FedWatch probability of an increase has risen and then declined back to its current 74%. This leads me to believe that investor's inflation expectations have decreased and that's why both the 2 and 10 year rates have declined (10 yr moreso). The decrease in the Fedwatch and the equity markets might tell us that low inflationary fears have been incorporated into the 10 yr yield and if the Fed do not raise rates, the 2yr rate should decrease because the market had the probabilities wrong. Subsequently, the 10 yr rate would likely decrease because if increased fears of low inflation and likely invert. On the other hand if the Fed increases rates by 25 bps, the 2yr should increase by 18 bps (25 bps x 74% likelihood) which would also invert the curve at the current 13 bp spread. Though, increased inflation expectations would likely increase the 10 year enough to compensate and the curve would not invert. At this point, the spread is so small, that inversion is likely dependent on the Fed's decision. So, I'll stick with the FedWatch number and say 24% chance of inversion.  I\u2019ll add a somewhat arbitrary 10% points to my probability to account for the possibility of negative economic news or random exogenous event. For instance, heightened trade war threats or other negative geopolitical event.

And it seems that both the Hang Seng and the DAX fell substantially yesterday.  Now, in the U.S. pre-market, the sentiment seems to have stayed alive.

Although the actually numbers were right in the middle of the consensus estimate, they fall quite a bit short of last month's numbers.

The other news from yesterday \u2014 which I didn\u2019t think could be discounted \u2014 was the 90-day cease fire between the U.S. and China in the trade war.

And we have had the same, monthly averages starting July 2018 are: .2823, .2534, .2363, .2913, and .258. Will it make a big move downward in December? It's possible, but it's much less that the historical 15%. I'll come up to 5%, but I don't think it is more than a 1 in 20 chance. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y/"], [128, "2018-12-04T15:29:48Z", [0.06], ""], [128, "2018-12-04T15:29:03Z", [0.05], ""], [128, "2018-12-04T15:28:40Z", [0.04], ""], [57797, "2018-12-04T13:40:21Z", [0.12], ""], [1333, "2018-12-04T12:31:32Z", [0.2], "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/04/bond-market-treasury-yields-continue-slide-with-traders-wary-of-fed.html"], [30610, "2018-12-04T11:59:56Z", [0.1], "Increasing odds now that only 15bps gap between 2-10.

Since this challenge began, the spread has dropped from 0.30 (2.84 / 3.14) to 0.21.

So given that November\u2019s trend is toward an inversion (which is actually resuming a trend that was going on all year, and only changed in late-August), and that it\u2019s happening at a modestly rapid pace, I am ratcheting up the probability of an inversion a bit.

Two factors lead me to lower my forecast. The first is @Vichisky's comment on 25 November about the 18 bp contraction following the Lehman news in 2008.  That was a pretty monumental event, and it's difficult -- but not impossible -- to imagine a shock of greater magnitude between now and 31 December. The second is @OldWiseSage777's comment on 14 November about the velocity of change.  Again, it's not impossible to imagine some event turning the world in its head, but it's difficult at this point to imagine something that would increase rates of change to the point of an inversion before 31 December. There are a few things to keep in mind, though. First, the Fed's December rate hike seems to be pretty well baked in.  The last two sets of dot plots show a shift from eight to 12 FOMC members expecting a December rate hike, and the public comments of FOMC members in recent weeks indicate that's the course they're going to hold. But there seems to be a lot of pushback on further 2019 rate hikes.  So if the dot plot after the December meeting shows no sign of easing up on the rate hikes, that could have an effect on 2-year and 10-year rates in the waning days of 2018. Second, there's just so much unpredictable stuff going on in the world right now, from the China tariffs to the next step in Brexit to the Khashoggi situation. No telling where any of those might lead in the next five weeks. So for those two reasons I'm not willing to go below 5% at this point. Edit: I am editing this somewhat later to add that I think Donald Trump's public attacks on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell (most recently in an interview with the Washington Post that is running today) have a good chance of strengthening the Fed's resolve to continue rate hikes.  The Fed is supposed to be independent, and I don't think Powell or any of the other members want to be perceived as acquiescing to the President's desires.

My first impulse for developing a base case was to look at inversions since WWII.  My understanding is that the bond market before WWII was substantially different from what followed, and the post-war period struck me as a potentially good start point.  But I dropped that for several reasons... First, there really haven't been enough inversions since 1945 to make for a good sample size. Second, there appears to have been one or two fundamental shifts in the structure of the U.S. economy since WWII, meaning that inversions during the 1950s and 1960s might have different contributing factors than those in more recent years  And so the relevant sample size is quite possibly smaller still. Finally, in looking at the literature, the focus seems to be more on what follows an inversion (a recession) than on what factors contribute to it. So I'm not inclined to put too much weight on previous inversions. I think a more fitting approach is to divide the question into several other questions and try to answer them: Will the 2-year interest rate rise?  Will the 10-year interest rate drop?  Will the combination of rise and drop be enough to eliminate the current spread? So that's my next step. In the meantime, I've read through all the comments and forecasts, and in making my own initial forecast I'm using the mean average from a certain subset of other forecasters. The subset consists of those people who (a) gave a reasonable explanation for how they arrived at their forecasts, and (b) did not forecast 0% or 100% (I am a Cromwell's Rule kind of guy, and forecasting 0% or 100% is anathema to me.)   That's how I arrived at 11.3%.  It's a bit subjective, but it will stand for now. A couple of thoughts in the thread that I found interesting and worth thinking about as I move forward are the following: \u2022 The Fed has been telegraphing its intentions, and the market has baked that in already. \u2022 It would take something severe and unexpected to move the needle enough to cause an inversion.  That first bullet seems reasonable enough, and might be used to argue against significant interest rate changes in our time frame.  But I do not at all discount the possibility of a disruption in the next 41 days that's severe enough to put us over the top."], [30364, "2018-11-20T00:14:07Z", [0.0], ""], [21996, "2018-11-19T23:41:21Z", [0.08], ""], [62803, "2018-11-19T22:52:26Z", [0.03], "With the synchronized upward movement of rates following the most recent Fed action in September, the 2/10 spread has held relatively firm.

The CME Fedwatch website predicts Fed rate movements based on the futures market. Right, now it places a 76% probability that the Fed will raise rates at its December 18-19 meeting by 25 bps (https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html). \nSince this probability is well known and considered by bond investors, I\u2019ll say that the remaining 24% uncertainty is not already baked into the current 2 year rate and that there should only be a 6 basis point (25 bps increase x 24% of uncertainty) increase in the 2 year rate. If that happens, the 2 year adjusts accordingly, and the 10 year rate remains unchanged, the spread reduced to 20 bps. At this point, I\u2019ll assume a base rate of 0% probability of inversion.\nTheoretically, the yield curve should never invert because longer term investors demand a time premium. So, as the 2 year rate increases, the 10 year should increase by and unknown amount. Though, the time premium, as determined by the current spread is very small. In addition, an inversion is a very rare occurrence (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y). My probability remains 0% at this point.\nCurrent economic reports also lead bond investors to draw conclusions about rates in the future which can have a positive or negative effect on longer term yields. I don\u2019t claim to have any more incite about upcoming economic reports than anyone else, but we have to consider the short window before the question concludes. For instance, after the Fed announces its decision to raise rates (or to leave it unchanged or decrease), there are only 6 days (excluding holidays) until the question concludes. Thus, reducing the probability of inversion. So, I\u2019ll remain at 0% probability\nAnother thing to consider is that foreign countries are also investors in US debt markets. A few major economies have extremely low or negative rates and have found US debt to be more attractive from both yield and creditworthiness perspectives. Additional buying of US debt from these countries would put downward pressure on US yields. Since this situation has persisted for quite some time and would likely affect both the 2 and 10 year rates, I believe that if this assessment is correct the affects will have no further downward pressure on rates unless those rates were to decrease. I think this is very unlikely considering their central bank agendas. In addition, any rate increases in those countries would have upward pressure on rates, but that is very unlikely between now and the end of the question. I\u2019m not changing my probability because of this unless something significant happens. \nOn the other hand, because we are starting from such a historically small spread, any negative news or a continued bearish sentiment in equity markets could cause the 10 year rate to decrease and reduce the spread at any time between now and the end of the question. \nFor the final answer to remain at 0% seems foolish. I\u2019ll add a somewhat arbitrary 10% points to my probability to account for the possibility of negative economic news or random exogenous event. For instance, heightened trade war threats or other negative geopolitical event. I\u2019ll go with 10% for now.\n"], [61391, "2018-11-11T04:30:05Z", [0.05], ""], [62145, "2018-11-11T01:37:06Z", [0.7], ""], [62512, "2018-11-10T21:35:59Z", [0.1], "The 10-2 slope had been tightening  for a while, but has stabilized since mid-year.

EDIT AFTER CLOSE:\nIn 40 days the spread fell by 9bps from 30bps to 21bps. One note by an analysts I saw but unfortunately didn't save said that the 10-2 yield spread would tighten at a rate of 0.2bps per day, so 8bps over 40 days. Remarkably close to what transpired. However IMHO what guaranteed that an inversion did not happen was the Fed. comment of 19 Dec 2018 signalling a \"milder\" path. Without that it could have been touch and go.
