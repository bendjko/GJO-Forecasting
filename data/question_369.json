A visa-free border traffic agreement, which made travel between Russia and Poland easier for residents of the border area, was suspended last year ahead of a NATO summit in Warsaw and World Youth Day in Krak\u00f3w, southern Poland. Gazeta Polska Codziennie quoted the Polish interior ministry\u2019s Sebastian Chwa\u0142ek as saying: \u201cThe negative events which have intensified recently include growing militarization of the Kaliningrad enclave and increased activity of Russian special services\u201d. According to the daily, Russian media reported late last year that S-400 Triumf missile systems, which have a 400-km range and are able to seek out six targets at the same time, had been set up in the Kaliningrad enclave.

Many people living in the Polish border region have relatives and friends in Kaliningrad, and were able to travel repeatedly to the Russian enclave under the visa-free rules. The region also benefited economically from the visa-free border traffic, since many Russians came across the border to shop in Poland. Moreover, the province of Warmia-Masuria, like the rest of northeastern Poland, is the main focus of paramilitary, right-wing units, whose build-up Polish Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz has systematically encouraged over the last year. In November, the Sejm (parliament) agreed the creation of a territorial defence unit (WOT), comprising 53,000 men and to be concentrated mostly in the northeast and southeast of the country. Paramilitary organizations belonging to the radical right were explicitly encouraged to join the WOT. Among the forces the PiS wants to integrate into the state apparatus as part of this is the fascist ONR, which has sought to exploit the violence in E\u0142k.\nCOMMENT: There are an incredible amount of resources online to explore this tense and fascinating topic. It is a sad irony of history that the city where Kant dreamed up of perpetual peace faces bleak prospects of attaining it, and much larger ones of igniting war. Poland has to explain the exact security concerns of a closing that it initially justified as temporary for the World Youth Day, or it could be questioned for seeking petty economic advantages (see http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/267778,Kaliningrad-border-restrictions-%E2%80%98will-benefit-budget%E2%80%99-official) and a false sense of security, while sabotaging , for example, the 2018 World Cup. \nThe Riddle of Kaliningrad  Milosz J Zielinski\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12000374/The_Riddle_of_Kaliningrad Palmowski, T.

This isolation from the rest of Russia became even more pronounced politically when Poland and Lithuania became members of NATO and subsequently the European Union in 2004. All military and civilian land links between the region and the rest of Russia have to pass through members of NATO and the EU. Special travel arrangements for the territory's inhabitants have been made through the Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD).\nSince the early 1990s, the Kaliningrad oblast has been a Free Economic Zone (FEZ Yantar). In 1996, Kaliningrad was designated a Special Economic Zone, referred to as FEZ Yantar. Manufacturers based there get tax and customs duty breaks on the goods they send to other parts of Russia. Although corruption was an early deterrent, that policy means the region is now a manufacturing hub. One in three televisions in Russia is made in Kaliningrad (including Ericsson brand by Telebalt Ltd. and Polar by an eponymous firm located in the city of Chernyakhovsk) and it is home to Cadillac, Hummer and BMW related car plants (produced by Avtotor). Currently, Kaliningrad's major industries are manufacturing, shipping, fishing and amber products. In 2006, Moscow declared it would turn the region into \"the Russian Hong Kong\". The European Commission provides funds for business projects under its special programme for Kaliningrad. With an average GDP growth of more than 10% per year for three years to 2007, Kaliningrad grew faster than any other region in Russia, even outstripping the success of its EU neighbours. By early 2015, the BBC reported the region's trade with the countries of the EU was increasing, with improved economic growth and industrial output. Poland and the Russian Federation have an arrangement whereby residents of Kaliningrad and the Polish cities of Olsztyn, Elbl\u0105g and Gda\u0144sk may obtain special cards permitting repeated travel between the two countries, crossing the Polish\u2013Russian border. As of July 2013, Poland had issued 100,000 of the cards. That year, Russians visiting Poland to shop at the Biedronka and Lidl supermarkets featured in songs by musical group Parovoz. In 2004 Germany opened a consulate general in Kaliningrad. This consulate allows Kaliningrad residents to get Schengen visas without having to travel to Moscow. An agreement between Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Chancellor of Germany, and President of Russia Vladimir Putin established the consulate in light of Lithuania and Poland, which surround Kaliningrad, joining the EU. Russian concerns with Germany wanting the former K\u00f6nigsberg back had stifled earlier plans for a German consulate. In July 2007, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov declared that if US-controlled missile defense systems were deployed in Poland, then nuclear weapons might be deployed in Kaliningrad. On November\u00a05, 2008, Russian leader Dmitry Medvedev said that installing missiles in Kaliningrad was almost a certainty. These plans were suspended, however, in January 2009. But during late 2011, a long range Voronezh radar was commissioned to monitor missile launches within about 6,000 kilometres (3,728 miles). It is situated in the settlement of Pionersky (formerly German Neukuhren) in Kaliningrad Oblast.\n___________________________\nCOMMENTS:  To that scenario we now have the US and its Nato allies will send battalions of up to 1,200 to each of the three Baltic states \u2013 Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 and Poland by spring this year, reports the New York Times.
