Whether that is biasing my interpretation of the case, I'm not certain, but it probably does to some degree. From what I can read of the positions, that of the US government (as well as the supporting views of the states) seems to centre around arguments involving what Congress would have intended when they passed the relevant legislation in 1986 had they known the pace of technological advances and that private corporations should not be able to circumvent domestic law enforcement by decisions on where they locate data (which they claim is a purely business decision). The supporting brief by the states seems to also focus on the practice of splitting emails into different packets of data which are stored in different locations, thereby making the current process of international law enforcement cooperation (through bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties, which the US currently has with Ireland) untenable since the data is moved between locations too rapidly and obtaining the entire email is unduly difficult. Microsoft's position appears to be that Congress in 1986 didn't give law enforcement express permission to do this (not contested by US gov.), meaning that with the common international and SCOTUS presumption against extra-territoriality that Congress should be the one to create nuanced law on this issue rather than using the blunt hammer of the courts (which, according to Microsoft and some of the supporting briefs, Congress are currently doing). In addition, they argue that the US gov. position that the warrant is effectively a subpoena and should be governed as such is incorrect since it treats private individuals personal data entrusted to Microsoft's care as if it were merely business information owned by Microsoft themselves. Microsoft points to the entirety of the relevant legislation passed in 1986 as being primarily concerned with ensuring the privacy of this data from erosion of rights by the courts rather than with ensuring such data is passed to law enforcement.  Most of the briefs submitted seemed to be generally in support of Microsoft's position (although they were not necessarily submitted in support of Microsoft, but rather warning against the consequences of the US gov.'s proposal), such as that submitted by a collection of former national security, law enforcement, and intelligence community officials of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France as well as numerous briefs submitted by foreign governments and privacy advocates within the US. Overall, its clear that this case has a lot of potential repercussions and finding a solution to them all may not be possible simply through judicial review of existing outdated legislation. A lot of how this case goes forward depends on Congress: if Congress is seen to be making clear moves towards updating the existing legislation on this issue, then I have no doubt that SCOTUS will postpone the case or dismiss it entirely. However, if Congress is seen to be either unable or unwilling to do this then SCOTUS could end up coming down on either side: the court is relatively conservative and so may be more concerned with the effects on law enforcement's ability to pursue domestic cyber criminals (which the states' brief is clearly trying to point to, by focusing so heavily on pedophilia). On the other hand, the presumption against extra-territoriality is a longstanding position of both SCOTUS and international law so it may be rejected for that reason as well as privacy concerns. Given the large number of unknowns here, I've opted for a 1/5 chance that the court rules against Microsoft. I would have put it lower, but as stated the court is relatively conservative and a number of long-standing precedents have been reversed by SCOTUS in the last couple of decades leading to a degree of uncertainty about the outcome.
