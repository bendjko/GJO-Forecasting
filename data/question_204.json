This seems weird, since the car is nowhere to be seen on the road.\n-- The Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg has discovered that 91% (all of 2015 so far) or 99% (October 2015) of new Soul EVs in Germany were first registered to Kia dealers.\n-- 2/3 of Soul EVs in Norway are \"used\" cars imported from Germany. Norway is a huge market for electric vehicles in general.\n-- Kia dealers in DE register the Soul and sell in Norway as a used car\n-- CO2 emission supercredits only count for the region where the vehicle is first registered.\n-- According to the KBA, average emissions for all Kia vehicles sold in Germany dropped from 128 g CO2 to 112 g CO2 from September to October. According to the SPIEGEL, this is primarily achieved by the phantom EV registrations.\n-- According to T&E (Transport & Environment, an NGO), Kia-Hyundai manages to avoid paying a \u20ac70m penalty by using this trick and staying 0.9 grams below the 131 gram CO2 limit. The DE subsidy requires ownership for 9 months, so not likely to respond to subsidy. I cannot verify \"supply issues\" keeping Soul sales low in  Q1 2016. April 2016 sales for the Kia Soul were 98 in Norway vs 24 in Germany.

There is quite a lot of opposition against the proposal - from their own 'scientific advisory council', among others - but it seems they will go ahead anyway and add some tax-deductions too.
