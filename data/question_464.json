Nigeria\nSince launching its brutal insurgency in 2009, Islamic militant group Boko Haram has devastated entire villages and communities in northeast Nigeria. But the scale of the food crisis only came to light as more areas in the region that were once under Boko Haram\u2019s control become accessible to government and aid workers (para 7.)\nLast year, the United Nations children's fund estimated a quarter of a million children in northeast Nigeria\u2019s Borno state are severely malnourished and many are facing death. This year, Oxfam estimates 340,000 people will face food insecurity and 12,000 children will suffer from acute malnutrition.\nBut the severity of the region's food shortages is obscured when you look at Nigeria's national score on the 2017 Global Hunger Index. Nigeria ranked 84 out of the 119 countries assessed. Its hunger level, falling in the \"serious\" category, is more than 15 percent lower this year than it was 17 years ago. That does not fully reflect the vast inequality within the West African nation's borders. Child stunting ranges from 7.6 percent to 63.4 percent by region, according to the report. Timing also played a factor in why Nigeria did not receive a higher hunger level, the report said. Global Hunger Index scores are based on the most up-to-date information available for four component indicators: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality. For this year's scores, data was included from the most recent reference period, 2012 to 2016, and thus reflects hunger and malnutrition in this period. The extent of the unfolding crisis in northeast Nigeria will be reflected in future Global Hunger Index indicators and scores, the report added (para 7-11). Winsor, M. (2017).

No immediate Council outcome is anticipated (para. 1). Key Recent Developments\nOn 21 February, the Secretary-General sent a letter to UN member states highlighting the global food crisis and the risk of famine in north-east Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. He noted that without decisive action over 20 million people in these countries faced the risk of famine within six months. While maintaining that the UN and its partners had \u201ccomprehensive programmers\u2019, clear strategic plans\u2026and strong teams on the ground\u201d, he underscored the importance of \u201cfurther voluntary contributions\u2026to meet the unprecedented scale of needs across the globe\u201d. On 10 March, then-Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen O\u2019Brien briefed the Council on the visit he had recently completed to Yemen, South Sudan and Somalia\u2014countries that he described as \u201cfacing, or at risk of, famine\u201d\u2014and on the outcome of the 24 February Oslo donor conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin. O\u2019Brien told the Council that the world was facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the UN\u2019s establishment. He commended donors who had pledged a total of $672 million for humanitarian aid at the Oslo conference and urged others to contribute as well (para 1-3). On 21 September, OCHA and the World Bank co-hosted a high-level event on famine prevention and response on the margins of the General Assembly General Debate. During the meeting, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted that since his call for action in February to respond to the threat of famine in north-east Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, 60 percent of the $4.9 billion needed for urgent humanitarian operations had been received. However, he added, people\u2019s needs in each of these countries had increased, more funding was required, and efforts needed to be made to influence the parties to conflict to allow for safe humanitarian access (para 6).

They are the latest victims of Boko Haram's Islamic insurgency. No one knows how many more children are dying of starvation in refugee camps and areas too dangerous to access because of the extremists' presence, according to Doctors Without Borders, which runs the emergency feeding center. The aid group first sounded the alarm of a humanitarian crisis of \"catastrophic\" proportion in northeast Nigeria as Boko Haram lost its grip on some areas and its victims began to emerge. \"These are kids that basically have been hungry all their lives, and some are so far gone that they die here in the first 24 hours,\" said Jean Stowell, an American midwife in charge of the center in Maiduguri, the biggest city in this largely Muslim region. The 110-bed center has quadrupled in size in recent weeks, but each time it expands it rapidly fills. Nearly a quarter of a million children are severely malnourished because Boko Haram has disrupted trade and farming, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Toby Lanzer warned at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday. About 2 million people in the region have not been reached, \"and we can't assess their situation. We can estimate that it's awful\" (para 4). With Nigeria in a recession and without speedy outside help, \"we will see, I think, a famine unlike any we have ever seen anywhere,\" he said. One million refugees from Boko Haram are crowded into camps in Maiduguri. Outside the camps, fresh produce is cruelly bountiful. Markets are filled with pineapples, oranges, cabbage, green beans, tomatoes and carrots. But most refugees cannot afford them, and Nigeria's government is investigating reports of officials stealing food aid. Elsewhere, 1 million children are trapped in areas too dangerous to reach because of Boko Haram, the U.N. children's agency estimates. Its effort to reach some of them was put on hold in July when the extremists attacked a military-escorted humanitarian convoy on a major highway and a rocket hit the windshield of an armored car.

Of Yemen\u2019s 27.4 million population, 18.8 million are in need of emergency assistance, with near 7 million on the brink of starvation. In northeastern Nigeria, where scarcity of food has not historically been a problem, 5.1 million people now find themselves food insecure as a consequence of a devastating insurgency. After the drought that hit Somalia in 2011, claiming the lives of an estimated 250,000 people, the country is now undergoing another, leaving 5.5 million in urgent need of food aid. The South Sudanese government has declared famine in portions of the country, while the UN says that nearly 5.5 million people are staring down starvation. While natural disasters and severe weather patterns have significant impacts on the availability of food, humanitarian assistance flows have recently shifted from providing global aid to victims of natural disasters, to now primarily assisting victims of violent conflict. The implications are clear: the displacement of persons, disruption of markets, decline of governance, and destruction of infrastructure caused by violent conflict can have a devastating impact on the vulnerability of populations to food insecurity. With the administration of President Donald Trump proposing major cuts to U.S. food aid programs \u2013 that not only facilitate U.S. policy influence abroad, but also help sustain U.S. agricultural and shipping industries \u2013 the future of U.S. food aid is in flux. Trump\u2019s appointment for executive director of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, has said the organization is \u201cthe first line of offense and defense against extremism and terrorism.\u201d The reasoning? \u201cIf a family can\u2019t feed their children, after two or three weeks, they will turn to any available resource they can, and is usually extremism,\u201d Beasley said in relation to displaced civilians following the battle to push ISIS from Mosul in Iraq. In announcing the administration\u2019s strategy in Afghanistan last month, Trump declared, \u201cwe are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.\u201d But ignoring the drivers that perpetuate the conflict does little to make tangible progress in advancing Trump\u2019s strategic goals of \u201cobliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge.\u201d  The coordinating body of the international community\u2019s efforts in the country, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, has specifically said that \u201cthere is a possibility that high food prices may be making young men more vulnerable for recruitment by anti-government elements, including the Taliban.\u201d It is difficult to determine whether food insecurity can alone lead to the onset of violent conflict.  However, there is evidence that food insecurity can prolong internal violence by forcing vulnerable populations to make difficult decisions for their immediate safety during times of war. Despite the possibility that food insecurity could contribute to militant group recruitment, humanitarian workers don\u2019t wish to be viewed as supporting a particular faction because it can undermine the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence. One role that these principles play is to enable safe passage of aid workers to deliver assistance to those caught in the crossfire of war. Should certain factions view the delivery of assistance as detrimental to their efforts, or seek to take it for themselves, they could turn to violence against aid workers. Knowing where these populations are and reaching them \u2013 whether because of inaccessibility from poor infrastructure and governance or due to the threat of violence \u2013 is a constant challenge. At least 79 aid workers have been killed in South Sudan since the beginning of the civil war in 2013. As of March, only 1.9 million of the 5.1 million in need of food aid in northeast Nigeria are being reached, in part, because of the Nigerian military\u2019s heavy handed response and restrictions on civilian movement. To overcome these barriers, aid workers must look to advances in technology to better assess the situation on the ground as well as deliver food aid without fear of violence or the siphoning of aid due to government corruption. Technology traditionally developed by militaries can help humanitarian organizations mitigate these challenges. \u201cThe good news,\u201d says Scott Aughenbaugh, a Research Fellow with the Center for Technology and National Security Policy at National Defense University, \u201cis that many of the same types of technologies and techniques the U.S. military has developed or is developing for reconnaissance and intelligence analysis, such as satellites, big data analytics, and drones, are also part of a new generation of tools for monitoring, predicting, and preventing food crises.\u201d Perhaps the most prominent of these initiatives is the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which aggregates atmospheric and meteorological data, satellite imagery, and other inputs and then leverages predictive analytics tools to give early warning to emerging or likely crises. Satellite imagery can identify isolated populations, which can then be reached using drones capable of delivering aid and providing farming assistance. Perhaps further down the road is the impact conflict, population growth, and climate change are having on urbanization. Those fleeing conflict-ridden countrysides are seeking refuge and economic opportunity in cities around the world, placing a cumbersome burden on out-of-date urban infrastructure and food supply. Some \u201c60 percent of the world\u2019s cropland lies just on the outskirts of cities,\u201d says Johanna Mendelson Forman, a Distinguished Fellow at the Stimson Center. \u201cChina is expected to lose one-quarter of the global cropland because of the expansion of cities into peri-urban areas that once were the source of local farming and food supplies. The disappearance of productive land near urban centers will impact the availability of staple crops like maize, rice, soy, and wheat \u2013 the basis of global food security.\u201d With burgeoning population growth and conflict, and climate migrants flooding to cities, governments must turn to technological advances, such as vertical farms and drone farmers, to better enable urban dwellers to produce, store, and deliver the food they need. \u201cFailure to address these challenges in the short run will create conditions that are ripe for more conflicts and more climate migrants,\u201d argues Mendelson Forman. \u201cWe could be looking at new era of urban food wars if we do not address the issues of how to feed 9 billion people by mid-century.\u201d While the relationship between conflict and food insecurity is multi-faceted and difficult to pinpoint, it is clear the connection is there. \u201cUsing innovative technologies to combat food insecurity is a cost-effective and efficient strategy to reduce political instability abroad and make us safer at home,\u201d says Aughenbaugh.\" Levi Maxey is a cyber and technology analyst at The Cipher Brief.

In much of the northeast, income-generating opportunities are extremely limited due to conflict-related disruptions to normal livelihoods patterns. Large populations in accessible areas are highly dependent on humanitarian assistance for food access. Large areas of the northeast are expected to continue face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes, although some moderate improvements in food security outcomes for some are expected after harvests in October. 2)  Despite some improvement in the security situation in areas near major towns in northeastern Nigeria, many areas remain inaccessible to humanitarian agencies. It is likely civilian populations remaining in these areas are experiencing similar or worse conditions to neighboring, accessible areas, and as such there is an ongoing risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) in inaccessible areas of Borno State. 3)  Humanitarian agencies have scaled-up their response to the food security situation in the northeast, reaching over two million people with food assistance in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States in June 2017. However, the response plan elaborated by the food security sector for 2017 was only 24 percent funded as of May 2017, and humanitarian agencies have already reduced operations in some LGAs. As many households in accessible areas of the northeast have very few income-generating opportunities and face very high food prices, they will remain highly dependent on humanitarian assistance throughout the outlook period. 4)  The rainy season has started with near-normal timing and cumulative rainfall across most of Nigeria. Outside of the northeast, staple harvests that begin as late as October in northern areas are likely to be greater than last year, due to increased access to inputs as well as strong production incentives for farmers due to very high staple food prices. There continue to be strong, conflicting events...Nigeria is entering harvest season, rainfall is as expected and high food prices are driving production.  Conflict continues and the central governments monetary efforts will put pressure on positive events.

Aid groups and Nigerian officials at times have been at odds in their approaches to the vast crisis in the country's northeast, where millions have been uprooted during Boko Haram's deadly eight-year insurgency. \"The humanitarian crisis in Nigeria's northeast is one of the most severe in the world today,\" Edward Kallon, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Nigeria, said in a statement. \"I am extremely concerned that these actions could be detrimental to the critical work that is being carried out every day to support the most vulnerable in the region, and I call upon the government of Nigeria to provide clarification.\" Local media reported that large numbers of soldiers surrounded the U.N. building in Maiduguri on Friday morning searching for arms. The U.N. said the search lasted three hours before the soldiers departed. It said it had no information \"regarding the reason or motivations for the unauthorized search\" (para. 1-4). The continuing unrest has created a vast hunger crisis in northeast Nigeria as markets and agriculture are disrupted and many people fear returning home, even as the government claims that security is returning (para. 13). The U.N. says more than 50 non-governmental aid groups are working in Nigeria's northeast to help nearly 7 million people in need, and that funding appeals are badly met so far.

The following month the Niger government issued an emergency appeal for food aid. The appeal, and the ones that followed, noted the head of UN humanitarian operations, Under-Secretary General Jan Egeland, were met by a \u201cnear-deafening silence.\u201d\n(http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/october-2005/niger-famine-foretold)  Whilst the main cause of famine in Nigeria is conflict, high food prices and lack of income make many people affected dependent on aid. The urgency for aid is clear in the statistics, but the international community have yet to raise sufficient funds to \u201ccombat\u201d the crisis, possibly due to the number of other countries also facing severe shortages.  When comparing the Niger food crisis to the current situation in Nigeria, the reactions to reports from both the then Niger President, Mamdou Tandja, and Nigerian President Buhari, were similar. \nPresident Tandja \u201cclaimed reports of the looming food crisis in the west African country were \"false propaganda\" that had been used by the UN, aid agencies and opposition parties for political and economic gain\u201d (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/10/famine.hearafrica05) \nWhilst President Buhari, back in December 2016, said: \u201cThe hype, especially that which suggests that the government is doing nothing is, therefore, uncharitable and unnecessary. We are concerned about the blatant attempts to whip up a nonexistent fear of mass starvation by some aid agencies, a type of hype that does not provide a solution to the situation on the ground but more to do with calculations for operations financing locally and abroad.\u201d \n(https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/world/africa/niger-nigeria-boko-haram-food-crisis.html?_r=0) \nGiven that President Buhari is out of the country due to illness, and an acting President has been appointed, I\u2019m uncertain as to how much progress will be made with relation to food aid.

Boko Harem is contained, international help is underway etc.; so, paradoxically, media coverage on the subject could be a sign for preventing famine.\n\t\u00a0\nI also would like to comment on @boz comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/494347\n\u00b7 The first two points point to Nigeria's reputation and influence\u2026 I am not sure about the preferences of Nigerias Gov since it could also help Nigeria to have a famine declaration by the UN (resources, help, media coverage concerning a problem they cannot handle due to their failing and failed states characteristics; and democratic norm may not hinder the declaration of a humanitarian catastrophe); I am also not sure whether they have so much influence to prevent a declaration.\n\u00b7 The third point on resources goes both ways as @boz admits.\n\u00b7 The points on FEWSNET are striking, however.\n\u00b7 The last point on the UN is a little overdrawn. However, it could well be that the UN is trying to avoid a noisy declaration, i.e. that is not valid - as I pointed out above.\n\t\u00a0\nAll in all: it is a very hard question. Given the momentum of the situation to become worse and worse, the chances are above the 50 percent threshold. But it is far from certain. My guess is that we are around 66 to 80 percent.\nThe most serious problem is that we seem to know very little on how the decision processes on famine declaration are organized and which stakeholders do a power play, which preferences they have, how much salience these preference have to them and how much influence they can have\u2026 \nAlso we lack the understanding of the dynamics of famine crisis, e.g.: How likely is it that a famine can be prevented once it was diagnosed as (very) likely to happen and thereby mobilizing international help to prevent it?\n\t\u00a0\n--> Does anyone have ideas on that?"], [1034, "2017-05-21T06:41:59Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-20T19:00:43Z", [1.0], ""], [34353, "2017-05-20T16:13:38Z", [0.85], ""], [1034, "2017-05-20T07:40:11Z", [1.0], ""], [1479, "2017-05-20T06:25:06Z", [1.0], ""], [29145, "2017-05-20T03:30:19Z", [0.51], ""], [35520, "2017-05-19T23:25:53Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-05-19T22:39:47Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2017-05-19T19:28:42Z", [0.95], ""], [34353, "2017-05-19T11:41:09Z", [0.85], ""], [4634, "2017-05-19T09:02:05Z", [0.85], ""], [4634, "2017-05-19T09:01:48Z", [0.82], ""], [28414, "2017-05-19T08:49:43Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-05-19T07:54:07Z", [1.0], "Allen-Ebrahimian, B.

This, coupled with the required funds not being met and corruption will only exacerbate the situation to the point that the Nigerian government could no longer \u201chide\u201d it (if that is what they attempt to do) and would have to declare a famine.  Some forecasters have mentioned that the UN is particularly slow in dealing with these situations and areas that are remote (e.g. Banki) do not get the required attention. However, reading an article on the Thomas Reuters Foundation site (http://news.trust.org/item/20170505105728-wfamo/) on the situation in Nigeria. Peter Lundberg, the author of the article said: \u201cI recently visited several areas across Borno State, which were previously completely inaccessible for humanitarian actors.

That's halfway through the reporting period here.\n* There are a clear set of criteria for a level 5 famine declaration and the areas that could hit level 5 in 2017 are remote and inaccessible, meaning data collection will be difficult and behind the curve.\n* The UN is culturally slow to act and reluctant to admit errors when it makes them. That makes timely declarations harder. My 61% is an \"optimistic\" assessment that the UN will be proactive in getting this declaration done in spite of political pressure and a lack of complete data.

This can be broken into a series of sub-questions A. Will a famine actually occur in any part of Nigeria in 2017? 40% probability. The areas at greatest risk of famine are the inaccessible areas of the northeast. Based on an analysis by FEWS NET, Famine likely occurred in some of these areas in 2016 (http://www.fews.net/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FEWS%20NET%20Borno%20%20Analysis_20161213release.pdf). The primary driver of Famine in this case was insecurity related movement restrictions. Today, access to many areas remains limited for humanitarians and traders. Prices remain very high due to currency depreciation. On the other hand, many of the inaccessible areas have depopulated (voluntarily or by force),  the level of emergency response has increased substantially in accessible areas, mitigating food insecurity, and the blockade tactics of the military seem less prevalent than last year.  B. Will assessment teams collect the data required to make a famine declaration? (40% probability) Collection of representative food security, nutrition and mortality data remains limited, even in accessible areas. When it is collected, it is often collected at the senatorial zone level making it difficult to assess how severe food insecurity is in the worst affected areas. The military is unlikely to grant full access to the areas of concern and rapid assessments, even when representative, collect mortality data infrequently. However, access to some previously inaccessible areas has been increasing. C. If evidence of severe food insecurity is collected, will national-level partners use this evidence to make a Famine declaration? (60 percent) There is little political willingness among national food security partners to talk about famine, though high quality representative evidence might force their hand. D. If national level partners determine that a famine is occurring, will the UN then declare a famine? (90%) The UN does not make famine determinations, however they will declare famines that are identified by national level groups.

These concerns are not restriction to Nigeria but also include Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen.  It has made an appeal of $4B, to start, in order to ameliorate the immediate and short term needs of these states.   Even if the appeal is met, it is likely that increased factors will increase needed conditions for amelioration.  Of major concern is not only the problem of food security but the attendant and likely instability and fragility that will occur in these  states;  with current or base rate instability and fragility in all four states, further deterioration (including the likely loss of millions of citizens, refugees and other displaced people in these countries) are anticipated.  A famine has already been declared by the UN in February for parts of South Sudan.  Human Insecurity resulting in famine and deaths including diminishing supplies of water, among other factors, drive the concerns of political stability  and fragility.  While these two factors have been of concern for some time the base rate in the states are increasing problematic from a policy point of view; with weak resilience under fragility the e,pit is imply an horizon of exponential crises.
