Therefore, it is highly unlikely (95-99%) that the government shifts the weekend to Saturday-Sunday by 2022. Doing such a move could backlash politically, also from other Muslim countries.  On the other side, recently the government has been more flexible on Islamic rules by decriminalising the consumption of alcohol and cohabitation. This summer Dubai also allowed restaurants to stay open during Ramadan. And shifting the weekend would allow the country to be more in sync with Western weekends.  If the government announces a change to the weekend, it will most likely be a half-day on Friday, which is not that convenient. Would people have 2 half days and 1 full day off work?
