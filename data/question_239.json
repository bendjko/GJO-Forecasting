The current pound exchange rate is telling us that markets believe that things are very bad in the UK. OK, on to my prediction change.  We appear to have stabilized around 1.22 pounds per dollar.  Assuming this remains true, and adding in random movement in the exchange rate, that would argue for greater than 1.2 but less than 1.3 being slightly above 50%, and lower than 1.2, being somewhat below 50%, and both buckets being the only option.

This is driven by both US and UK forces. On the UK side, Brexit has clearly changed this rate, and since Brexit the rate has been around 1.30 on average. Recently the value has decreased again, apparently driven by a 'hard brexit' becoming a reality through multiple sources (May speech, EU leaders etc). It is unlikely that information will come to light to bring the rate back to previous levels before negotiations begin. However, the autumn statement may produce some relief with potential announcements of infrastructure investments and trade strategies outside the EU, and given the previous rate post Brexit was 1.3, I don't rule out it being between 1.3-1.4. It could also be the case that as prices in supermarkets are effected, as has started to happen, public opinion may shift, making a 'soft brexit' more likely, which could boost GBP. Again, this means 1.3-1.4 should not be discounted.  However I still see this chance as low as uncertainty is unlikely to decrease. Between now and 30 Dec, EU leaders may position themselves in a tough stance against the UK, meaning the value could drop further. The 'flash crash' also shows that uncertainty is high, increasing the chances of future decreases. The flash crash may also have provided the impetus for those concerned about Brexit to sell, meaning GBP may level out around current levels (1.21).  On the US side, it looks unlikely that Trump will be elected, which would have swung the exchange rate in GBP's favour. However, this is still possible and therefore provides further reason to think 1.3-1.4 is not impossible. It is unclear to what extent the markets have factored the US election into their current forecast as recent price changes appear to have been dominated by Brexit globally, and it is therefore possible that a Clinton election would boost the US dollar and drive the exchange rate against Sterling further (there may also be no change).  Overall I see it as being more likely to decrease than increase, and based on the current rate of 1.21, less than 1.2 is most likely."], [29599, "2016-10-16T15:01:30Z", [0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [21180, "2016-10-16T13:28:39Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-16T11:30:30Z", [0.0, 0.64, 0.36, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2016-10-16T10:16:43Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10924, "2016-10-16T03:30:41Z", [0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10612, "2016-10-16T03:23:43Z", [0.56, 0.43, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14166, "2016-10-15T21:27:52Z", [0.37, 0.5, 0.1, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [15690, "2016-10-15T18:45:43Z", [0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [2965, "2016-10-15T15:13:33Z", [0.11, 0.86, 0.03, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15548, "2016-10-15T12:37:42Z", [0.32, 0.68, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-15T12:22:46Z", [0.0, 0.64, 0.36, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27729, "2016-10-15T10:37:21Z", [0.12, 0.61, 0.27, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27798, "2016-10-15T04:48:50Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28067, "2016-10-15T01:45:51Z", [0.6, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], "Brexit negotiations begin in March 2017.

For what's it worth, here are some arguments why I think the largest probability is still for the 1.2-1.3 bucket. Would be interested in arguments in favor of the 1.3-1.4 bucket - the consensus still gives that one a 35% probability. As always, if the facts change, I am always willing to change my view :): - Economic perspective: as capital flows into the UK are going to slow, the pound is rightly depreciating to help the current account deficit decline. But if the IMF's \"limited scenario\" (see Table 1 on p. 32 in http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2016/cr16169.pdf ) is right, the external trade deficit (a large part of the current account deficit) is going to decline quite a bit in 2017 as the economy weakens, with only limited depreciation (5-15 percent on a real effective basis). As we are at the upper bound of this range already, I judge a sustained decline below 1.2 (some 18% decline from the June 22 level of 1.47) not very likely by end-2016 (it may still happen in 2017, though). - financial market perspective: JPM now forecasts the pound at 1.21 by end-2016 (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-10/pound-fails-to-shake-off-wounded-image-after-week-of-flash-crash). It's likely that their traders target this level as well (yes, it's close to 1.2, but still above). Roubini Global Economics predicted 1.22 as well. Moreover, the sharp decline in the past week indicates that many investors were caught longer in the pound that they would like. Once they adjust their positions, and/or shorting the pound becomes crowded, this trade would be vulnerable to sharp rebounds.  - international/policy perspective: markets expect with large probability that the Fed will raise rates once by end-2016 (in Dec.). On the other hand, it's not quite clear what the Bank of England will do in this timeframe. Given the pound's weakness (which amounts to some relaxation of monetary conditions) and the resilience in the real economy indicators, it's likely that they do not relax policy further in this timeframe. I don't think this has been entirely absorbed by the markets. \n"], [691, "2016-10-10T18:18:10Z", [0.0, 0.59, 0.41, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25190, "2016-10-10T17:57:05Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29469, "2016-10-10T16:23:36Z", [0.73, 0.27, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Base information: Price today = 1.23.

Its the typical talk of populists and economies run on populist rhetoric tend to have currency collapses.  \nIf currency traders see a drop in a currency as a one way bet, then it takes a significant event to change and stop the fall being a self fulfilling prophesy. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/oct/07/flash-crash-in-pound-spooks-investors-business-live\nhttp://www.scmp.com/business/money/money-news/article/2025974/pound-hammered-after-hollande-promises-tough-stance-brexit\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mark-carney-seeks-to-downplay-talk-of-rift-with-theresa-may-on-money-printing-a7348961.html\n"], [2965, "2016-10-07T09:36:54Z", [0.21, 0.72, 0.07, 0.0, 0.0], "TANKING 6% IN EARLY ASIAN TRADING BEFORE COMING BACK ABOVE 1.20\nreason May announcement of date to begin negotiations for Brexit is moving markets and, with Brexit proceeding it will slide but now closer to  1.20 level not 1.30 level.\nSo I changed the forecast."], [212, "2016-10-07T08:56:06Z", [0.03, 0.59, 0.38, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1708, "2016-10-07T08:13:20Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/pound-plunges-6-1-percent-in-biggest-drop-since-brexit-result?cmpid=wsdemand"], [15196, "2016-10-07T07:44:29Z", [0.35, 0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25190, "2016-10-07T07:26:40Z", [0.25, 0.7, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [10759, "2016-10-07T06:53:25Z", [0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [4634, "2016-10-07T06:53:12Z", [0.15, 0.7, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27299, "2016-10-07T06:40:14Z", [0.01, 0.4, 0.59, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15621, "2016-10-07T05:31:16Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Down down down?"], [5001, "2016-10-07T04:22:58Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.34, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [28631, "2016-10-07T04:00:17Z", [0.09, 0.58, 0.33, 0.0, 0.0], "after flash crash"], [10898, "2016-10-07T03:10:22Z", [0.13, 0.59, 0.27, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [10898, "2016-10-07T02:49:27Z", [0.08, 0.55, 0.36, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [73, "2016-10-07T02:41:11Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14253, "2016-10-07T01:11:38Z", [0.2, 0.66, 0.14, 0.0, 0.0], "I know this insane crash, in basically after-market hours, is algorithm driven and may correct, but I'm going up to 20% on sub-1.20 until I see some more substantial correction.

This implies a weaker GBP.\nThe FED backed off from raising, and might threaten to raise again, but the odds are that the FED will hold off till after the election. Least likely they will lower rates. \nSo, central bank relative pressure argues for a weaker GBP. \nSince we're at 1.30 today, right on one of the lines, I'd say that its about 55% to 60% that the rate will be lower: (first two options), and about 40%-45% that it'll be higher (next three options). \nOver 1.40 is a tail outcome, but less than 1.20 is slightly fatter tail. \nPutting this together, let's say:\n5% over 1.40\n15% under 1.20\nThe 80% in the range, I'll assign as: 45%:35%, favoring the lower rate\n"], [368, "2016-08-06T19:08:15Z", [0.0, 0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [27763, "2016-08-06T14:20:56Z", [0.2, 0.6, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], "As widely expected, the BoE slashed base rates to 0.25%, and noted the sluggishness in the British economy. Benchmark 10-year UK gilt yields fell to 0.63%, and the GBP weakened. The updated forecast is a function of these developments. Two opposing forces are likely to influence the future path of the GBP.  1) Lower rates, and expectations of a weakening economy relative to the US economy, may influence further weakening in the GBP through December'16. Contingent on evolving positive development in the US economy, and signs of weakness in the UK economy, the GBP may continue on a downward trajectory. It seems unlikely, at this stage, that the GBP may experience an incremental 8-10% depreciation from present levels through Dec'16; necessitating a rethink in my probability weights. Part of the reason for a high probability in the original forecast was to account for the likelihood of a 'risk-off' posture towards GBP post Brexit.  2) Return of GBP's 'safe haven', and 'relative positive yielder' status among developed markets may cause the GBP to stem its depreciating trend.\nThe latest round of QE may have a similar effect on the GBP as  the JPY's experience with Abenomics after 2013. The monetary expansion in Japan helped weaken the JPY versus the USD over the subsequent two years. However, once the JPY's 'safe haven' status was re-established, the JPY appreciated versus the USD.\nThe 10-year UK gilt still offers a positive yield, compared to near-zero or negative yields in other developed market sovereign debt. Additionally, with the BoE's impending purchase of government debt, and Mark Carney's assertions against dipping into negative interest rate territory, may help put a base under the GBP. In this scenario, the GBP may not only plateau around current levels; but may evolve on an appreciating trend through Dec'16. The updated probabilities reflect these thoughts, as of the current date.
