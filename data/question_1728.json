The MLB announced that the Postseason Wild Card Series would begin Tuesday September 29, 2020.

Amongst other strict precautions, the revised list included that players and staff would be required to wear face coverings at all time, to include the dugout and clubhouse, with the exception of players on the field. This includes all coaches on the field, and every member of the umpiring crew. Also, clubs are required to reduce the size of their traveling parties to essential personnel who are absolutely necessary to playing games (Nightengale, 2020). Depending on the continued health of each club involved in postseason play, I do believe the MLB will crown a 2020 World Series Champion.

This judgment is placed at 98%. While the initial restart of the season was marred by the reality of Covid-19, the league has positively addressed the contaminations and breaches which will allow for the continuation of the season and the championship. The timeline on which the season has operated has been complicated. On July 26, the opening series, Miami was forced to remain in Philadelphia due to Covid-19. The latest case, as of Aug 30, saw the Athletics with one member of their organization testing positive for the coronavirus, forcing the postponement of their game against the Astros. As of the before mentioned date a total of 37 different MLB games, impacting a total of 13 teams, had been postponed due to COVID-19 cases.\u00a0\n\tWhile the number of postponements has been numerous, the majority of play has been unaffected. 472 games have been played successfully this season by the end of August, meaning that 92.73% of games this season have been played to a satisfactory conclusion. Johns Hopkins university depicted the number of new cases at just over 70,000 for the beginning of the season and 50,000 today (October 3rd). Based on current prediction and models, new cases will decline slightly as the year draws to a close. The series begins on the 11th and past trends show that should an individual test positive for the virus the game can be rescheduled with a week following extensive testing.

One thing is clear: The MLB is not intimidated by the virus and they will do everything possible to ensure that season finishes all the way through for the players, the fans, and obviously for the money. I will give the MLB credit: they may be wanting to see it all the way to the end for a monetary gain, but they have also made improvements throughout the season to make sure that the season continues. They have also established a playoff format to where multiple playoff series are played at the same location, similar to what the NBA has done with the Playoff Bubble. This makes sure that the players remained safe and quarantined during their off time, and are protected from any external things that could cause the virus to spread on a team.
