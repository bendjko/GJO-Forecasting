So, giving Yellow House (A) and Heartbeat (D) 15% combined. Adding 5% to the default of 20% to B, C, E for 25% each, with 10% remaining.\n\nIf we use number of GoodReads reviews as a proxy for popularity, B stands out as having 5 times the number of reviews. Adding 5% there. Reviewing the judge composition, there are two judges that are focused on the black experience in America, two women and a gay man.[1] Assuming identity has some role to play in their selection, I think this increases the chances for Solitary and Thick. So, I'm taking 5% from C and adding it to E and adding an additional 5% to B.
