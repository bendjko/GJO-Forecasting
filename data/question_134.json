So, time is of the essence for this limited \"time frame\" of the question. Ordinarily, during summer months, Budenstag business slows considerably in July/August phase, as elsewhere. https://www.bundestag.de/blob/196064/a5d42f1dab06e3c9b0cf6522ebeae9f1/sitz_pdf_15-data.pdf ; \n2. What are the probabilities of such a critical vote being taken w/in the next 90 days ? Politics in BDR move at a glacial pace, usually. NB: attached Spiegel in English pre-vote ( not including AfD gains) article which essentially makes two points: a) governing coalition structure is surely changing for various reasons & b) the process in BDR ordinarily moves at a snails pace http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1081023.html\n3. Post the recent gains made by the AfD ,in great part due to voter dissatisfaction w/ Merkel's immigrant policies, http://bloom.bg/1Ua06CI , Merkel needed from a domestic perspective, a signal for all further discussions, that realistic action is now being take to slow the flow to BDR. \n4. In the interim, the so called EU/Turkish agreement is already being signaled by Eurocrats as a gargantuan effort w/ enormous logistic & tactical obstacles. Euro double speak for, what one might argue in U.S. football terms \"a Hail Mary pass\". \nhttp://on.ft.com/1XAVoMI ; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413\n4. Based on these events and, the \"methodical\" approach taken to German Coalition negotiations, Merkel can w/ reasonable justification \"argue w/\" her Coalition Party members for breathing room. To give her a window of opportunity to see whether the fundamental \"Immigration flow\" issue can be better dealt with. \n5. Instructive on point is : 19/3/16 Interview w/ Horst Seehofer leading CSU party member. I've tried to convert the German to English but, if it doesn't work, google it! Summarizing: He makes clear his party will continue to battle for a top limit of 200K. Is v/ skeptical the present solutions will resolve the fundamental German problem. The the Austrians & Balkan Countries have essentially closed down the flow and, thereby somewhat relieved BDR of its issues, he is thankful. He claimed most other Countries are practicing a type of covert upper limit policy. When questioned about the present flow to BDR that not even his 200K limit seems possible at this stage, he said his initial upper limits was correct from the start and, now BDR must make this practice explicit limit to leave no doubt. And, if that trend holds up, not even his upper 200K will be reached. NB: NEED to fact check this one ! \nhttp://www.bild.de/politik/inland/horst-seehofer/meine-politik-haelt-die-afd-klein-44998378.bild.html\n6. On point 5 Seehofer point about 200K as possibly not being reached should the present moment hold, found the following BBC comment 3/3/16. First two months crossing into Europe was more than 135K. Round this up to 140K for March. Each of us can extrapolate the many counter factual ( what if and if not) variables on the final question so, I have to do more work here &, the other \"will more than 1mn refugees arrive before year end\" as well! \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286\n7. Reference Seehofer interview implying pace has slowed significantly, 20/3/16 reports BDR sees 2016 numbers halved but to prepare for 500K ( this isn't new info as number has been used before as an upper limit) a) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12160474/Germany-to-see-its-number-of-asylum-seekers-halfed-in-2016.html b) \nand, as if end of January over 91K had entered Germany according to Interior Ministry compared to 127K in December http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-refugee-crisis-2016-over-91k-asylum-seekers-arrived-germany-january-2293568 & finally c) a long interview w/ German Interior Minister Maiziere late January where he says clarity on issue has to achieved by spring. Therein, he did note that for January an average of 2000 came per day. Conclusion: numbers all over the place but, the trend is looking lower for time being. Sorry, to have made this so long.

What are the probabilities of such a critical vote being taken w/in the next 90 days ? Politics in BDR move at a glacial pace, usually. NB: attached Spiegel in English pre-vote ( not including AfD gains) article which essentially makes two points: a) governing coalition structure is surely changing for various reasons & b) the process in BDR ordinarily moves at a snails pace http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1081023.html\n3. Post the recent gains made by the AfD ,in great part due to voter dissatisfaction w/ Merkel's immigrant policies, http://bloom.bg/1Ua06CI , Merkel needed from a domestic perspective, a signal for all further discussions, that realistic action is now being take to slow the flow to BDR. \n4. In the interim, the so called EU/Turkish agreement is already being signaled by Eurocrats as a gargantuan effort w/ enormous logistic & tactical obstacles. Euro double speak for, what one might argue in U.S. football terms \"a Hail Mary pass\". \nhttp://on.ft.com/1XAVoMI ; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413\n4. Based on these events and, the \"methodical\" approach taken to German Coalition negotiations, Merkel can w/ reasonable justification \"argue w/\" her Coalition Party members for breathing room. To give her a window of opportunity to see whether the fundamental \"Immigration flow\" issue can be better dealt with. \n5. Instructive on point is : 19/3/16 Interview w/ Horst Seehofer leading CSU party member. I've tried to convert the German to English but, if it doesn't work, google it! Summarizing: He makes clear his party will continue to battle for a top limit of 200K. Is v/ skeptical the present solutions will resolve the fundamental German problem. The the Austrians & Balkan Countries have essentially closed down the flow and, thereby somewhat relieved BDR of its issues, he is thankful. He claimed most other Countries are practicing a type of covert upper limit policy. When questioned about the present flow to BDR that not even his 200K limit seems possible at this stage, he said his initial upper limits was correct from the start and, now BDR must make this practice explicit limit to leave no doubt. And, if that trend holds up, not even his upper 200K will be reached. NB: NEED to fact check this one ! \nhttp://www.bild.de/politik/inland/horst-seehofer/meine-politik-haelt-die-afd-klein-44998378.bild.html\n6. On point 5 Seehofer point about 200K as possibly not being reached should the present moment hold, found the following BBC comment 3/3/16. First two months crossing into Europe was more than 135K. Round this up to 140K for March. Each of us can extrapolate the many counter factual ( what if and if not) variables on the final question so, I have to do more work here &, the other \"will more than 1mn refugees arrive before year end\" as well! \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286\n7.

Conclusion: \nA clear effort to further discourage further  economic migration continues. Merkel has a reasonable approval rating. This is relevant because She will take advantage of this rating which is  still much better than most Heads of State. http://m.dw.com/en/merkels-approval-ratings-improve/a-19083943 These facts, when taken together as whole, makes clear the Germans will not set a limit on the total number of asylum seekers or refugees it will accept through 30/6/16. Here is why. 1. On the one hand, there has not been a noticeable difference from Merkel's 54% German approval rating in early March, http://m.dw.com/en/merkels-approval-ratings-improve/a-19083943.  2. She continues to have a political predisposition and propensity to err on the side of setting a reasonable signal: Europe can and,  will do what it can on the asylum seeker & refugee side. Yet, being the consummate politician that has led to her survival over the years she is indeed capable of making concessions to existing political influences. Here is one.  2. On the other hand, the BRD is considering a 5-year benefit ban for jobless migrants. Germans are considering a ban on EU migrants from unemployment benefits for five years after their arrival as a partial acknowledgement/concession to the AfD recent advance.  http://app.ft.com/cms/s/25bec884-0d52-11e6-9cd4-2be898308be3.html 3. Taking, a more top down/outside view, as mentioned in my attached previous relatively LOW probability forecast two months ago ( NB thread below) the German Q cannot be considered on its own. It must be considered w/in the EU context. The broader view, albeit somewhat more questionable approach, is best exemplified by the Austrian perspective http://app.ft.com/cms/s/a9d48cea-0a27-11e6-b0f1-61f222853ff3.html. Austria's far right Freedom party won both a surprising & powerful first round. It demonstrates a clear message : support for anti immigration policies.\n4.  Moreover, whether the attached ever comes to fruition, it does indeed describe the underlying mentality here in EU land to do everything possible to slow the 2015 Tsunami of refugees as NATO plans a blockade to bar refugees from entering Europe,http://www.salon.com/2016/04/28/after_bombing_libya_into_chaos_nato_plans_blockade_to_bar_refugees_from_europe_with_u_s_help/ in spite of the argument that such a plan violates international law as, was the case, with the EU/Turkey deal.  \n////////\nNB: PREVIOUS reasoning 20/3/16:\nI maintain my 1% for period b/w 13 March through 30th June. Simply wanted to provide justification as follows: 1. Summer is approaching. So, time is of the essence for this limited \"time frame\" of the question. Ordinarily, during summer months, Budenstag business slows considerably in July/August phase, as elsewhere. https://www.bundestag.de/blob/196064/a5d42f1dab06e3c9b0cf6522ebeae9f1/sitz_pdf_15-data.pdf ; \n2. What are the probabilities of such a critical vote being taken w/in the next 90 days ? Politics in BDR move at a glacial pace, usually. NB: attached Spiegel in English pre-vote ( not including AfD gains) article which essentially makes two points: a) governing coalition structure is surely changing for various reasons & b) the process in BDR ordinarily moves at a snails pace http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1081023.html\n3. Post the recent gains made by the AfD ,in great part due to voter dissatisfaction w/ Merkel's immigrant policies,  http://bloom.bg/1Ua06CI , Merkel needed from a domestic perspective, a signal for all further discussions, that realistic action is now being take to slow the flow to BDR. \n4. In the interim, the so called EU/Turkish agreement is already being signaled by Eurocrats as a gargantuan effort w/ enormous logistic & tactical obstacles. Euro double speak for, what one might argue in U.S. football terms \"a Hail Mary pass\". \nhttp://on.ft.com/1XAVoMI ; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413\n4. Based on these events and, the \"methodical\" approach taken to German Coalition negotiations, Merkel can w/ reasonable justification \"argue w/\" her Coalition Party members for breathing room. To give her a window of opportunity to see whether the fundamental \"Immigration flow\" issue can be better dealt with. \n5. Instructive on point is : 19/3/16 Interview w/ Horst Seehofer leading CSU party member. I've tried to convert the German to English but, if it doesn't work, google it! Summarizing: He makes clear his party will continue to battle for a top limit of 200K. Is v/ skeptical the present solutions will resolve the fundamental German problem. The the Austrians & Balkan Countries have essentially closed down the flow and, thereby somewhat relieved BDR of its issues, he is thankful. He claimed most other Countries are practicing a type of covert upper limit policy. When questioned about the present flow to BDR that not even his 200K limit seems possible at this stage, he said his initial upper limits was correct from the start and, now BDR must make this practice explicit limit to leave no doubt. And, if that trend holds up, not even his upper 200K will be reached. NB: NEED to fact check this one ! \nhttp://www.bild.de/politik/inland/horst-seehofer/meine-politik-haelt-die-afd-klein-44998378.bild.html\n6. On point 5 Seehofer point about 200K as possibly not being reached should the present moment hold, found the following BBC comment 3/3/16. First two months crossing into Europe was more than 135K. Round this up to 140K for March. Each of us can extrapolate the many counter factual ( what if and if not) variables on the final question so, I have to do more work here &, the other \"will more than 1mn refugees arrive before year end\" as well! \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286\n7. Reference Seehofer interview implying pace has slowed significantly, 20/3/16 reports BDR sees 2016 numbers halved but to prepare for 500K ( this isn't new info as number has been used before as an upper limit) a) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12160474/Germany-to-see-its-number-of-asylum-seekers-halfed-in-2016.html b) \nand, as if end of January over 91K had entered Germany according to Interior Ministry compared to 127K in December http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-refugee-crisis-2016-over-91k-asylum-seekers-arrived-germany-january-2293568 & finally c) a long interview w/ German Interior Minister Maiziere late January where he says clarity on issue has to achieved by spring. Therein, he did note that for January an average of 2000 came per day.  Conclusion: numbers all over the place but, the trend is looking lower for time being. Sorry, to have made this so long.

It seemed interestingly different than others questions I tackled. As ever we start by asking about a BASE RATE. What would be a base rate here? Arguably all instances of massive migration in Europe happened sufficiently far in the past, and under sufficiently different circumstances, that they would be poor guides now. I was a bit lost, reading random articles about refugees, when I came upon stats [1, chart #5] on the number of asylum requests *as a fraction of the population* in 2015. I had heard that Hungary now outright rejects refugees, and that recently Austria put a cap on its number of refugees. Lo and behold, they are both near the top of the chart: Hungary had 18 asylum applications per 1000 inhabitants, and Austria had 10.2. According to this theory, Sweden, which is second on that chart with 16.7, should have taken action to curb the number of refugees coming in. It hasn't put a cap on the number [2] but it's taken other measures [3]. To test the theory a different way, I tried to see whether the Netherlands (near the bottom of the chart, with 2.7) had announced any refugee-controlling measure, and I couldn't find any news of it. So maybe there's something to the theory that a big determinant of whether a country acts to limit refugee numbers is something like \"number of refugees accepted\"/population, for which [1, chart #5] is a proxy. It also seems logically plausible; I feel I could tell a story about why it should be so. Germany currently sits at 5.9 asylum requests per 1000 inhabitants. Since Germany & Austria are neighbors and similar in many ways, I will assume for a base rate that Germany would do as Austria [4] and announce a cap one month after the number of asylum requests per capita reaches 10.2 / 1000. That means it needs to receive  ((10.2 - 5.9)/1000)*(German pop) = (4.3/1000)*(80 million) = 43*8000 = 344k asylum applications before 1 June 2016. It received 181k in Q1 2016, up from Q1 2015 [5]. If this keeps up for 2 more months, they would hit (181k)*5/3 = 302k on 1 June 2016, about 12% short. In order to get to the target 344k, the rate of requests would have to go up 35% in April-May. I don't see why it should but I'm not very certain, so I assign it a low-ish probability of 10-20%, say 15%. To adjust this, I can think of two questions: (1) could something happen to make Germany cap with more/fewer refugees per capita than Austria? (2) Is there any reason why the announcement might be made in more/less than a month after the critical number is reached? The big obvious thing for (1) is an Islamic terrorist attack. But Germany has essentially no history of Islamic terrorism [6]. On the other side, German culture seems to broadly support this receptiveness, and have features that dampen a reaction against refugees [7]. This is fuzzy but it makes me want to knock off a few %, call it 10% now. On (2), Merkel has made a very big deal of being pro-refugee, and very recently has outright rejected a proposal to cap their number [8]. My guess is she would postpone such a cap as long as she can. Another downgrade, to 5%. Now to read what everyone else has said!

What are the probabilities of such a critical vote being taken w/in the next 90 days ? Politics in BDR move at a glacial pace, usually. NB: attached Spiegel in English pre-vote ( not including AfD gains) article which essentially makes two points: a) governing coalition structure is surely changing for various reasons & b) the process in BDR ordinarily moves at a snails pace http://m.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-1081023.html\n3.  Post the recent gains made by the AfD ,in great part due to voter dissatisfaction w/ Merkel's immigrant policies,  http://bloom.bg/1Ua06CI , Merkel needed from a domestic perspective, a signal for all further discussions, that realistic action is now being take to slow the flow to BDR.\n4. In the interim, the so called EU/Turkish agreement is already being signaled by Eurocrats as a gargantuan effort w/ enormous logistic & tactical obstacles.  Euro double speak for, what one might argue in U.S. football terms \"a Hail Mary pass\". \nhttp://on.ft.com/1XAVoMI ; http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35854413\n4. Based on these events and, the \"methodical\" approach taken to German Coalition negotiations, Merkel can w/ reasonable justification \"argue w/\" her Coalition Party members for breathing room. To give her a window of opportunity to see whether the fundamental \"Immigration flow\" issue can be better dealt with. \n5. Instructive on point is : 19/3/16 Interview w/ Horst Seehofer leading CSU party member. I've tried to convert the German to English but, if it doesn't work, google it! Summarizing: He makes clear his party will continue to battle for a top limit of 200K. Is v/ skeptical the present solutions will resolve the fundamental German problem. The the Austrians & Balkan Countries have essentially closed down the flow and, thereby somewhat relieved BDR of its issues, he is thankful. He claimed most other Countries are practicing a type of covert upper limit policy. When questioned about the present flow to BDR that not even his 200K limit seems possible at this stage, he said his initial upper limits was correct from the start and, now BDR must make this practice explicit limit to leave no doubt. And, if that trend holds up, not even his upper 200K will be reached. NB: NEED to fact check this one ! \nhttp://www.bild.de/politik/inland/horst-seehofer/meine-politik-haelt-die-afd-klein-44998378.bild.html\n6. On point 5 Seehofer point about 200K as possibly not being reached should the present moment hold, found the following BBC comment 3/3/16. First two months crossing into Europe was more than 135K. Round this up to 140K for March. Each of us can extrapolate the many counter factual ( what if and if not) variables on the final question so, I have to do more work here &, the other \"will more than 1mn refugees arrive before year end\" as well! \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286\n7. Reference Seehofer interview implying pace has slowed significantly, 20/3/16 reports BDR sees 2016 numbers halved but to prepare for 500K ( this isn't new info as number has been used before as an upper limit) a) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12160474/Germany-to-see-its-number-of-asylum-seekers-halfed-in-2016.html b) \n and, as if end of January over 91K had entered Germany according to Interior Ministry compared to 127K in December http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-refugee-crisis-2016-over-91k-asylum-seekers-arrived-germany-january-2293568 & finally c) a long interview w/ German Interior Minister Maiziere late January where he says clarity on issue has to achieved by spring. Therein, he did note that for January an average of 2000 came per day.  Conclusion: numbers all over the place but, the trend is looking lower for time being.  Sorry, to have made this so long.

That noted, Coalition politics in Germany a special approach to politics. Suffice it to say it has the German position in the EU, what it is today. Dominant.  Merkel has indeed put at stake a significant amount of  her political capital w/ Germans on the refugee question. And, this is the FIRST clear response. Germans, when given the right to vote on this particular issue,  are signaling less goodwill that Merkel seems prepared to provide publicly. And, it is increasingly likely she loses traction w/ her EU partners ( NB: E. Euro Countries including Austria, Hungary, et cetera) on the so called EU/Turkish \"deal\" which by the day looks more questionable both on legal & fundamental political opposition to political concession  policies from other such \"not in\" Countries. So, for purposes of the time frame of GJO question, three larger issues need to be resolved:\n1) Coalition politics in BRD.\n2)External Support Merkel achieves for her still publicly stated positions on these refugees.\n3) Merkel as an Astute politician. 1) coalition politics in BDR is, suffice it to say, a v nuanced more complex negation process with all relevant parties at the table attempting to find a common ground. The Green Party party here has proven it can actually come from outside the establishment circles and, increase their political status w/in the coalition. Granted, the AfD have come on strong but, during this  negotiation process, they must prove themselves capable of \"my way or the highway\" politics. It will take both time and skill on this front for at first blush appears to be a major victory - to turn this into some degree of political impact within the broader process.  NB: an instructive piece : http://www.faz.net/-gpf-8epnv#GEPC;s5 unfortunately couldn't find an English version here you have it.\n2) Merkel has a big problem w/ her EU partners on the broader issue. The probability of Eastern Euro countries changing course from their present extremely cautious to we've done enough is v high. The upcoming summit on this refugee point after a last minute breakdown due to additional Turkish demands leaves Merkel w/  nearly a \"lose-lose\" dilemma. Whether she can push through an acceptable agenda @ this EU Summit  w/ so many uncertainties being placed on her relatively STILL progressive outlook, I really don't know. Nor, I doubt, does She or anyone else for that matter. Sounds like a v highly probability of a \"face saving deal\" that actually has little substance on the fundamental issue. More to come.\n3) Merkel the astute politician. She is not an \"over confident\" politician. She calculates well. She has proven the pundits time and again wrong. W/ so long a track record of carrying out her agenda. That she truly believes Her course is the proper course for Germany is v clear.

OTOH 1. In the US amending the constitution is almost impossible; in most other democracies I know of, they have a much different approach. In Germany (quoted from wikipedia) \"Amendments[edit]\nProcess[edit]\nArticle 79 states the Basic Law may be amended by an absolute two-thirds majority of the Bundestag along with a simple two-thirds majority of the Bundesrat, excluding amendment of those areas defined by the eternity clause.[15] History[edit]\nThe Basic Law has been amended 50 times as of 2003.[16] Important changes to the Basic Law were the re-introduction of conscription and the establishment of the Bundeswehr in 1956. Therefore, several articles were introduced into the constitution, e.g., Art. 12a, 17, 45a-c, 65a, 87a-c GG. Another important reform were the introduction in 1968 of emergency competences, for example Art. 115 Paragraph 1 GG. This was done by a grand coalition of the two main political parties CDU/CSU and SPD and was accompanied by heated debate. In the following year there were changes to the articles regarding the distribution of taxes between federal government and the states of Germany. During reunification, the two states discussed the possibility of drafting a new common constitution followed by a plebiscite, as envisioned in Art. 146 (1990), but this path was ultimately not taken. Instead the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic decided to keep the Basic Law with only minor changes, because it had proved to be effective in West Germany. To facilitate reunification and to reassure other states, the FRG made some changes to the Basic Law. Article 23 was fulfilled by reunification itself, and then withdrawn to indicate that there were no other parts of Germany that existed outside of the unified territory.[17][18] The question of \u201cusing\u2033 Article 146 to draw a new constitution, and hold a referendum, was left to the twelfth (and first all-German) Bundestag, who after considering the question decided against a new draft. However, the Bundestag passed the constitutional reform of 1994, a minor change, but still fulfilling the constitutional question together with some other amendments between 1990 and 1994. For example, affirmative action was allowed in women's rights, and environmental protection was made a policy objective of the state in the new Article 20a. In 1992, membership in the European Union was institutionalised (Art. 23 GG). For the privatisation of the railways and the postal service, amendments were necessary as well. Since then, there have only been minor amendments, with the exception of the Balanced Budget Amendment added in 2009, which becomes fully effective in 2016. In 2002, protection of animals was explicitly mentioned in Art. 20a GG. The most controversial debate arose concerning the limitation of the right to asylum in 1993 as in the current version of Art. 16 a GG. This change was later challenged and confirmed in a judgment by the constitutional court. Another controversy was spawned by the limitation of the right to the invulnerability of the private domain (Unverletzlichkeit der Wohnung) by means of acoustic observation (Gro\u00dfer Lauschangriff). This was done by changes to Art. 13 Paragraph 3 and Art. 6 GG. The changes were challenged in the constitutional court, but the judges confirmed the changes. Other changes took place regarding a redistribution of competencies between federal government and the L\u00e4nder.\" So my impression is that when something is important enough, there are changes and the process does not need to be lengthy. 2. The other way to significantly limit rights related to asylum are legal shenanigans (esoteric legal term related to redefining, re-interpreting, etc.)."], [601, "2016-02-28T01:35:40Z", [0.02, 0.75, 0.23], ""], [1993, "2016-02-27T23:17:03Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [73, "2016-02-27T23:05:22Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.94], ""], [53, "2016-02-27T23:04:24Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], "ht @Anneinak, @einsteinjs, @Sjens, and @HW15\nRecent German legislation seems likely to take some pressure off for now.

The move came amid increasing national tensions across the continent, with Greece withdrawing its ambassador from Austria and France condemning new border checks introduced by Belgium. In Berlin the Bundestag voted by an overwhelming majority of 429 votes to 147 for a package of restrictive measures, including a simpler deportation policy and limits on the rights of migrants to bring family members to join them. Germany is determined to avoid a repeat of last year\u2019s crisis, when 1.1 million people sought sanctuary within its borders. ~~~~ COMMENT: Based on my reading of the question and the news of what Germany did today, I'm fairly certain that this IFP remains open.

Here's what @Sjens said: I had the opportunity to visit the (first) debate about the \"Asylpaket II\" (asylum package II) in the German Bundestag last Friday. The law will futher restrict options for refugees; e.g. stop family reunification measures among other things. The draft has still to be debated and agreed upon in the committees before it will be debated again in the Bundestag. Together with the NATO-mission and the talks with Turkey, that will be it for now, I think. Christoph Str\u00e4sser (SPD), the German Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid, just resigned two days ago as a protest against the upcoming \"Asylpaket II\". He did a great job. So this is pretty much pushing some boundaries too much already. (That Commissioner-position however is not regarded to be a very influental/important one. Which also explains his frustration.) The \"Asylpaket II\" will get the votes from CDU/CSU & SPD. I don't see a vote of confidence looming right now. If there'll be one, it would be initiated by the right-wing of CDU/CSU. However, there are no coalition partners. The AFD is no member of the Bundestag, so regional elections will not change that, and they would not want to form a coalition anyway. This only leaves the left-winged Green Party and \"Die Linke\" (\"The Left\"). They are opposed to Merkel for exactly the opposite reason: Her recent refugee policy is way too harsh in their view. There is still enough support for Merkel by the MPs of the CDU/CSU & the SPD and she has to keep them together by seeking a policy somewhere around the consensus, avoiding to be perceived as too harsh or too lenient at the same time.

What are the chances of Merkel being ousted or voted out with no confidence before the elections in 2017? Zero! Even her biggest opponent and critic, Seehofer, has to pull in his tail in like a wounded dog when confronted! The German politicians are too afraid of the system to be true opponents and get out-of-line; hence losing their pension. \u00a0 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/horst-seehofer-ueber-angela-merkel-stehen-zur-kanzlerin-a-1077043.html 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Dublin convention was breached in September with the \u201cwir schaffen das\u201d motto.

Much more than 6 months. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Merkel is the living embodiment of Thatcher, who refused to listen to the people, her party or anyone else for that matter until the 1990 elections forced her out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1990 Merkel is on just as much of an ego-trip as Thatcher was and she will concede nothing until forcefully booted out. BTW: Merkel has been in power longer than Thatcher now. 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which brings us to her politics, her vision of \u201cwir schaffen das\u201d. Her pan is simple, let Turkey and Greece deal with the problem and pay them some money to do it. It is not as if the Grexit issue would have taught her anything about the inefficiencies and corrupt nature of the Aegis region, no, we must be patient. Just for sake of saving face, she will not \u201cclose the borders\u201d but look for other solutions\u2026outside of Germany and especially on the EU front. 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Final word, holding back the Aleppo refugees is already Turkey\u2019s policy in action. Probably an indirect deal that Germany and Turkey made on her last visit, in addition to the Nato ships\u2026 http://sputniknews.com/europe/20160211/1034581460/merkel-erdogan-nato-aegean-patrol.html So, the answer to the question is sadly 100% open door policy until the September 2017 elections.\u00a0 The only element of the GJOpen question that stirs away from 100% is the word \u201cannounce\u201d.

For now I think one of the most relevant factors is the timing of the local, state and national elections.  According to this site: http://www.wahlrecht.de/termine.htm the next national elections do not occur until Fall of 2017.  There are local elections and state elections in the meantime but I am unclear how much influence they will have on national politics.  Clearly I am assuming that Merkel's position is central to any actual change.  I need to investigate her relationship to her party and her coalition  partners in order to better predict what may move her.  In general she is someone who is careful and empirical in her judgements.  She also brings to this issue several kinds of legitimacy which matter in a German leader:  she has a PhD in physics, she was born in the West but raised in the East after her father who was a Lutheran pastor accepted a position in the DDR.  These biographical details matter, I think, because she has both an ethical and empirical manner in her approach to politics which I think is strongly influencing her approach to the matter of refugees and asylum seekers.  Her decision to radically welcome Syrians and others surprised me given how unyielding she had been in the negotiations with the Greeks.  I suspect she may now wish she had been more reserved in her judgement but nonetheless, I expect that she will expend considerable social and political capital to avoid utterly retracting her position.  While there are factors that could push her and her partners to make some changes in the next six months (I need to do a great deal more reading on this before I can calculate probable behavior) the counterweight will be the relationship Germany has with Turkey, concerns about the rising number of casualties in the Syrian war and international attention which is not flagging.  I'm also relatively certain that she will not respond to pressure from the far right.  Indeed the more the far right protests, especially in places that were once the DDR, the more I would expect her to resist calls to limit the total number of refugees Germany will accept.  I do expect that there will be more changes about the types of refugees or the locations from whence they may come but that has already happened.  I look forward to reading comments from others on this topic.
