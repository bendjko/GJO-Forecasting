Bitcoin, despite its own issues and volatility, is historically the more stable of the cryptos let alone the most valuable.

Between May and now it has seen a great deal of growth despite its own volatility. In mid May, it climbed from its 10cent initial value to $2.30 per share.

As the option with the highest brand recognition, Bitcoin is also most likely to benefit from new entries to the market (The opposite could be argued-- that this makes Bitcoin the biggest target to serve as an example to its smaller competitors, but this likely wouldn't happen by the end of November). So Bitcoin seems set to be at the top of the pack. I next compared 6 month performance of all 4 currencies, since that is the time period examined by CoinDesk closest to our dates. XRP is disqualified due to its -2% 6 months performance. It would take a miracle to catch up with the others. Bitcoin went down over the last 6 months, but is doing well again the past month. Ethereum and Cardano each do really well at 66% and 84% 6 month increases, respectively. However, Cardano has declined in the last month, weakening it more in our time period. Yet the longer term trend is on Cardano's side, with over a 2000%\u00a0 increase over the past year compared to Ethereum's 850%.\u00a0 Thus, although Cardano has settled down a bit, it should still have the largest change from May to November, since it has been increasing again toward its pre-drop rate from a month ago.

Longevity and individual currency stability are also important; however, immediate endorsement for projection will go, in this case, to the highest performing crypto within the past 12 months.  Within the past 12 months all 4 crypto have experienced fluctuation with Bitcoin and XRP with the more extreme fluctuations and Cardano and Ethereum perfoming more stably.  Cardano has increased more than the other three in terms of current value % gained in the previous 12 months and is receiving moderate endorsement from its broadening initiatives, most specifically academic partnerships.  The Cardano affiliated blockchain research lab iniitiatives in Wyoming are creating Cardano based/educated blockchain crypto professionals in their infancy and helping to establish a crypto-centric hub in the state of Wyoming which has also loosened regulations to assist blockchain and cryptocurrency developers work in the state and attract affiliated talent.  For these reasons I believe it will perform the best with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP to follow as Ethereum has considerable room to grow while allowing incredible margins for investors as Bitcoin has demonstrated long-term growth potential it has become more difficult to increase with the same marginal gains while still performing well.

Rather than trying to predict price movements over the next two months, I will address a simpler question \u2013 do I believe it is likely that the current relative performances of the currencies in question will be disrupted over the next two months. In order to do so I look at two factors \u2013 what is the current standings in performance relative to the baseline in the question, and what information do I have that would allow me to factor in the likelihood of changes that would propel or depress one cryptocurrency versus another (as opposed to broad movements in the crypto market which would be shared across currencies). I assembled a table which shows the current gains associated with each and calculated a relative proportion of total gain across all four currencies. This is a starting point. Then I wanted to add in a factor regarding sensitivity to change \u2013 for this I used the standard deviations available on the coindesk quotes pages referenced in the question. I multiplied the gains by the standard deviations which had the effect of deweighting more stable currencies and increasing the potential of those which have demonstrated the potential for larger movements. The impact is slight and I haven\u2019t developed much of a methodology for determining appropriate weighting, so the results are naturally weighted. This does lead to a swap in primary choice \u2013 Bitcoin currently leads with 34% of gains, however Cardano (with 32% of gains) has higher volatility and thus potential to overtake Bitcoin.

As a result, if Bitcoin makes another leg down, ETH, ADA, and XRP are likely to move down harder. The same applies to the opposite direction. With this in mind, my forecast is going to based on where I believe Bitcoin moves within the next ~6 months, and consequently the entire crypto market. Since Bitcoin's inception, its price has tended to follow a 4-year cycle containing a 1-year bull market resulting in a blow-off top followed by 3-year bear market. This 4-year halving cycle appears to be centered around the Bitcoin mining reward \"halving events\", which creates a supply shock and kicks-off the bull market. With this foundation, we can look towards historical patterns in the metrics derived from the blockchain. Looking at the on-chain metrics at the time Bitcoin topped in 2013 and 2017, we can see that the metrics looked very similar. When this is compared to the on-chain metrics at this most recent \"top\", the picture looks completely different and the metrics point towards Bitcoin being half-way through its current bull market. Based on the number of days after last Bitcoin halving event and these on-chain metrics, I slightly lean towards that the Bitcoin is still half way through its bull market. With this in mind, I forecast there being a 70% chance that the crypto market moves higher from here and a 30% chance it moves lower. In the case that the crypto market moves higher, as mentioned before \"alt-coins\" make higher % magnitude moves in comparison to Bitcoin. Based on ETH and ADA's large future potential and multitude of use-cases, these are likely to outperform XRP. Ripple likely has a rough future ahead of it due to its lack of use-case and uphill regulatory battles, most notably with the SEC. However, due to XRP having a lower market cap than ETH and ADA, and the tendency of lower market cap coins' ability to move with higher % magnitude, XRP has a non-zero chance to outperform ETH and ADA. I estimate this being a 1/7 chance. In terms of ETH vs ADA, both of these projects have bright futures and events ahead, and it is difficult for me to distinguish which will outperform the other. In the case that the crypto market moves lower, Bitcoin should hold up the best relative to the other coins. This is what has happened historically but I would also like to refer to the \"Bitcoin dominance\" chart (Bitcoin dominance refers what % of the total crypto market cap is Bitcoin). Looking at the 2017 bull-market, Bitcoin dominance had a tough time dropping below the 35-40% area. As of today, Bitcoin dominance appears to be bouncing off of this 40% area, which indicates we may see more Bitcoin strength in the short-term (2-4 months). If the market were to crash, this would support the idea that Bitcoin will hold up the strongest relative to ETH, ADA, and XRP."], [88452, "2021-06-10T11:00:29Z", [0.62, 0.38, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [101281, "2021-06-10T03:59:05Z", [0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1], "Based on online projections, it seems like Etherium and Bitcoin are the most stable.

The first question is very dependent on many external factors, such as whether inflation rates will rise, institutional investors will become market participants as a way to hedge against their traditional investments, or whether there could be another crypto crash just like how there was one in 2018. This is hard to predict and I would say that it is 50-50. The second question is important to consider as these cryptocurrencies have different volatility profiles and can behave differently whether the market is up or down. In the case that the entire crypto market is up, the crypto with the highest \"beta\" (relative to BTC) should theoretically go up the most and perform the best. In the other hand, if the crypto market goes down, then the reverse should happen and the least volatile cryptocurrency should perform the best. Typically, the larger the market cap of a cryptocurrency, the less subject it is to volatile swings. The ordering by market cap for the listed coins are BTC, ETH, ADA, and XRP, with a respective market cap of (612B, 282B, 47B, 38B) at the time of writing. Based on these observations, it would seem as if either BTC or XRP would perform the best (BTC in a bear market as it would see the least in declines, conversely XRP in a bull market as it would see the most in gains) The final question to consider is whether or not there will be event-driven price fluctuations during the time period. One of the biggest changes will be happening to the Ethereum blockchain in the form of the London Hard Fork, as ETH developers are planning to switch to ETH 2.0.
