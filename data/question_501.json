That Zuma will leave office is clear.  However, a more important question is when and not whether.  After the record NEC meeting (~15 hours), Ramaphosa returned to Zuma to convey the decision that he needs to resign (again).  Zuma steadfastly refuses.  Given the following issues, the crises is still ripe for conflict.  Zuma is supported by at least close to half, and the largest number of ANC members in the organization.  This has a likelihood of the following:  Zuma leaving when chooses, creating his own party (as stated repeatedly), and the ANC will split down its center at all levels, including its highest political structures.   This creates a serious dilemma for Ramaphosa;  he will govern with a weak power base with strong collective opposition in an unofficial coalition between Zuma and center left parties in parliament.  More urgently, we can expect a significant increase in the levels of violence in the country in the short term accompanied by assassinations on a level not previously seen, capital flight, depreciation of the Rand and unstable investment potentials in the near and long term.  Chaos on the parliamentary front can be expected, a possibility of an entire cabinet resigning under the scenarios of a no confidence vote or impeachment proceedings and or legal maneuvers.  The legal dilemma the organization faces is the following:  Zuma remains the president of the country, distinct from or despite his role in the party and the insistence by the NWC/NEC demands.  Ramaphosa, as head of the party is in no legal or constitutional position to force removal or resignation, despite organizational recall.  Zuma may constitutionally remove Ramaphosa as Vice President despite his position as head of the party.   There are many uncertainties given incomplete private information held by members within the higher political structures of the parties and by Zuma himself.  There is no doubt that one possibility is that Zuma could coerce, by using private information obtained during his tenure as head of the security and intelligence apparatus of the party prior to the negotiated settlement; ethnic affiliation is a weapon with strong potential leading to recursive indecisiveness until his term ends or parliament succeeds in its no confidence vote, or largely out of the timeframe of this IFP but not the end of his term - impeachment.  One aspect that analysts are certain of is the unleashing of real revolutionary dynamics that include unanticipated levels of violence, strife and long term instability; conditions for financial collapse of the economy remains much like it did prior to Davos.  Debt as % of GDP is slightly above 51%, interest payments of international debt has placed significant pressure on an economy that is projected to have a growth rate of 1% or less for 2018.  Domestic state owned enterprises and the ability of the government to bail them out is increasingly less possible every single day that passes.  Dependence on imports are significantly higher than its export potential with a balance of accounts remaining in the red for well over a decade or more.   Exporting raw materials with an importation of finished products for domestic use, despite the increase in global commodity prices for raw materials, strengthens its approach to large deficit spending budgets.  Growth by import substitution places countries within a domain of dependency from which they are unable to escape.  Inequality measured by the Gini coefficient remains the highest in the world, deprivation is deep with government service levels to its citizens at an appalling low rate;  real unemployment at 35% with the official rate noted at about 24% (approximately), hunger and desperation providing  conditions ripe for revolutionary pathways in political and economic development. This all indicates a stark dynamic and a deep crises.  One hopes that despite it all,  deprivation, inequality, and suffering under these economic conditions along with the constitutional crises, brings nothing but a significant improvement in ordinary people\u2019s lives and a cessation of such suffering within the country."], [1993, "2018-02-13T03:25:51Z", [1.0], ""], [45812, "2018-02-13T02:54:34Z", [0.8], ""], [45812, "2018-02-13T02:54:02Z", [0.65], ""], [19801, "2018-02-13T02:29:51Z", [1.0], "South Africa's ANC decides to remove Zuma as head of state: source\nhttps://www.reuters.com/news/world"], [37379, "2018-02-13T01:30:58Z", [0.99], "Thank you, @JS for http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/692132 See also Dateline 2-12-2018 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-13/jacob-zuma-given-48-hours-to-quit-as-south-africa-president/9425668"], [172, "2018-02-13T01:19:20Z", [1.0], "Good riddance to the half-witted kleptocrat.

Her Youth League was no match for them. Zuma is not the least bit isolated. He has powerful patronage networks. SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and other state institutions have been repurposed to serve them. A significant chunk of the ANC has either economic interests or ideological interests, or both, that align with Zuma and his networks. Plus, the Zulu love him. The public embarrassment of Zuma and loss of faith in government institutions have caused a fracture in the ANC. The ANC will do whatever it takes to preserve itself. This probably means compromise. Zuma will not leave office without concessions. Ramaphosa and his supporters may be forced to accept the preservation of much of the shadow state that Zuma helped build.

Looks like Ramaphosa's gamble has worked, and Zuma has (reluctantly) ceded some ground. The specifics remain to be finalized, though. In case Zuma changes his mind, Ramaphosa also has the scheduled Feb 22 vote of confidence in his pocket, but I think he'd rather not use it as it may divide the ANC.

This was mere speculation, newly elected ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule told reporters . . . responding to a Friday report by the Mail & Guardian newspaper that Zuma has provided key members of the ANC with a list of requirements if he were to step down as president of South Africa.  The report said Zuma is adamant that after he steps down, Dlamini-Zuma, ex-wife of Zuma and now an ANC MP, takes over as the country\u2019s interim president until the 2019 general elections. Zuma also wants key members within his cabinet to stay in power and become part of the next government, to be led by newly elected ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, according to the report.  This is rumor and will not be entertained by the ANC, Magashule said.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/opinion/how-exactly-will-our-president-depart-from-office-apart-from-reluctantly-12743497 \" . . . what are the mechanisms that could apply or be of influence in relation to his removal from office? . . .  As far as a resignation is concerned, this could flow from the recall of Zuma by the national executive committee (NEC) of the ANC, as occurred with former president Thabo Mbeki. This option is problematic because Zuma is very different from Mbeki, and the NEC may not be able to reach a unanimous decision on the question of recall. Furthermore, so-called recall is not legally binding, and Zuma will resist. Should this be the case, it is necessary to examine the constitution in relation to the removal of the president. Section 89 provides for the removal of the president by impeachment, while section 102(2) deals with motions of no confidence, which if successful require the president to resign. This vote of no confidence can on request be by a secret ballot, as was ruled by the Constitutional Court in an important judgment last year.  It is submitted that if Zuma refuses to resign before Parliament reassembles next month, it is very likely that section 102(2) will be put into operation and will be precipitated by either opposition parties or indeed the governing party or members of it. In an important case, the Constitutional Court held on December 29 that the National Assembly had failed in its constitutional obligation to hold Zuma accountable, and to be able to proceed with his impeachment following the release of the Nkandla report and the Nkandla judgment of the Constitutional Court. In an important majority judgment by Justice Chris Jafta, the Constitutional Court considered the serious consequences and implications of the impeachment proceedings provided for in section 89 of the constitution, which authorise the National Assembly exclusively, by a vote of two-thirds of its members, to remove the president from office.  A constitutional prerequisite for such a drastic process of impeachment is as stipulated in section 89(1) a factual inquiry into whether one of a triple of listed grounds is present, as set out above. What the court found was that there were actually no rules in place to address what was required by the process that is set out in section 89, and furthermore that the National Assembly was obligated by the constitution, as the supreme law of the land, to do so.  As a result, the court ordered the National Assembly to make appropriate rules regulating the procedure required by section 89(1) within 120 days from the date of its order. All things considered, from the point of view of realpolitik, it is submitted that the National Assembly is unlikely to begin impeachment proceeding against Zuma, but is more likely to institute a no- confidence motion in terms of section 102(2) as explained above. It is significant to note there are two consequences of a successful motion of no confidence. First, as is the position with a successful impeachment, the president retains all his considerable rights and benefits as an erstwhile president.  Secondly, impeachment requires two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly to support a vote in this regard. It appears that the impeachment option is very unlikely. In relation to a motion of no confidence, it is submitted that there is the real possibility that Zuma will pre-empt this and resign if it appears that such a motion would be successful.  Considerable political negotiation is likely to precede this and has apparently already started, and Zuma will obviously endeavour to obtain the most favourable terms in relation to his position and people closely associated with him, as well as some of his very controversial political and financial activities after retirement.  The ANC would try to ensure as best it can to adroitly manage the departure of Zuma in a manner that preserves the unity of the party. Should he resign, there will be a vacancy in the office of the presidency, and then section 86(3) will become operative. This requires the election of a new president within 30 days. * Devenish is emeritus professor at UKZN and one of the scholars who assisted in drafting the interim constitution in 1993.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://businesstech.co.za/news/finance/219601/rand-hits-key-strength-level-as-zuma-exit-talk-heats-up/ \" . . .  new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa . . .  is saying that Zuma's future would be decided \"as time goes on\".\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://ewn.co.za/2018/01/16/opinion-ramaphosa-should-end-presidential-merry-go-round-in-south-africa Zuma\u2019s supporters are strongly supportive of the idea of an interim president. It has its roots in the previous succession drama that unfolded after the ANC forced Thabo Mbeki to resign as the country\u2019s president in September 2008. Kgalema Motlanthe, the ANC\u2019s then deputy president, stepped up to the plate to serve in his place until the party president \u2013 Zuma \u2013 assumed office following the general election in May 2009. It has never been revealed why Zuma did not become state president directly, although it\u2019s clear that they intended Motlanthe was to become a cypher, subject to Zuma\u2019s control. This precedent is now being bandied about as established practice that has to be followed. But there\u2019s no getting around the fact that it\u2019s being pursued by Zuma and his supporters for dubious reasons. In short, they want to put the brakes on the transition to a Ramaphosa presidency so that they can protect and further their personal interests. Zuma, in particular, wants to place continuing political obstacles in the way of his being subject to prosecution through the courts on 783 criminal charges. The charges go back to before he assumed office. And there are lingering hopes among his closest acolytes that they can push through a deal with the Russians on nuclear power before their rule ends. Fortunately, reports indicate that Ramaphosa has rejected the idea of standing aside in favour of an interim president (and certainly, of Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who has been proposed by the Zuma faction).  . . .  Zuma has every right to remain in office until his term expires. Constitutionally, he does. But politically he is ever more a lame duck, rapidly leaking support in the wake of Ramaphosa\u2019s election to the party leadership. This is why there is an increasingly determined effort to oust him. Zuma\u2019s detractors inside and outside the party argue, correctly, that the more he hangs around the more damage he will be doing to the ANC and its prospects in any forthcoming election. . . . it would demonstrate that South Africa is no shithole democracy.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Comparison class:  I found it very interesting how important it was to Zimbabweans that Mugabe's departure not be called a \"coup\"; it was important to them that Zimbabwe be perceived as an advanced democracy which values the rule of law.

The NEC recalled former president Thabo Mbeki about nine months after Zuma had displaced him as party president. But there is an acute urgency around Zuma\u2019s recall due to the proximity of the 2019 national election and his scandal-ridden decade in office. It is understood that both camps that contested for the ANC presidency would have moved to cut short Zuma\u2019s term in a bid to restore confidence in the party ahead of the 2019 poll. The new NEC is expected to be a \"mixed bag\", which includes remnants of the Zuma faction. However, insiders said due to the shift in the presidency, many of those who were afraid to speak out against Zuma while he was party president might now be emboldened to do so. At a commission sitting during the last two days of the conference, delegates raised Zuma\u2019s recall, but it is understood the debate was shut down by provinces such as KwaZulu-Natal. The issue of \"two centres of power\" was then raised in the plenary session of the conference. The official word from the party was that the NEC was mandated to \"manage\" the issue of \"two centres of power\".  This refers to a power base in Luthuli House \u2014 which is now Ramaphosa \u2014 and another in the state, which is currently Zuma. Outgoing ANC head of organising Fikile Mbalula . . .  emphasised, however, that delegates at the conference had reaffirmed the ANC as the centre of power \u2014 implying that Zuma would have to abide by any decision taken by the party.  \"The ANC takes decisions and its deployees in government must abide \u2026 it is the ANC that gives a mandate to its deployees in government,\" Mbalula said.  One such decision was for a judicial commission of inquiry \u2014 in line with former public protector Thuli Madonsela\u2019s report \u2014 to be set up urgently. This was the key decision taken by the conference that places Zuma in a corner \u2014 he has also been ordered by the high court to set up the commission with a presiding judge selected by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. . . .  The ANC has done nothing but ignore most findings of the integrity commission, especially those relating to Zuma.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Zuma is despised and is a blackmark on the face of ANC.

Conclusions I drew from Mugabe/Zimbabwe:\n-In a corrupt government, loyalty is not to a person, a party, an ideal, a platform,  a tribe/klan, the nation, or the common good; it is to personal profit/benefit, only, that's why Mugabe lost power almost overnight.\n-Those in power seek to maintain the status quo.\n-Greed for power can be limitless.\n-In a country with a very dominant major party, the greatest challenges to leadership will come from within the party\n-Elections can be de-stabilizing.  They open the door to change and legitimize dissent that otherwise could be more easily labeled treasonous.   Applying those conclusions to Zuma/SA:\n-Zuma's supporters will stay with him until a surer guaranteer of their continued power appears, then they will abandon him over-night.\n-Zuma has hoped that his ex-wife would get the endorsement of the party, but that now appears unlikely.  If she had received strong party support, he may have resigned in her favor so that she could run as an incumbent (having already distributed some of the spoils of power to her cronies to insure her election.)\n-It appears that the insiders favor Ramaphosa:  that makes him the \"Mnangagwa\" of SA.\n-Zuma has had to face 8 votes of no-confidence.  He has survived each with a smaller margin.  I think that once the party has selected his successor, there will be another vote of no-confidence, and Zuma will not survive it because a \"Plan B\" (replacing him with the party nominee) will be welcomed by the public and supported by the party  leaders. Now that I've written my little fairytale-narrative, I have to ask myself:  how realistic is this?  Where does a POM (power player-objectives-means) analysis take me? -The power players are the public, the ANC leadership, and Zuma's inner circle.  \n-The objective of the people is better government, but the ANC leadership & Zuma's inner circle want to maintain their power.\n-The ANC party convention enables the public to express its choice/hope for better government and the ANC leadership & Zuma's inner circle to guide the party to select a candidate which will guarantee their continued power and security.\n-A vote of no-confidence would enable a lawful transition from Zuma to the ANC's presidential candidate. Now, about inside/outside perspectives.\nInside:  I think I've laid out a plausible path to a change in SA leadership prior to the election\nOutside:  that's what I've not figured out yet.  I agree with @ErikFritzsche: Removal becomes more likely the closer the 2019 elections become, the less favorable the electoral prospects for the ANC get, and the more clearly an alternative to Zuma emerges.   I think the probability after 2017 increases slightly non-linear: so I guess, the probability for ceasing to be president before the elections in 2019 (probably in May) and handing over to so  "], [368, "2017-12-06T20:42:10Z", [0.0], ""], [41523, "2017-12-05T23:06:42Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-12-05T19:10:19Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-12-05T01:34:04Z", [0.13], ""], [19801, "2017-12-04T22:15:12Z", [1.0], "1.2017 motion of no confidence On 7 August 2017, Speaker Baleka Mbete announced that she would permit a motion of no confidence in Zuma's government to proceed in the National Assembly via secret ballot.

Zuma has indicated he wants to be replaced by former African Union Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, his ex-wife and the mother of four of his children, rather than her rival, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. \u201cThose who really want to challenge him will have to up their game,\u201d Mathekga said by phone on Monday. \u201cIf he wins the psychological war, which he is winning currently, he is much more likely to win the substantive war of getting his preferred candidate to succeed him.\u201d \"Scandals have shadowed Zuma, 75, during his eight-year presidency, including a finding by the nation\u2019s top court that he broke his oath of office by refusing to repay taxpayer funds spent on his private home. The nation\u2019s graft ombudsman accused him of allowing members of the Gupta family, who are in business with his son, to influence cabinet appointments and the award of state contracts. Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing. \"While Zuma has escaped censure because he\u2019s retained the backing of most of the ANC\u2019s top officials who rely on him for their jobs in the government and cabinet, his leadership has opened up deep divisions within the 105-year-old party and eroded its support. The ANC lost control of Pretoria, the capital, and Johannesburg, the economic hub, in municipal elections in August last year. \"The economy has also suffered, with the nation falling into a recession this year, unemployment at a 14-year high and business confidence close to a three-decade low.\n. . . \n\u201cThe ANC is a house divided,\u201d said Ivor Sarakinsky, a lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand\u2019s School of Governance in Johannesburg. \u201cThat division is going to play itself out in the canvassing of support and the play for control of branches and regions in the buildup to the December electoral conference.\u201d \"Nominations for the ANC\u2019s leadership contest formally open next month, and the candidate who gets the top post will also be its presidential nominee in 2019. \"Dlamini-Zuma, 68, has echoed Zuma\u2019s calls for \u201cradical economic transformation\u201d to address racially based income disparities that date back to apartheid rule, while Ramaphosa, 64, has emphasized the need to stamp out corruption and foster inclusive economic growth. Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete, Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and former ANC treasurer-general Mathews Phosa have also said they intend running for the ruling party leadership. \"While Zuma and his allies will probably prevail in December, the rebels could use the party\u2019s disciplinary procedures to air their critique of the president, according to Darius Jonker, an analyst at Eurasia Group. \u201cThey will now force a debate within the party during their own disciplinary processes on Zuma and his role in these numerous allegations of wrongdoing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is likely to divide the party even further.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If 11 people had voted differently, Zuma would not have survived the last vote of no confidence.

She, naturally, will continue to nurture the vines of the Zuma family tree, including offering her former husband amnesty for his misdeeds \u2026 and probably erecting statues of him and naming roads after him. Like any feudal overlord, Zuma realises that intrigue and muscle are the ways to secure your crown. And the courtiers around him differ only in the amount of fawning and boot-licking they are prepared to do. So, the serfs of the populace and the courtiers of the ANC are going to enable Zuma to become emperor and, even after his wife takes over, he will still be the power behind the throne.

But persistent allegations of corruption, nepotism and abuse of power may finally be catching up with him . . .  \"The showdown is especially dangerous for Zuma because it follows a court ruling in June allowing the speaker of the national assembly, Baleka Mbete, to hold a secret ballot. Mbete, a Zuma ally who survived an attempt in 2014 to sack her for alleged bias, has yet to indicate whether she will do so. But if the vote is held \u201cin camera\u201d, at least 20 ANC MPs critical of Zuma\u2019s leadership are expected to back the motion. \"The ANC holds 249 of the parliament\u2019s 400 seats. The opposition, principally composed of the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema\u2019s Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), will need 50 ANC defectors for a majority. A revolt on such a scale would once have been thought inconceivable in a party whose post-apartheid watchword is unity. But extra-parliamentary pressure for change is intense and growing. \"Major street demonstrations are planned in Cape Town this week. A petition signed by more than a million people demanding Zuma\u2019s removal has been presented to Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president, by the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane.\n. . . \n\". . . Regardless of what happens in parliament, the ANC is due to meet in December to select an heir. Ramaphosa is one candidate. Other possibles are Lindiwe Sisulu, Jeff Radebe, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Zweli Mkhize, Mathews Phosa \u2013 and speaker Mbete. The extent of the line-up indicates how divided the ANC has become.\n. . . \n\" . . .  ANC members . . . . will choose Zuma\u2019s successor in December (or sooner) \"The opposition also includes high-profile individuals with no stated interest in the presidential succession, such as Pravin Gordhan, the former finance minister sacked by Zuma in March. Gordhan warned recently that state capture was crippling the country\u2019s economy. If South Africans allowed the rot to continue, he said, \u201cwe are going to slump into a 10-year disaster\u201d. \"Much of the controversy over state capture centres on the relationship between Zuma and the wealthy Gupta business family, and alleged bribes and kickbacks associated with government contracts. . . . Controversy has also arisen over social media work undertaken by the British PR firm Bell Pottinger to defend Gupta businesses against the allegations. CEO James Henderson has admitted his company\u2019s approach had been naive, but denied any intention to fuel racial tensions through use of terms such as \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d and \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d (which Zuma has claimed lay behind calls for his resignation). \"State capture has become a metaphor for the wider political and economic ills afflicting South African society. In a damning independent report last May, entitled Betrayal of the Promise: How South Africa Is Being Stolen, researchers from the universities of Cape Town, Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and Stellenbosch, funded by George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, accused \u201cZuma Inc\u201d of turning the country into a mafia-style fiefdom. \"It stated: \u201cCommentators, opposition groups and ordinary South Africans underestimate Jacob Zuma, not simply because he is more brazen, wily and brutal than they expect but because they reduce him to caricature.\u201d In reality, the report said, Zuma had presided over a concerted political project to repurpose state institutions to channel money to his cronies in a shadowy elite.\n. . . \n\"The no-confidence motion comes against a backdrop of increased disillusionment with the ANC, as evidenced by last year\u2019s local elections, when the DA and EFF made significant gains. While Zuma\u2019s unpopularity is undoubtedly to blame, so too is South Africa\u2019s worsening economic performance.  Comparing South Africa with other emerging countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s 2017 survey makes alarming reading. Growth has declined sharply since 2011, it said, partly because of electricity shortages, falling commodity prices and policy uncertainty. Unemployment is up, at 27%, while youth unemployment was 53% in 2016.  Low-quality education, high crime rates, healthcare deficiencies and violence against women are cited as continuing problems. A third of South Africans live on or below the poverty line, the survey found. And more than a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid, inequality remains stark, with the top fifth of the population earning 40 times more than the lowest.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If the vote is secret, there's some chance Zuma will lose, but otherwise, I think he'll survive for now.  However, I don't think he'll survive December.\n"], [23234, "2017-08-06T01:24:41Z", [0.42], "SACP's 17 votes appear to be with Zuma in the no confidence motion despite the SACP's continuing calls for Zuma to resign voluntarily. I think this means the ANC would need 67 votes to defect in order for no confidence to occur, which seems like a high number (more than 25% of the ANC), though I suppose it is possible. Zuma could still cease to be president of SA for a reason other than this no-confidence vote.\n[edit Aug. 6]: I think Mbete will try to move forward with an open ballot and litigation will ensue over whether she made her decision on a rational and proper basis or whatever.  I think she probably has incentives to do an open ballot for the following reasons. Seems unlikely that she can be confident that she has enough anti-zuma votes to get rid of Zuma using a secret ballot (needs at least 67 or so from within the ANC?) and she (I think?) has no way to know who betrayed her if she doesn't get the votes to oust Zuma in a secret ballot. Moreover, she appears to need Zuma's support to be president, so it's unclear what her plan would be for the presidency if she succeeded in getting rid of him.  Although people have written that the decision gives her powerful leverage over Zuma, it's unclear to me that she can credibly threaten him with the secret ballot.

Odds are certainly 2 to 4 percent for the next year (see for the US: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html; cf. http://flowingdata.com/projects/2015/life/).\n* Vote of no confidence by parliament: party has majority (249 out of 400 seats), Zuma won previous votes of no confidence (party discipline in South Africa seems to be strict, according to expert judgment: http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/De-Vos-Party-2015.pdf; https://www.jstor.org/stable/723341?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). But might be possible if he loses the backing of ANC (see below). Will see in August\u2026\n* Impeachment: Did not happen, so far. There is no discussion about it, so far. Would be disastrous for ANC\u2026 better would be to remove him.\n* Disastrous re-election prospects for 2019: President is elected by parliament; so it comes down to ANC electoral prospects. Zuma cannot run for the presidential office since there is a term limit of two consecutive terms. ANC won the regional election by 54 percent of the vote share (this was after the first corruption charges were raised); so there is a downward momentum (additionally to a large number of ANC voters that did not vote at all) that could do harm to the hegemonic status of ANC in the South African party system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_municipal_elections,_2016). This is underscored by polls for 2019 (http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-faces-real-prospect-of-losing-2019-poll-8752385), approval ratings (http://www.enca.com/south-africa/polls-south-africans-disappointed-by-political-leadership), and the demonstrations.  Additionally, there is a big issue which fuels the dissatisfaction of the citizens (next to the corruption issue): the national debt and the junk status of the national bonds - all of which is connected with sacking the former finance minister Pravin Gordhan (https://www.ipsos.com/en-za/south-african-youth-concerned-about-effects-downgrade-status; see the prequel of this story, here: https://www.cfr.org/blog/south-africas-president-zuma-trouble-his-party).  \n* And alternatives that emerge in ANC to Zuma: There is some dissatisfaction with Zuma. There is the pressure to present somebody other than Zuma (due to the presidential term limit). Generally, there are competent and even charismatic options, such as Pravin Gordhan or Gwede Mantashe, but they need a power base at the ANC that suffices to get the majority of the party behind themselves. What will happen if he ceases to be president?\n* Acting president if he is unable to act as president (but not stepping down).\n* Deputy president and others\u2026 \n* \u2026until the National Assembly votes for a new president. Reference class: How do other heads of state perform which were in a similar situation? \nUsually, I think, they should be very likely to step down. But South Africa is not Europe or a well-established democracy in the Americas or Asia. Besides this, we have just witnessed the considerable persistence of South Korean president Park Geun-hye. There is. however. the important difference to other presidents that Zuma can be removed from office by the parliament's vote of no confidence, effectively by the ANC.  Forecasting:\n* The removal becomes more likely the closer the 2019 elections come, the less favorable the electoral prospects for the ANC get and the more clearly an alternative to Zuma emerges\u2026\n* Prediction markets present odds for Zuma's ceasing to be president until the end of 2017 of 14 percent. I think, this is a little underrated and would take a bet up to 1:4, i.e. 20 percent.\n* I think the probability after 2017 increases slightly non-linear: so I guess, the probability for ceasing to be president before the elections in 2019 (probably in May) and handing over to someone who can gain voting support with an advantage of incumbency is at least 50 percent, probably around 60 to 70 percent.\n* Starting from such premises, I think the chances are around 40 percent. I am a bit cautious and start my forecast with: 35 percent. * It will be interesting how the vote of no confidence will turn out which is scheduled to take place in August (https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/06/30/world/africa/30reuters-safrica-politics-parliament.html). I do absolutely not think it will lead to the resignation of Zuma, but it will show how strong his support is. It will become more problematic for him, however, if the vote will be a secret ballot (as - by the way - would be functional and usual in parliamentary types of government)."], [368, "2017-07-01T18:15:31Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-07-01T15:46:14Z", [0.28], ""], [36263, "2017-07-01T11:21:40Z", [0.6], ""], [28414, "2017-07-01T09:08:08Z", [0.5], ""], [26242, "2017-07-01T08:52:56Z", [0.5], ""], [4634, "2017-07-01T04:37:17Z", [0.35], ""], [13377, "2017-07-01T01:23:06Z", [0.41], "\"The recent leak of more than 100,000 documents and emails suggesting deals made between his administration and an incredibly wealthy family has triggered a no-confidence vote in August, meaning Zuma\u2019s improbable reign, slated to last until 2019, may finally come to a premature end.\" -- https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/30/south-africas-zuma-may-have-finally-met-the-scandal-that-brings-him-down/"], [368, "2017-07-01T00:08:33Z", [0.0], ""], [13377, "2017-06-30T18:11:22Z", [0.25], "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/jacob-zuma-under-pressure-to-quit-over-alleged-links-to-tycoons"], [691, "2017-06-30T14:18:36Z", [0.28], ""], [691, "2017-06-29T19:33:01Z", [0.28], ""], [30330, "2017-06-29T19:18:53Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2017-06-29T17:19:11Z", [0.0], ""], [36219, "2017-06-29T00:57:25Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-06-28T23:45:41Z", [0.0], ""], [861, "2017-06-28T15:38:25Z", [0.0], ""], [4634, "2017-06-28T15:16:52Z", [0.25], ""], [13788, "2017-06-28T13:10:16Z", [0.3], ""], [23234, "2017-06-28T12:48:45Z", [0.4], ""], [34353, "2017-06-27T18:10:53Z", [0.15], ""], [13377, "2017-06-27T03:01:30Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-06-26T19:54:30Z", [0.28], ""], [368, "2017-06-26T17:42:21Z", [0.0], ""], [30389, "2017-06-26T09:31:29Z", [0.35], ""], [7124, "2017-06-26T04:14:18Z", [0.15], ""], [23234, "2017-06-25T22:55:30Z", [0.36], ""], [36146, "2017-06-25T21:33:14Z", [0.45], "The courts in SA have given the go ahead for a secret vote in a motion of no confidence against the president.

Their judgement has provided a broad opening for Zuma;  the speaker of parliament, determined by the court must make her own determination about whether to hold a secret ballot.  Mbete, one the core 6  leaders of the ANC will undoubtedly argue for transparency and an open vote.  While this move seems innocuous, it provides ANC MP's (who view their duty to the party as foundational, and to society as secondary) with a high probability vote against the no confidence vote in Zuma.  A myriad of factors account for strict voting blocs within parties, in this case, understates the role of intimidation, threats and assassination squads against party members who do not tow the party line.  There has been a worrisome increase in the number of assassinated leaders, both intra and interparty in recent years ~ 3 -4 years.  Ideological shifts from the proscribed 'democratic centralism', a Leninist view of the role between party, state and power consolidation, remains a cornerstone of the 'South African democratic model.'  These views are a strong ideological holdover of the Stalinist and Leninist influence when the party was banned, its members and leaders in exile, and the positioning of their cadre training in the former Soviet Union, East Germany, Cuba, Angola and the myriad cohort support by autocratic and dictatorial regimes, notwithstanding the role of the SACP and global support by anti apartheid activists unaware of the  rooted views of communism.  While some believe in the correctness of their decisions, the primacy of the party and its unity moving into the December elections are paramount.  Despite Mbete's previous declaration of impartiality, she is a Zuma ally.

So far, he has been able to deter challenges to his grip on the ANC, thus the presidency, but the ever increasing problems he faces are building to a critical mass. Ironically, it is in trying to contain those growing problems that he will lose the presidency. In effect, through the effort of plying different stakeholders within his base of support, that is the ANC leadership and constituency, Zuma will have to either engage in deal-making or demagoguery, and both options have their drawbacks. If it is the former, the ANC leadership is not monolithic and is composed of diverse personalities and interests, all of which are jockeying for the aftermath of Zuma's presidency and if Zuma empowers one to the detriment of others, the ones left out will coalesce against him. For the latter, if Zuma attempts the demagogue route and engages in stocking racial and social tensions to keep power, he will alienate the leadership of the ANC and also incur a challenge from the far left.

First, if the opposition within the ANC succeeds in recalling Zuma, the most that the party can try to force is his resignation. Given what I've read about him, he doesn't seem the type of person to resign, especially as he tries to have his ex-wife assume control of the ANC after he departs office in 2019. A recall may increase the likelihood of a no-confidence vote, but the ANC (which has 249 of 400 National Assembly seats) would have to have a significant defection against Zuma. While possible, it seems unlikely as it would increase the vulnerability of the ANC. A recall might also increase the likelihood of investigations into corruption by Zuma and his supporters. The Financial Times has a good synopsis: https://www.ft.com/content/f43cef08-43a5-11e7-8d27-59b4dd6296b8 In short, while possible, I don't think it's very likely at this point.
