Since then, the races in Ohio and Wisconsin have moved more solidly into the Democratic camp. Overall, the race ratings at ScottRasmussen.com show four races with Democratic senators that are currently considered toss-ups: Florida, Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota. West Virginia is still tilting in favor of the Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin. Montana is leaning in the Democrats\u2019 direction but is expected to be competitive. Republicans, in contrast, have only three seats currently at risk: Arizona, Nevada, and Tennessee. With a good turnout this fall, projections at ScottRasmussen.com show that Democrats could win control of the Senate with a narrow 52-48 majority. However, a good Republican turnout could boost the party\u2019s majority to a 56-44 advantage. The Senate playing field is unique. Earlier Numbers of the Day showed that Republicans have far more seats at risk in both the U.S. House elections and the gubernatorial races.
