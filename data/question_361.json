From the perspective of the ASEAN countries (the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam), this U.S. economic disengagement from Asia is a leading indicator of a shift in American grand strategy away from an expansive, multi-faceted approach involving economic, political and military dimensions to one that is more narrowly focused on a military security strategy aimed at establishing a virtually impregnable defensive line (in a conventional military sense) in the Western Pacific running from Japan through Guam to Australia. Beijing\u2019s challenge will be how to take advantage of this window of opportunity to consolidate peacefully its embryonic 21st-century version of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Far from being a threat, the current incarnation of \u201cAmerica First\u201d may well be a boon to Beijing. Strategic Importance of ASEAN Neutrality A key element of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s grand strategy is to foster the neutrality of southeast Asian states in the event of serious conflict between Beijing and Washington. Ultimately, ASEAN neutrality means that no member country would host military facilities for the regular use of outside powers. From Beijing\u2019s national security viewpoint, southeast Asia is critical for two reasons. First, many of the countries\u2014most importantly the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia\u2014have overlapping and competing maritime claims in the South China Sea that could significantly impede China\u2019s efforts to establish a maritime cordon sanitaire beyond the customary 12-nautical-mile line along its eastern seaboard. Second, the countries sharing common land borders with China (Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam) serve as a buffer protecting China\u2019s vulnerable southeastern underbelly. Clearly, Beijing would prefer that its southeast Asian neighbors are not hostile and avoid policies that could adversely impact China\u2019s vital national security interests. To further this objective, Beijing has embraced an approach using the persuasive allure of soft power\u2014economic, financial and cultural incentives and inducements, with occasional demonstrations of coercive power, military actions and rhetorical saber rattling, to dissuade ASEAN member countries from banding together (and cooperating with the U.S.) to counterbalance China, and to encourage them to remain neutral in any larger struggle between Beijing and Washington over East Asian dominance. China\u2019s economic power provides the gravitational pull to keep the ASEAN countries within its sphere of influence. China is the economic engine of Asia, having displaced both the United States and Japan as the most important trading partner of the ASEAN countries. China is the single-largest provider of bilateral economic development aid to them. In addition, China is sponsoring multilateral institutions (from which the U.S. is conspicuously absent) such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), New Development Bank (NDB or BRICS Bank) and the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (BRICS CRA) to further reinforce and identify its central role in funding Asian economic development. The collapse of the American-sponsored TPP trade initiative due to the withdrawal of U.S. support provides a clear path for Beijing to assume the mantle of leadership and promote the Comprehensive Regional Economic Partnership (CREP), the regional trade alternative originally proposed by ASEAN and enthusiastically backed by China. Of course, there is an important cultural dimension that potentially enhances Beijing\u2019s economic soft power, as there are significant minority-ethnic Chinese communities with deep local roots and prominent commercial roles in each of the southeast Asian countries (with ethnic Chinese constituting the majority population of Singapore) (para. 1-3).

This time around he is about to re-align with the US.\nLast month, Manila filed a protest before the Chinese Embassy over Beijing's reported military buildup on the islands and reefs in the contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.\nThe protest comes one month after President Duterte promised to respect defense treaties with \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cally,\u201d the United States, and two months after Manila warmed up to Beijing and announced a \u201cdivorce\u201d from Washington.\nInvestors get unsettled with high profile flip-flops. They magnify political risks, which add to other investment risks. That's especially the case for countries like Philippines suffering from persistent political instability since the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, as Ruchir Sharma observes in The Breakout Nations.\nThat's why Philippines\u2019 equity markets headed south after Duterte flip-flopped.\nWhat made Duterte change his mind this time around? \nIt\u2019s hard to say. One plausible answer is China\u2019s ongoing aggression, telling America to stay away from its \u201cown\u201d South China Sea. And sending a warning message to Taiwan in the form of a naval force demonstration \u2013 recently, a group of Chinese warships that included the country\u2019s only aircraft carrier made its way to the South China Sea after passing south of Taiwan in a \u201croutine\u201d exercise.\nAnother plausible answer is a recent survey, which showed 84 percent of Filipinos want Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to assert his country's rights over its territories in the South China Sea.\nA third plausible answer is a new administration in Washington, which has promised to contain China\u2019s South China Sea ambitions.\nKeeping a record on Philippines\u2019 President\u2019s position on South China Sea disputes is a rather tricky task. Duterte\u2019s flip-flops can be traced back to last July after an international arbitration ruling, which found that China has no historic title over the waters.\nThat was a big victory for both the Philippines, which had filed the arbitration case, and its close ally the US, which wants those waterways to be an open sea (para. 1-11).

I believe that the election of Donald Trump will allay the row between the Philippines and the U.S. Trump has thus far narrowed American foreign relations to issues of trade and security. As a result, Duterte and his ego will feel safer against criticism from a powerful corner, and will be more willing to tone down his rhetoric and work with the United States. His recent appeal to Muslim separatist rebels against Islamic State also indicates a deficit in his ability to counter terrorist forces that the U.S. could bolster--a mission that aligns heavily with current U.S. foreign policy goals. Additionally, the Philippines is a linchpin in the U.S.'s strategy to counter Chinese expansion in the region, and Donald Trump made challenging China a top tenet of his campaign.

In addition, in response to the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague that Chinese claims over 90 percent of the South China Sea area are illegitimate, China remained defiant. Chinese officials even implicitly threatened to establish an Air Defense Identification Zone to control aircraft movements over her claimed territory, which shows Chinese willingness to act unilaterally despite non-recognition from other states (para. 5).\nAs the major counterbalance in the region, the United States responded by persistently operating \u201cfreedom of navigation exercises\u201d as well as joint military patrols with the Philippines and potentially Japan, Australia, and Indonesia. Furthermore, the U.S. also enlarged her financial support for enhacing the military capabilities of ASEAN and East Asian countries and strengthened bilateral defense collaboration with these countries.\nChina\u2019s rival claimants in ASEAN also reacted by increasing their defense budget. Compared to other ASEAN countries, Vietnam had the most significant enlargement, a 113 percent increase in defense expenditure in the 2004-2013 period. Vietnam spent $3.4 billion for military advancement in 2013 alone. Furthermore, Vietnam also actively engaged in strategic arms trade talks with India, Russia, and the U.S. since 2014.\nManila also moved to upgrade its military. The Philippines announced $885 million would be spent on purchase of \u201cthree guided-missile fast attack craft, two guided-missile stealth frigates, and two anti-submarine helicopters.\u201d As a traditional ally of the United States, the Philippines also actively participated in bilateral military exercises with the U.S. and Japan in 2015 under former President Benigno Aquino. And despite the earlier disruption between new President Rodrigo Duterte and U.S. President Barack Obama, the Philippines reasserted her commitment to military cooperation with the U.S. in 2016 (para. 5-8).
