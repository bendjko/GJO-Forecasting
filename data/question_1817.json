Thus far the resistance to a vaccine passport program has been concerns about equity and about asymptomatic transmission. Results of a study out of Israel a few days ago however reported the Pfizer vaccine reduced asymptomatic transmission by 90+%, though the study isn't peer-reviewed, which mitigates one of the barriers to discretionary travel.  Still not very likely, since the EU has said vaccine passports would take about 3 months to roll out and we haven't even started in the US, Canada's vaccine rollout has been woefully slow, their COVID cases have plateaued and stopped decreasing, and the other vaccines (especially J&J) haven't been studied for asymptomatic transmission yet. It would be a very quick timeline, and it would be a bad look for the Canadian government to be allowing obnoxious American tourists to come into the country while their own citizens are unable to get vaccinated. There's still the ethical issues surrounding vaccine passports that the Biden administration will probably not want to deal with. There's the issue of travel to Canada from the US meaning that money will be spent at non-American businesses, which the US may not want to promote by cooperating on a vaccine passport. Lastly, this has underpinned all of my forecasts, but everything in COVID takes longer than expected.  Canada also recently tightened its border travel restrictions (https://www.startribune.com/cancel-your-vacation-plans-canada-tightening-border-rules-amid-covid-19-pandemic/600023390/), which is going in the opposite direction of what you'd want for even a selective reopening. Even the Tourism Industry Association of Canada isn't pushing for a reopening of international travel, just a roadmap to do so in the future, most likely because they don't think travel will recover till 2026 so rushing is not as helpful as it may seem. They also mention that the Canadian government has been very clear that they want to promote regional travel within Canada before they promote international travel, and they are yet to take that step. (https://a628df72-7108-47d6-9152-562f641e49d8.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4fa6_f60a2b8f6712490ca5b711f88c42c295.pdf) (or google \"2021 TIAC Tourism Recovery Plan\" if you don't like weird links). Canadians spend more abroad than foreigners spend in Canada for tourism, so the financial incentive for international reopening isn't strong either.  It's genuinely difficult to find a yes case for a reopening. Maybe as a gesture to the US? There's too much going in the opposite direction for that to be realistic. Maybe if they can allow foreigners in but not Canadians out?

A universal system is considered as a part of a  socialist doctrine which is an anathema to Americans.\nThis has created an inability to handle the pandemic in the US as opposed to the Canadian model. The Canadians do not want to overwhelm their hospital system with importing further problems from the US, where the pandemic is out of control.

Travel restrictions were one of the first measures taken, and rolling them back has never been seriously discussed at any point since they started in March, leading me to believe that the outbreak will have to be at a very low and stable level before the restriction is lifted. The restriction has been renewed every 30 days on the 21st of the month without much fuss. I also focus on the US, since the decision to allow Americans into Canada will rest more on the status of our outbreak, which has been consistently worse anyways.  The only way that a low and stable case load happens is with a vaccine, thus probabilities almost solely rest on predicting how a vaccine rollout will take place, and what effects it will have. Dr. Fauci estimated that vaccines could start reaching everyday Americans, i.e. the type who would be traveling, \u201cas early as April and through July\u201d, so that's probably the most optimistic timeline assuming everything else goes smoothly. Before this point, essential workers and people like schoolteachers and food service workers would receive it as well. In that ideal world, vaccines would start reaching people April 1, and then the second doses would begin to be received April 21. The April renewal discussion would be then, right as the earliest people are getting their second dose, meaning that the traveling population is almost entirely unvaccinated still, making a restriction lifting highly unlikely.  The presumed next opportunity in that ideal scenario would be on May 21. A reasonable percent of the traveling population would be vaccinated at this point, in addition to a lot of people working in service sector jobs covered in earlier rollout phases. I would expect cases to be at a lower level by this point after the huge winter spike we\u2019re experiencing. What may occur at this point is the Canadian government opens travel through one or two ports restricted to people with negative tests and recorded vaccination as a test run to see if it\u2019s safe to do nationwide. This may lead to people swarming the border and may or may not be popular though, depending on what the case load looks like. If everything goes smoothly and the vaccines are highly effective in preventing transmission, and caseloads dramatically roll out as the vaccine is distributed and weather warms, it\u2019s conceivable. I consider it highly unlikely for a number of reasons. Firstly, a host of factors could hinder the rollout, including: vaccine not being as effective as initially claimed in the low infection count studies, people not taking the vaccine, distribution chain failings i.e. refrigeration issues leading to lack of effectiveness, and miscellaneous supply chain issues hindering production. Further, Dr. Fauci has been very clear about the importance of maintaining public health measures even as the vaccine rollout happens, since it\u2019s not clear how effectively it blocks all transmission. The vaccine is tested by looking at numbers of patients who develop symptoms and then test positive, not blanket testing the study groups. Its efficacy with regard to preventing asymptomatic transmission is unknown, and very important. For those reasons, I put the probability that caseloads are at a low enough level to even consider reopening in May at around 65%. Travel restrictions are also one of the easier measures to maintain politically, since they\u2019re simple to implement, have comparatively little impact on most people\u2019s everyday lives not near the border, and can feed off of resentment of foreigners, like Canada has had towards Americans traveling through Canada throughout the lockdown. Such a measure is likely to be a low priority for rolling back as outbreaks lessen under the vaccine, even if they would be possible. I also expect people to be less observant of guidelines as the vaccine rolls out and they consider themselves immune, which would make playing with a travel ban less likely. America\u2019s reputation for a poor response may be the most impactful factor though. As the ban gets progressively rolled back, it\u2019s unlikely that the US would be the first country on the list to unban for that reason. Lastly, Canada has been fairly conservative in their response to COVID, heavily deferring to public health officials, who would presumably not recommend reopening travel to a country like the US. In that ideal case scenario, the chance that Canada would be willing to experiment with a border reopening with the US is probably 15%.  All of those factors combined put the probability of any early border reopening fairly low, roughly 65% x 15% = 10%. We\u2019d need a near-ideal vaccine rollout, willingness to experiment with the ban before vaccine results would be entirely clear, and an appetite to do so among the Canadian population. It\u2019s possible that limited travel does become allowed for the sake of tourism dollars and experimentation if cases are very low by then, but a lot would need to fall into place for that to happen.
