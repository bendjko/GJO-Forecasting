Even with two major announcements this week supporting the use of Dogecoin, there has not been an increase in value that matches or surpasses the 15 February price of $0.058727 (\u201cDogecoin Price Index\u201d).

Mark Cuban announced on 4 March that the Dallas Mavericks will begin accepting Dogecoin for tickets and merchandise; the end-of-price that day was $0.050453 (Reynolds).  Dogecoin has some history of having social media pump up the value. In July 2020, a viral TikTok video caused a price increase of 35%, followed by a drop of over 60%. The recent high of 7 February 2021 of $0.082605, prompted by Reddit subreddits and tweets from Elon Musk, had already dropped to $0.058727 by February 15 \u2013 a 28.9% decrease. \u201cThe Dogecoin\u2019s Relative Strength Indicator, a momentum oscillator that measures an asset\u2019s speed and change of price movements, alerted about heavily overbought levels. That amounted to a deeper downside correction in the sessions ahead\u2026 The volumes also subsided, putting doubts over the rally\u2019s extension in the sessions ahead\u201d (Gola). While the price could be swung upward by another tweet or social media sensation, those have not happened frequently, and the current trend is headed downward. Since the price has only been above the 15 February 2021 price once in the past 20 days, I forecast a 5% possibility that it will close at a higher rate nine days from now.
