Also includes plumbers, hairdressers, electricians etc. that may have a filing cabinet at home that constitutes an office (for tax purposes). \nTherefore, the ONS statistics do not only refer to the minority of home workers in front of a computer, but account for the large number of the self-employed.\nThe inference here being that the Covid pandemic, while severely having an effect on business volume, would not change the dynamics of the workplace in general. 2)\tThe use of \u2018working from home Exclusively\u2019 rather than \u2018mainly from home\u2019 and suggests that office workers working from home (maybe not exclusively) during the pandemic is not a significant number considering the UK Labour force.\nIn April 2020 (the beginning of the pandemic) the ONS determined that the self-employed constituted 15.3% of the labour force Also, the current unemployment rate as stated by the ONS is 4.9% who are exclusively at home but not working.\nIn 2020 35.9% of workers reported some level of home working due to the pandemic, but this is only a 9.4% increase from 2019.\nAgain, this not working \u2018exclusively from home\u2019. ONS data show that two thirds of workers did no home working in 2020. A total of 35.9% worked at home to some extent (not exclusively).\n64.1% worked exclusively from their job site (away from home) for the whole of 2020. Therefore, as the ONS considers 15.9% of workers to be exclusive home workers, 4.9% are unemployed, this leaves a minority of workers who are normally office based but working exclusively at home during the pandemic to be small and probably hovers around the 20% until the government releases the lockdown measures.

While technically opening up pubs, hospitality etc. should probably be more likely to move people from \"Neither\" to \"Travelled\" rather than from \"Exclusively from Home\", I think there will be some impact; hotel manager who has been working from home goes in to see how things are doing, people go in to meet a colleague or go to dinner with a client etc.  50/50 a big move and 50/50 enough of a drop would get you to 25%, but I think the potential to lose that last week of data would effectively make this impossible, and with the bank holidays seeming to mean this does not get published (maybe 80% chance), hard to put this at more than 5% now.

In a monthly survey, belgian corporates are asked not just about \"organisation of employees\" but also about intentions for the future.\nhttps://www.nbb.be/nl/artikels/de-directe-economische-impact-van-de-tweede-lockdown-vooralsnog-beperkt-maar-de\n(available in dutch and french)\nFull time telework went from 30%+ during the lockdown (march-mayish) to 9% in september and back up to 30% during the current lockdown.\nAcross the economy the average number of telework days before and after the covid19-crisis was reported to go (weighted per sector by number of employees) from 0.8 to 1.4 days per week. \nStrange enough, the proportion of all workers in full time telework was expected to come down but lets ignore that as some of the sectorresponses look off for that part of the question.\nWith regular (not full time) telework for non-selfemployed at 5% or so, expect it to reach perhaps double that in a new steady state, to be achieved by years end.That means full time telework needs to come down a lot faster. Given the quick fallback between the first and second wave, and the expectation of a strong vaccination campaign (free in Belgium), it seems likely the total% will be below 20% again well before summer and probably already as soon as the current lockdown is a couple of weeks behind us so actually early Q2. \n\nThe UK differs here in two important ways.\nI learned (on this forum :)) that uk vaccine distribution will likely not be as mass scale as it was in Belgium.\nSecondly, full time telework (as reported by ONS, is this really 5/5days? seem a lot vs other countries but lots of highskilled workers i guess so probable) didn't come down as much as it did in Belgium during the previous \"belle epoque\" between LD1&LD2.\nEven if the UK is going for a similar end state as what i expect for Belgium (10% ET) it will likely take longer to achieve. So how to put all that in a single number: Q1 - 15% prob of going below 20%\nCompared to first lockdown, things look more difficult now with influenza season also peaking in Q1 so would not expect ET to fall below 20% before end op Q1 (95% probability).\nThat outlook would change if vaccine distribution speeds up (enough people vaccinated before end of q1 to go back to work \"unprotected\"? perhaps employers encouraging their workers but probably not to the tune of more than a couple %points of all labour). This is a low probability event in my book but perhaps another 10%. \nThen the journey towards 10% ET really commences. What happens in Q2?: remaing 85% Another wave before ET < 20% is not impossible (10%points) but other than that i expect ET to gradually reach 10% by eof. So starting February, that would mean 2%points decline per month for a lineair decline.\nThis puts the june-cut-off close to a 50-50 with odds skewed to the downside.\nI will go for 45% ET>20 and 45% below other factors: ONS seems to release data on a weekly basis now but will perhaps not continue to do so.\nThis could make mean another 1-4 weeks of declining ET is not in the final numbers. So i will count this as a couple of %points against seeing the expected decline in the latest report to be use (3%) 15% + 40% - 3% = 52% ps: ALl this doesn't take into account expected job-losses stacking up.\nIf those in more vulnerable professions drop out of the labour market to the tune of 1-2%points that could increase the number of people in telework again, but only slightly (for 30% telework the impact would be 2%point (1-0.98)/0.98 if those in ET are not overlapping with those being fired)\nif i include those and have this materialise in Q2 then i would arrive at a highly unsatisfactory 50% :)"], [21884, "2020-12-07T05:32:13Z", [0.77], ""], [31795, "2020-12-06T23:38:12Z", [0.85], ""], [92863, "2020-12-06T22:15:14Z", [0.91], ""], [172, "2020-12-06T22:10:13Z", [0.35], "Crowd forecast 85%.

It seems likely that the most significant shift will be in more people working both from home and at the office so the range should be between 1% and 18% and more towards the lower bound.  The potential to exclusively work from home vary by section (more when private), industry (more when knowledge workers) and size of employer (more when bigger).    Arguments to support more\n- Growth in private companies, knowledge worker industries and bigger companies will shift the balance up towards the 18% mark.
