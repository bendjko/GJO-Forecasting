On April 11, 2019 it was referred to the Senate Banking Committee (the same committee where it now sits) where no action was taken. Now, after passing in the House, there are a number of steps that must be taken in order to become law before July:\n1) The Senate Banking Committee doesn't just ignore it like it did last time\n2) It must make it to the floor and the Senate must either (a) pass it using the exact same language as the House did OR (b) pass it with different language that is corrected by a review committee AND approved by the committee\n3) Either (a) the president signs the bill OR (b) veto the bill FOLLOWED BY both the House and the Senate overruling the veto by a 2/3rds majority\n4) This must happen before July 1 So lets do the (really rough/abstract) math on this:\ni) Odds of passing 1: 25%, most bills (somewhere around 86%) don't make it past committee, but we'll bump up the numbers since it's already passed in the House\niia) Odds of passing 2a: 15%, the Senate is controlled by the Republicans and while about half of House Republicans voted \"yes\" on this bill, keeping the language exactly the same and getting 50%+1 to vote \"yes\" on a federal marijuana bill seems unlikely\niib) Odds of passing 2b: 25%, still pretty unlikely, but with a Republican-controlled Senate Banking Committee maybe there would be language that could be negotiated\niiia) Odds of passing 3a: 98%, Trump would probably sign it if it made it past the Republican-controlled Senate, but AG Barr, who supports a federal marijuana ban, and Trump, who is up for reelection and likely to cater more closely to a conservative base, keeps this from being a guarantee\niiib) Odds of passing 3b: 0.5%, this is assuming the 2% chance of veto (see iiia) and a 25% chance of being overruled (this number ranges heavily, I chose this number because if it passed by a supermajority in the House and the Republican-controlled Senate, I could see it being overruled. For reference, George W. Bush's 12 vetoes were overruled 25% of the time)\niv) Odds of happening in 4's time frame: 50% chance, there is no way to gauge how long bills become law. I said 50% because it could go either way when it comes to this variable.

Supposedly McConnell met with Marijuana Financiers about this bill recently, which gives me some confidence he will let it come to a vote, where it seems highly likely to pass. [1] Trump seems to have been pretty inconsistent on Marijuana, sometimes saying states should be allowed to legalize it and sometimes saying states should only allow medicinal marijuana.
