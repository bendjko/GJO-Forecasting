Too much significance was given to the loss of exposure from being excluded from the debate.  This time I will try to guess the intentions of the candidates from their travel schedules to the early primary states, especially Iowa and New Hampshire.  Travel schedules can be found in Ballotpedia.org [1]. Instead of looking at the total number of times travelled to the early states, I focused on the months of August and September.  These two months span the time that a large number of candidates lost their participation in the September debate.  The September travel relative to the August provides an indication of whether the candidates still stay to the primaries even with the loss of news coverage from the debates. The potential dropouts are limited to the 7 candidates that did not qualify for the October debates.  (I don\u2019t see any the October qualified candidates dropping out at this time).  They are Bennett, Bullock, Delaney, Messam, Ryan, Sestak and Williamson. \u00ac\u00ac Messam is not a serious candidate.  He has never qualified for any of the debates.  He has travelled to Iowa and NH a total of 3 times, and none in August and September.  He is not getting much publicity either.  I don\u2019t understand his intention.  He is a wildcard in term of dropping out.  He might drop out tomorrow or he might stay there for a long time. Delaney travelled a lot to Iowa and NH earlier, but his travel to Iowa dropped from 10 (August) to 2 (September), and from 5 to 3 in NH.  These are significant reduction of travel, indicating a high potential for dropout, especially considering his frequent travels earlier. Ryan\u2019s travel to Iowa dropped by half from 4 to 2 (August to September), but he more than double in his travel to NH (2 to 5).  He is in for the longer haul. The situation is similar for Sestak; reduced from 20 to 12 in Iowa, but increased from 0 to 6 in NH. Bennett, Bullock and Williamson did not change their travel schedule from August to September, indicating that they intend to stay till at least the Iowa and NH primaries.  Williamson even increased her travel to Nevada (from 2 to 4) while the other 6 candidates did not travel there at all. In summary, there is one potential dropout (Delaney) and one wildcard (Messam).

As a result, I think that this is the 2nd most likely option after \"one or two.\" I think it is more likely that no one drops out than 3-4 candidates drop out since looking at the qualification standards the only person who is on the line is Tulsi Gabbard. 2) One or two, I specifically think that one candidate will drop out.

TLDR:   Williamson and Gabbard have the biggest stakes riding on the debates.   Crucial dates:  When requirements for Nov released, and when qualifying for Oct is determined.  The DNC wants to winnow the field.   They will set the requirments for November to do that...."], [691, "2019-09-21T13:40:27Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.47, 0.03], ""], [14107, "2019-09-21T13:09:39Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.4, 0.05], ""], [79600, "2019-09-21T11:19:44Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [42004, "2019-09-21T06:19:08Z", [0.05, 0.3, 0.4, 0.25], ""], [691, "2019-09-21T01:25:13Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.47, 0.03], ""], [63401, "2019-09-20T21:52:54Z", [0.01, 0.6, 0.39, 0.0], "I think @Emil's analysis is good: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/907168 Plus Anneinak's additions: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/907186 My addition: Fringe candidates will hang on even if they don't qualify for the next debate. They know they can't win and have other reasons for hanging on other than a realistic possibility to win. So they won't drop out early.  I think the probability of \"none\" is close to zero.

[1] Roughly speaking this means that ~14 candidates would still be around in February, and no fewer than 10 candidates will be around in February (2 standard deviations away from the mean). So in the worst case scenario, 10 are to drop out by February. How many will drop out in the next month? If we divide the months equally it means 1-2 candidates to drop out in the next month. ~~~\nInside View\n~~~ The DNC is trying to winnow the field more aggressively than has been done in previous primaries. 11 candidates have qualified for the fourth debate in October [2].  Let's assume all of these candidates' chances of dropping out now are 0.  Below are those who are left along with my initial assessment of the likelihood. Gabbard - close to qualifying, let's say 10%\nBennet - has vowed to stay in past the 3rd debate [4], let's say 33%\nBullock - has vowed to stay in [3], let's say 15%\nRyan - has vowed to stay [5] , let's say 33%\nWilliamson - not much to lose from staying, let's say 5%\nDelaney - has vowed to stay repeatedly, let's say 10%\nSestak - 50%\nMessam - 50% Result: \n\tProbability\n0\t0.0724\n1\t0.2610\n2\t0.3342\n3\t0.2254\n4\t0.0880\n5\t0.0172\n6\t0.0016\n7\t0.0002 Also worth noting - DNC is set to narrow the criteria for the November debate [6]. Arguably, fringe candidates have stuck around because even if they didn't qualify for the 3rd debate they had a shot at the 4th because the criteria remained unchanged. However, the more the DNC tightens the rules, we should expect more drop outs. ~~~\nConclusion\n~~~ The Outside and Inside Views are more or less in agreement.  To watch:\n- candidates who won't qualify for the 4th debate but have vowed to stay on - watch whether they remain committed\n- fringe candidates like Sestak and Messam. I don't know much about them and my forecast is sensitive to more information about them.\n- just how strict will the criteria for the Nov. debate be [1] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/874330\n[2] https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-11-candidates-will-make-the-fourth-democratic-debate/\n[3] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/900465\n[4] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/900705\n[5] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/901273\u00a9\n[6] https://www.politico.com/story/2019/09/20/democratic-debates-2020-1505058"], [31251, "2019-09-20T17:51:50Z", [0.02, 0.26, 0.66, 0.06], "To qualify for the 4th Democratic debate, candidates have to meet the same criteria that they needed for the 3rd debate but with a longer qualifying period.

There are therefore 7 candidates who are most likely to drop out - the bottom 7 who won't reach the debates. We have lost the 7 of the 26 candidates since the opening of the race.  In the relatively comparable republican nomination for 2016 (where there were double digit figures) by this time we had lost 2 of the 17 candidates.
