The YTD average return in most of the Morningstar fund categories is near or above the YTD return on S&P 1500 index (of 16.2%) and in the last month all the fund categories exceeded the index return (of 1.3%).  Looking at the roughly 7,000 individual US equity funds listed by Morningstar, only 36% of them have underperformed S&P 1500 in the first four months of the year. Reflecting the weak 2018, roughly 58% of the funds are still underperforming the index in terms of 1-year return. As a result of this overperformance, I update my previous forecast clearly more in favor of the funds, assuming that the recent trend will continue for the remaining 2 months.

Using end-year data from 2001 to 2018 [see first page in 2018 end year report for the US - 2], the base rate is approximately: 0, 50, 40, 10. Inside view: This year the stock market has been doing remarkably well. [3] This suggests that an index is more likely to outperform stock picking funds. However, there has also been a lot of opportunity and growth in individual stocks (e.g. Facebook's recovery, Apple and Microsoft's large gains). Therefore, I am raising the 60-80 bin but only slightly. To consider: What drives >80% years? It happened in 2011 and 2014 which were both good economic years but not exceptionally outstanding for the stock market [3]. It would have to be a rare combination of good overall stock market performance and lack of outstanding performance for any individual stocks. This doesn't match my impression of 2019 so far so I am lowering the >80% slightly.

The average benchmark outperformance has averaged about 68% over the last seven years. The population mean is 59%, riding right on the border of two possible answers. I've run some basic descriptive stats on the data and tried to find a correlation with benchmark outperformance and some aspect of the economy or of stock market expectations or returns. So far I've found nothing significant in any comparative analysis.\nNow, this is somewhat anecdotal but as the industry consolidates and so many sharp minds, CFA's and PhD's, compete globally it is harder and harder to squeeze diminishing alpha from the market. Add to that the technology available at speed to aid portfolio managers, Regulation FD, which mandates full, fair and immediate dissemination of financial data - levelling the playing field for smaller or remote asset managers and the career risk involved if a portfolio manager makes a bad bet and the net result is performance in line with the market - its harder than ever to beat the market! Add in fees and this zero-sum game becomes a negative sum game and a larger percentage of active should underperform. Before costs, the return on the average active dollar will equal the average market return. Factor in costs and it shifts to less than for the active dollar. \n"], [691, "2019-02-05T13:19:04Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [67282, "2019-02-05T00:51:39Z", [0.55, 0.35, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-02-04T19:40:04Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [25780, "2019-02-04T14:43:58Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [8318, "2019-02-04T01:22:12Z", [0.03, 0.22, 0.64, 0.11], ""], [2406, "2019-02-03T19:11:15Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.8], ""], [6978, "2019-02-02T14:20:34Z", [0.0, 0.67, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-02-01T17:02:31Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [62975, "2019-01-31T18:32:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.02], ""], [62975, "2019-01-31T18:31:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05], ""], [21884, "2019-01-31T03:36:21Z", [0.04, 0.55, 0.36, 0.05], ""], [61938, "2019-01-30T17:42:27Z", [0.05, 0.55, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [63658, "2019-01-30T08:45:54Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [63290, "2019-01-29T22:50:44Z", [0.01, 0.21, 0.67, 0.11], ""], [62224, "2019-01-29T22:13:13Z", [0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-01-29T21:10:41Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [63691, "2019-01-28T23:59:55Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [63817, "2019-01-27T23:10:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [6978, "2019-01-27T14:17:41Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0], ""], [56, "2019-01-26T23:43:28Z", [0.0, 0.41, 0.47, 0.12], "Affirming for now.

Mid numbers from 2008 are 49, 55, 56, 49, 90, 55, 60, 64, 90, 63, 58. That gives us a baseline of 0%, 64%, 18%, 18%. But, clearly these numbers have a relationship with recessions.  Consider the annual numbers, we have the following from 2000-2017: 54.87, 58.34, 48.01, 51.43, 42.26, 68.02, 48.9, 64.91, 40.68, 48.28, 84.65, 64.91, 43.26, 86.89, 74.03, 60.49, 63.43, 57.98. If you go straight annual baseline, that's: 0%, 55%, 23%, and 12%.  We have about a 1/7 chance of being in a recession, so I think these numbers skew downwards. Recent trends have higher numbers. All of which makes me think that the 3rd choice edges out 2 and it is close to a toss up, also need to add some to the 4th since there is an element of random chance there - so I'll just go with the default, taking 2% off the first bin.

Interestingly, I could not find the reports for 2011 and 2015, the years preceding the years in which the upward outliers occurred. \nBy pure frequency of the available bins in the 17 reported numbers available, we could have a baseline as follows:\nLess than 40%: 0/17 --> 0%\nBetween 40% and 60% inclusive: 11/17 65%\nMore than 60% but less than 80%: 3/17 18%\n80% or more: 3/17 18%\nLooking at the S & P Composite 1500 (https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-composite-1500) it seems like the upward outliers occurred in years that had significant downwards dips of the index. The only time where there isn't a clear downward correction of the index in the period the reported number referred to is for 2014 end. The most recent dip seems to already somehow fit into that pattern, so I would say the probability that this is an outlier year should be considered higher than in other years.\nTaking this into consideration, I would not stray too far from the baseline at this point, with slight increase of probability for the 60-80 and more than 80 bins compared to the baseline. The report for 2018 end should be a good early indicator, so this forecast should be updated when that data becomes available at the latest.
