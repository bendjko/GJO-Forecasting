but not too far ahead, the biggest question will be will Klobuchar and Warren (also nest some significant support in Minnesota) stay in the race till Super Tuesday. It is far more likely that Warren will stick it through till Super Tuesday, but after a lackluster showing in Nevada and a predictable bad showing in South Carolina and no guaranteed victory in her home state, Klobuchar may retire early, in which case, as was the case in 2016 it is more than likely that Bernie will win Minnesota.
