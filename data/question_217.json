What are the chances of the parliament passing legislation limiting the use of the death penalty before this time?\nA bill was brought forward in December of 2015 to stop the use of executions for drug-related offences (https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/12/bill-to-end-death-penalty-for-drug-crimes/). However there\u2019s no evidence that this bill has been properly discussed or considered (as I understand it actual consideration of the bill relies on approval from other elements of the Iranian regime). Essentially I think this issue comes down to will on the part of the Iranian regime (President, Guardian Council) rather than the Parliament, the Parliament itself is fairly weak and unlikely to pass such a controversial bill without the will of the more powerful elements of the Iranian government. Various sources (https://majlismonitor.com/en/2016/03/analysis-2016-iranian-parliamentary-assembly-of-experts-election-results/) and (http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/iran-election-results-winner/472128/) suggest the Parliament is currently a mixture of conservative and moderate members. But one expert (Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment) suggests that \u2018the new parliament will support President Rouhani in promoting Iran\u2019s economic reform and development and will focus less on divisive issues such as political and social change.\u2019 I think the time frame also really limits the likelihood here so I\u2019ll start it off at 5%. What are the chances of the Guardian Council accepting any legislation?\nAgain, I think these two different questions are linked ie. it\u2019s unlikely that a bill will reach the Guardian Council without the Council having already agreed/supported it. \n\nI\u2019ll start off with 5% but I would have to see significant development to not bring it closer to 0% in the next month.

The use of the death penalty, and the terror that it spreads, has been a cornerstone of Iranian government control since the revolution. Even the reformist Rouhani has done little to agitate in favour of its limitation. Indeed, there is some reason to think that, since his appointment in 2013, the frequency of executions in Iran has actually increased (with 2015 being a particularly bloody year). Moreover, getting the Majles to consider (very publically) an apparently liberalising policy which then does not get past the Guardian Council is a common tactic in Iran - it is an effective, low-risk ploy used by the regime as propaganda both internally and externally to demonstrate their apparent 'openness' to new ideas. It seems unlikely, at this stage, that the death penalty would be reformed in Iran - the regime has little to gain and much to lose from doing this. Currently, the only factor that convinces me to raise my prediction beyond 10% is Iran's current international rehabilitation; renewed oil sales have boosted the Iranian economy, and the leadership is desperate to have greater influence on international markets. If an apparently 'liberalising' domestic move could buy Iran greater diplomatic and economic influence globally, then it may seem appealing to the leadership. However, this factor does not seem decisive (and, if anything, Iran has most to gain in terms of influencing oil markets from establishing a common purpose with its rival, Saudi Arabia; reforming capital punishment is not going to have any effect here)."], [23234, "2016-06-28T01:14:33Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2016-06-27T18:54:39Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-06-27T17:49:39Z", [0.0], ""], [26574, "2016-06-27T14:36:47Z", [0.65], ""], [11289, "2016-06-26T20:59:23Z", [0.15], ""], [26555, "2016-06-26T14:16:09Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2016-06-26T12:41:24Z", [0.01], ""], [135, "2016-06-25T18:32:24Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-06-25T13:13:29Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-06-24T19:28:42Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2016-06-24T19:21:24Z", [0.45], ""], [691, "2016-06-24T15:55:32Z", [0.01], ""], [26474, "2016-06-24T05:46:01Z", [0.08], "Unlikely in this time span.

The vast majority were for drug-related offences. Iran is one of the last executioners of child offenders, in violation of international law. Last year it executed at least four people who were under 18 at the time of their crime.  In states that have a high application of the death penalty, primarily for drug offenses in Islamic countries include:  China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia.  However, China (which currently has the highest death penalty rate), Singapore and Vietnam also implement policies for reasons of drug offenses of various kinds. A 1988 Convention formalized transnational cooperation in drug control and essentially \u2018internationalizing\u2019 the war on drugs.  In practice, this means a border control program between Iran and Pakistan could involve European Union donors, German police trainers, French equipment and British intelligence delivered in partnerships coordinated by the United Nations. Thus what happens in Iran is influenced by decisions made in Brussels, to say nothing of the international bodies interposed in this arrangement. When hundreds of people are executed for drugs in Iran\u2014a country that receives millions in drug control aid\u2014 every\nyear, it becomes impossible to dismiss these events as incidental \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 of drug control because so many parties are engaged in the context. The death penalty is not \u2018unintended\u2019 in Iran, and executions implicate the government\u2019s international counterparts. Iran has had capital punishment for drug offenses since the 1940s and 1950s.   The following law is in effect in Iran along with the data for executions between 2012 - 2014.   580 (of which 439 were for drug offenses) executions in 2012, 687 (of which 331 were for drug offenses) executions in 2013, and 753 (of which 367 have been for drug offense) executions in 2013.  Executions for murder has also been on the rise over the last three year period in Iran.   Acknowledging the difficulties of obtain completely accurate data in Iran, the previously specified data can be considered moderately high in its accuracy. Given the theocratic nature of governance along with Sharia Law, we will not see a relaxation of death penalty laws or any significant changes by the Guardian Council on this issue anytime soon.  If fact, the data indicates that executions have been on the rise, and is anticipated by regressed predictions, to continue over the next number of years.  Restriction of the use of death penalty does not seem to occur into other domains that are not considered 'reasonable' by Islamic Law.  However, if anything, one can anticipate an expansion of the use in other areas rather than constraint.  Executions by Iran is not considered by area experts to be \"unintended.\"  While it is possible that there might be some relaxation of the execution of juvenile delinquents.  In fact, one can expect with a reasonably high degree that Iran keeps their juvenile offenders on death row (until ready for execution (despite international law indicating that crimes committed [at the time of offense] before juvenile turn 18) until execution dates are determined.   Data on execution of juveniles in Iran # : Global juveniles  #.  2010 (1:1), 2011 (7:7), 2012 (4:5), 2013 (9:12), 2014 (12:12), 2015 (4:9).  This data does not include the global total of executions for each year.  It is restricted to demonstrate Iran's # executions of juveniles relative to other countries.  So for 2015, 4 juveniles were executed in Iran with a total of 9 global juvenile executions (without specifying country of origin). My assertion that we can expect no relaxation in the laws by the Guardian Council, requiring execution (either by adults or juveniles) to change within the near future.
