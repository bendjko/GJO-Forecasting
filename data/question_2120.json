The lowest so far this year is 40.4% on 27 Feb. The most recent highest (above 45%) is 45.3% in Sept 2021,  Question: What would cause Biden\u2019s approval rating to plunge or rise in the next 1 week? From Google, it was mentioned that for the rating to increase, \"Presidential approval ratings increase if there is a successful war going on at the time. War brings the country together with patriotism; this causes the people to be much more supportive of their president. Another factor is the health of the economy.\" For the rating to decrease, the three variables are inflation, unemployment and the budget deficit. They conclude that if the popularity functions are assumed to be stable throughout the period being observed that an increase in these three variables will lead to a decrease in the presidential popularity rate.\" Since inflation, unemployment and budget deficit are indicators with slower effects (we are looking at a week's time frame), the only factor that could dramatically affect the presidential approval rating is the possibility of the United States joining the Ru-Ukr war. If the US joins the war in the next week or so, there could be a increase in rating (rallying patriotism). However the probability of the US voluntarily joining the war in the next week remains low (I put it as 5%). Even so, the rating may not increase beyond 45% (I put it as a 50% chance) 50% of 5% is rounded up as 3%, which I distribute as 2% and 1% in the 45<X<50 and 50<X<55 baskets.\nOn the other hand, the effects of high oil/gas prices due to the war could have a continued decreasing effect on the rating (I put it as 5% that it could go below 40%)\n"], [87897, "2022-03-23T16:11:32Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2022-03-23T16:10:35Z", [0.03, 0.96, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2022-03-23T15:46:01Z", [0.1, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37236, "2022-03-23T15:30:19Z", [0.57, 0.43, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [81456, "2022-03-23T14:38:38Z", [0.09, 0.91, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2022-03-23T13:04:34Z", [0.08, 0.92, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [987, "2022-03-23T13:03:37Z", [0.03, 0.96, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2022-03-23T12:51:10Z", [0.06, 0.94, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [104252, "2022-03-23T12:34:28Z", [0.24, 0.75, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37893, "2022-03-23T08:54:36Z", [0.1, 0.85, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2022-03-23T03:46:48Z", [0.51, 0.49, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [105089, "2022-03-23T02:04:33Z", [0.01, 0.98, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [105089, "2022-03-23T02:03:04Z", [0.02, 0.97, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [97892, "2022-03-23T00:31:41Z", [0.02, 0.97, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [70711, "2022-03-23T00:06:41Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [99993, "2022-03-22T20:16:07Z", [0.01, 0.98, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [104054, "2022-03-22T15:27:11Z", [0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Despite a post-state of the union jump, President Biden is back around 42%.

Russia/Ukraine is a very dynamic situation and rally around the flag effect can cause very fast polling changes. Of course there's also inflation and other pains that could push approval down or counterweight. Overall, I upped my 40-45 chances, though, and shifted some chance from below 40 to above 45.

I will leave a 7% chance to cover cases where all the above situations remain an issue with one or more getting even worse for Biden. More likely I would expect a regression to the Mean as one or more of the listed situations shows sign of progressing towards a resolution. Especially if it appears that actions the US government was important in progressing towards a resolution. Above 50% before the end of March seems very unlikely as it would be such a drastic swing in such a short period of time. I am leaving a 5% possibility that some major crisis sparks a rally behind the flag effect (4% for 50-55%, 1% >55%). But do not see this as likely with how many hardcore Republican partisans likely to never approve of him. This leaves the 40% to 50% range.

I think we'll likely settle into standard polarization based numbers at some point, but would like to see the data.  I continue to think the crowd is too low on the tails generally, and in particular the chances for a spike above 55. That would only happen based on an external event that creates a 'rally around the flag' but there have been those under Carter, Bush HW, and Bush W (3 of past 7 presidents), although Carter's was fairly short-lived. Anyway, I have >55 at 4%, and 50-55 still high for some versions of rally around the flag.

The news flow from that presidency--because of its seriousness and impact on a variety of major issues (foreign, domestic, economic, etc.)--almost certainly included some events that would've very likely caused much more significant swings in pre-2000's US public opinion. The presidency before that also had a very low amount of variation in approval ratings, although arguably there were far fewer \"shocks\" to the political system.\n- The trends of Biden's and Obama's approval ratings during the first year of their respective presidencies seem visually fairly similar. Perhaps one reference scenario to keep an eye on might be: \"Evolution of Biden's approval ratings will closely track those of Obama's, but be offset downwards by 6-7%\"... All of these ideas are suggesting to me that Biden may now be approaching his \"approval-rating floor\", and approval won't go much lower, unless pushed down further by some future black swan event.

Carter, Bush HW, Bush W all had swings like that (3 of past 7 presidents) but Carter's was short-lived and timing leaves me with that at 6%\n* <40% would require a different black swan event, more like Mueller investigation in Trump. And even he was only there for a few months. I put that at half as likely, 3%. \n* 40-45 is only slightly below his 46% now... but it would require many more Democrats souring on Biden early in his term. Obama spent just a couple weeks below 45 prior to midterms. I rate this at 8%. I think the crowd is too high on this! Okay, so I have 83% left in the likely set between 45 - 55.

Obama struggled with this after a brief 'honeymoon' period above 60% and I think Biden may follow a similar but less extreme pattern; he's not as charismatic, but equally my impression is that he's not as polarising, and he's walking quite a tight path to achieve any gains, so I think his popularity may stay in a narrower band. Politics seems even more divided now than when Obama started, so anything much above 50% within 6 months looks ambitious.\nAs for the middle ground, a lot will likely depend on the economy and the fading Delta curve through the end of the year.

LOL! This initial forecast is based on some playing with numbers.   Looking at the 538 charts for other presidents, I calculated how much the approval rating for each had changed from day 234 until day 434.  GOP presidents, on average, gained .9%.  Dem presidents, on average, lost 6.6%*.   If I ignored party, the average loss was 2.6%.   *(I did not exclude any as \"outliers\" --HST was a huge drag on Dem averages! while GWB gave GOP averages a big boost!--because of extraordinary events, since an extraordinary event could occur during the time frame of this question.) Given that JB started off at 45.3.0%, that would put his rating at day 434  between 42.7 (based on the average for all POTUS) and 38.7 (based on Dem averages). Looking at it in another way, the approval rating of 6 of 13 POTUS improved an average of 8.7% between days 234 & 434, and the approval rating of 7 out of 13 fell an average of 12.2%.    That would give JB a 46% chance of an approval rating higher than 45.3 and a 54% chance of an approval rating of less than 45.3, with maximums and minimums around 54.0 and 33.1%. (Unless I'm all scrambled up,  which is quite possible!) Yet another way to look at is that JB's lost 9% in the last 200 days, so if he's on a straight-line decline, that would put him at 36.3% in 200 more days. How to translate all of this into a forecast?  Because Biden isn't a charismatic leader and congressional margins are so slim, making passage of big legislation difficult, I think his rating will not be volatile. I averaged my 4 methods of forecasting his final rating range . . .  Then I looked at the crowd's forecast.  Hm, with my forecasts at  68-20-11-1-0 I'm significantly more pessimistic.  That might be ok because on the last question the crowd was too optimistic. Then, I looked at the average of the forecasts of folks I'm following (7-23-28-38-4) and I'm more pessimistic than them, too.  hm.  That shakes my confidence more, but not enough to change my forecast. . . yet.  LOL!
