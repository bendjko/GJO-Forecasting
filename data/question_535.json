Total VINs registered with NHTSA is 18500 as of March 24, 2018. That is enough to cover production for the end of April 2018 for the conservative estimate above, and the second week of April for the optimistic estimate [5].\n3. VIN registrations have been ramping up with each registration larger than the last and time between batches getting shorter overall with the last batch registering 2655 VINs [6], which would probably present a more realistic view of the real rate of production that Tesla is capable of achieving or has already achieved.

It seems like Tesla sold 1875 Model 3s in January. Since sales are not deliveries, this is a slight overestimate. (One might worry that this is NEW sales and does not count deliveries to pre-ordered customers, but if you look at the 2017 chart on the same website you see that they are counting the pre-ordered customers.) That works out to <425 cars per week. A bit strange, since Tesla claimed to have hit (a speed that extrapolates to) 1000 cars/week in the last few days of 2017 [2]. So that figure seems to have been unrepresentative or downright misleading. (I watched a debate among auto industry experts, which I can't find now, that corroborates this. They were essentially making fun of Tesla's various technical claims, e.g. \"of course when you get the production line going it produces cars very fast, but that's meaningless if the line has to stop a lot because of robot failures or missing parts or whatever\".) Let's look at this from another angle. The best month for any single electric car ever was December 2016, when the Model S sold 5.8k units (in the US) [2]. The Model 3 has sold under 4k units to date, so there are 46k to go in 5 months. That works out to 9.2k cars/month, or 57% more than the best month ever for any electric car. (I'm only going to consider US deliveries for this question because Tesla itself admits it won't deliver Model 3s outside the US until late 2018 [3].) Given these considerations, I'm halving my forecast of >50k to 10%, but will keep watching for the Feb numbers.

Again with a linear growth of 194 vehicles per week it would achieve the production number of 49808 by the end of Q2.

No chance we break 100k. On the other hand, what would it take to go over 50k? Supposing the ones in transit get delivered, we are still 47,368 short. That's ~23.7k cars/quarter, almost as many Model Ss and Model Xs as Tesla sells each quarter, COMBINED. These are cars with mature production lines, which took years to put together, and years to ramp up to that kind of capacity [3]. The story being talked about right now (thanks to Musk) is how the production lines are difficult to put together, and certain segments of it keep breaking down or whatever. But remember the story for the Model X: back then it was that certain components weren't available, that the car \"has thousands of unique components and there wasn't enough supply of only about a half dozen\". Even if the production line issue gets fixed, who's to say there won't be a shortage of parts, or who knows what else? In my heart I think @dsarin is right to call >50k a 0% chance but I'm too chicken to go that far, so I'll go in between that and the crowd right now (38%, 280 forecasters) and call it 20%.

Average yearly production growth is 46% (excluding the 2012 to 2013 exponential growth of 750%) and the delivery numbers are as follows:\n2012 delivery number - 2650\n2013 delivery number - 22450\n2014 delivery number - 31655\n2015 delivery number - 50580\n2016 delivery number - 76230\n2017 delivery number - 100 000 (Tesla's own prediction)\nBased on that Tesla will by 1st of July 2018 deliver 199 981 Model 3 vehicles so 19 short of the proposed nice round number. Likely a few weeks of over time in such scenario will bump it to above 200 000 :). 5) 300,000 or more (0%) - with even the plus-perfect Teslanomics and an astronomical production ramp up of 200% monthly will not allow Tesla to meet this delivery number. Basing the calculation on ca. 420 numbers of Model 3 Tesla has produced up until end of September 2017.\nhttps://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP2I8ZIIzlldnvpNzH5OZm2WJV7vDa9kP7MtD-aQaL19bb51wSRwfIrHf3AwzuQ-g/photo/AF1QipPUWKGElprHGgV-HhozkVtArOzoSsLORprysSTz?key=Q2xNd09Wam91b29IZVJNNDFBeFYyYktpcFJPbVln My calculations might be flawed so I would much appreciate some feedback and I can also send people interested the references from where the data is collected with my calculations."], [1333, "2017-10-17T16:29:21Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "So Eon has taken on re-electrification of the PR and FIRED not layed off but fired 700+ and he blamed poor performance which stabs these folks in the back if can't produce product for them to deliver.https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/17/tesla-firings-former-and-current-employees-allege-layoffs.html\n"], [1333, "2017-10-17T15:46:17Z", [0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37379, "2017-10-17T13:37:31Z", [0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Thank you, @Censusguyz, for your latest news and analysis at https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/594316"], [5019, "2017-10-17T10:47:40Z", [0.15, 0.65, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [40799, "2017-10-17T03:37:31Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T21:58:15Z", [0.06, 0.46, 0.48, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37368, "2017-10-16T15:06:22Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35916, "2017-10-16T14:47:15Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.69, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-10-16T03:17:04Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [691, "2017-10-16T00:38:27Z", [0.1, 0.52, 0.38, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [12879, "2017-10-15T19:48:16Z", [0.01, 0.55, 0.35, 0.08, 0.01], ""], [37368, "2017-10-15T14:22:12Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.46, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [37379, "2017-10-15T03:06:04Z", [0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2017-10-14T21:24:05Z", [0.25, 0.65, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16404948/tesla-model-3-production-numbers-goals\nTesla has produced 260 Model 3s since the car\u2019s launch this summer, meaning the company is behind the original target of around 1,600 mentioned by CEO Elon Musk on Twitter in July.

Capacity would be added in tranches which suggests that the question can be broken down into two:\n1. How quickly can Tesla ramp up production\n2. How much production would be allocated to Tesla 3 Current capacity is a 55:45 split between S:X, with close to 50k vehicles made in a half year. Tesla would have to grow manufacturing by 200% simply to hit 100k Model 3s and not grow Model S or Model X production, which also seems unlikely. Given that the orders on books have no firm delivery date, Elon Musk should be comfortable with letting the orders stay on the books.

Their goal is to reach 5000/wk of Model 3 cars by the end of this year with a goal of 10,000/wk by Dec 2018. Based on Elon Musk's description of anticipated production \"hell\", I believe Tesla will experience difficulty rapidly reaching its target and that the first production cars won't leave the factory until Oct. Tesla just borrowed $1.5 b in debt (grade B-) as a cash cushion and has apparently structured these bonds to allow for repayment potentially after the first cars are sold. This will buy the company more time and allow it to slowly ramp up production while troubleshooting unanticipated delays. Incidentally, Tesla reports that there is a waiting list of over 400,000 buyers. Assuming a gradual linear increase in weekly production of Model 3s starting in October, I predict that they will produce approx 2000 cars/wk in Oct and increase by 500/wk every month thereafter. Thus, my best estimate is 8000 (Oct) + 10000 (Nov) + 12000 (Dec) + 14000 (Jan) + 16000 (Feb) + 18k + 20k + 22k + 24k = 144k.
