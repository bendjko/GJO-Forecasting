The question is really whether turnout will reach 50% or not. The same opinion polls referenced above are rather cagier on this:  of the six polls conducted listed above, conducted since May measuring willingness to participate, four give figures above 50%, and two - tellingly the most recent polls, at the end of July and in August, are below 50% (at 42% and 43%).

One might think the migration issue was at least as much an emotive, heartfelt, and to some degree irrational issue as  were the questions of EU or NATO membership. All three issues are deeply tied up with questions of national sovereignty and self-determination, particularly in a country that has known foreign oppression in the very recent past, and which has lost substantial territories to neighbouring countries (particularly under the Treaty of Trianon), the loss of which are still keenly felt by a non-negligiable section of the population. (Jobbik's rise in recent years in part relates to this, and its offshoot \"64 county sovereignty body\" referring to those former Hungarian counties now outside the country, but which retain substantial ethnically Hungarian populations) .    The context of contemporary migration quotas, in the face of large-scale migration from the Middle East/Syria also relates to a context in Hungary in which specifically Islamic oppression (during the period of Ottoman rule) is a fundamental part of the national story. And moreover, nationalism has been a fairly powerful, and vocal, force in Hungary in recent years - since around 2006 on, in particular. Yet the EU and NATO membership referendums, admittedly held before this upsurge in nationalism, and without this Islamic aspect to them, failed to attract 50%  of voters... (whereas a more technical referendum, in 2008  narrowly did so.) On the basis of past referendum turnouts, solely, I am inclined to suspect that surpassing the 50% turnout threshold will be a challenge. Also supporting this thesis: consistently low rates of turnout at European Parliamentary elections (in common with other Central European states): 38.5% in 2004, 36.3% in 2009, 29.0% in 2014.\nAnd similarly in local elections: , 53.1% in 2006 (at time of heightened political activity and demonstration), 46.6% in 2010, 44.3% in 2014. Parliamentary elections typically show a higher turnout: 70.5% in 2002, 67.8% in 2006, 64.4% in 2010, 61.7% in 2014.  A general and persistent downturn is evident, though. At the 2014 election, 44.9% of voters supported the Fidesz-led coalition, 20.2% the far-right Jobbik, and 5.3% the environmentalist LMP, all of whom support the \"no\" option in the referendum (=70.4% of voters in 2014  = 43.4% of the registered electorate).\nConversely, 25.6% of 2014 voters (15.8% of the registered electorate) supported the Unity coalition, which is urging a boycott of the poll.  Purely on the basis of past electoral form, and the most recent opinion polls, the 50% threshold will be hard to cross.  The case against seems mainly emotional, and related to on the one hand the levels of nationalist rhetoric that has been used in various government and opposition campaigns (posters for example; and the construction of barriers and barbed-wire fences at national borders); and on the other to (possibly exaggerated or not fully rational)  concerns about the prospects of Islamic terrorism being introduced to Hungary by potential future migrants - recent attacks in Germany, France, Belgium may be in mind.  Images of lawless crowds of young men  breaking down barriers, and memories of encampments of migrants in Budapest last summer may also bring out voters.  Conversely, compassion for genuine refugees - again in a country and of a people that itself has had a turbulent history (and which itself ultimately is of non-European origin) might encourage the vote to be boycotted, given the opinion polls universally showing the \"no\" vote well out in front... I am going to look further for evidence in support of things that might push the turnout up over 50%.  At present most rational, quantifiable, evidence suggests this will not be the case.
