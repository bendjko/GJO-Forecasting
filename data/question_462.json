A narrow majority of Turks voted on April 16 to change the Constitution in a poll that formally granted vast new powers to the office of the Turkish presidency beginning in 2019 and informally validated the already-authoritarian mind-set of Mr. Erdogan. But the legitimacy of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s victory has been tainted by accusations of voter fraud at polling stations across the country \u2014 and by an odd series of erratic decisions on the day of the vote by the judges who head the electoral commission. Eight of the 11 judges on the panel had been recently replaced. The opposition has questioned the results of thousands of ballot boxes, after videos showed evidence of ballot-box stuffing and voter intimidation on the day of the vote, and opposition campaigners faced prolonged intimidation during the campaign that preceded it. But the single biggest controversy was the last-minute decision by the electoral commission to override electoral law and allow officials to count what the opposition says are millions of votes that lacked an official stamp proving their authenticity. The decision has cast a shadow over the commission, known by its Turkish initials, Y.S.K. It was once one of Turkey\u2019s most trusted institutions, but it now faces accusations of inconsistency, incompetence and bias. The Y.S.K. board consists of 11 voting members selected from the judiciary, and four observers representing each of Turkey\u2019s four largest political parties, who can participate in the board\u2019s discussions but cannot cast votes. \u201cYou are not a referee. You are taking sides,\u201d Osman Baydemir, an opposition lawmaker, said last week in a speech that was aimed at the judges. Most of the members of the Y.S.K. board were appointed under controversial circumstances last September, when several thousand jurists accused of links to the group that the government accuses of orchestrating a failed coup were unseated. Three members of the Y.S.K. board were fired during this crackdown. Five other members left their posts earlier in the year, at the end of their terms, but had not yet been replaced. Eight new members were then appointed by a separate judicial body that was itself reconstituted in the weeks after the coup, as Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government sought to reassert its grip on state institutions. \u201cThe fact that eight of the 11 judges on the board were appointed during a crackdown on the judiciary, and amid such an environment of fear, raises questions about their neutrality and their willingness to vote against the government,\u201d said Koray Caliskan, a politics professor at Bogazici University in Istanbul. New details have now emerged about the chaotic way the board made decisions on the day of the vote, after interviews with three of the four observers who were present throughout their deliberations (para. 1-12).

The referendum also paved the way for Erdogan to rejoin the governing Justice and Development Party, which Yildirim currently leads, and formally move into the driver\u2019s seat of the Middle East\u2019s largest economy. The constitutional referendum left many investors wondering about the future direction of economic policy under Erdogan, who\u2019s adamant that Turkey should prioritize lowering interest rates to spur economic activity despite rampant inflation. Economic Policy Members of an economic policy team favored by investors and credited with driving years of rapid growth have been dropped from Turkey\u2019s cabinet in recent years. Erdogan has also employed a host of economic advisers who shun conventional approaches to economic management and advocate for a \u201cnew economic paradigm\u201d based on lower interest rates to fuel investment, production and employment. For more on the transformation of Turkey\u2019s economic policy team, read: Economic A-Team Down to Last Man as Erdogan Exerts His Power Erdogan\u2019s return to the governing party, also known by its Turkish initials AKP, was enabled by a clause in the April 16 package that revokes the constitutional requirement of impartiality for the head of state.

The interview was Yildirim\u2019s first since an April 16 referendum, which was preceded by massive government-backed stimulus for lending after the nation\u2019s slowest growth rate since a contraction in 2009. The referendum, backed by Yildirim, hands President Recep Tayyip Erdogan enhanced executive authority and by 2019, will lead to the abolishing of Yildirim\u2019s current job. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take such measures,\u201d Yildirim said of the economic stimulus program, speaking in a ballroom at the Cankaya Palace. \u201cThe revival of the domestic economy will increase even more.\u201d Investors have so far welcomed the outcome of the referendum, even as questions remain about how Erdogan will use his enhanced powers to revive growth, bring inflation under control and support the currency, which has lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar in the past year. The benchmark Turkish stock gauge closed at a record high on Monday, while the lira has appreciated 1.8 percent against the greenback since the vote. Infrastructure Spending A former transportation minister, Yildirim\u2019s attention focused largely on infrastructure investment. Turkey plans to spur spending of about 100 billion liras ($28 billion) in rail projects over the next 10 years, as well as pouring money into new highways, hospital developments, airports, shipping, student dorm facilities, electric energy and urban regeneration. \u201cThis is why Turkey\u2019s economy tripled in size and exports quadrupled\u201d since the ruling AK Party came to power in 2002, he said. \u201cWhile the world was running from crisis to crisis, Turkey carried out some of the largest projects in the world.\u201d Urban regeneration, which includes destroying and rebuilding structures that are insufficiently earthquake-proof, will help to drive domestic consumption and employment over the next decades, he said. Many of those projects will be moved off the government budget through partnerships with the private sector, he said. \u201cLarge projects can\u2019t be done out of the state\u2019s general budget because first you\u2019re going to do your spending on people\u2019s health, education and defense,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s money left over, you\u2019ll do big infrastructure projects.\u201d Because in the past that wasn\u2019t possible, Turkey turned to public-private partnerships and build-operate-transfer models, and plans to continue investing in that way, he said (para. 1-8).

Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who is responsible for negotiations with countries wanting to join the bloc, called on EU foreign ministers when they meet in Malta on Friday to consider a new format for relations with Turkey, one that could ease mutual frustrations and reinforce cooperation. \"The current situation is not sustainable,\" Hahn said. He added that he did not want to prejudge discussions among the member states on whether they should suspend Turkey's accession request, which they accepted in 2005. Hahn's native Austria has been among the most prominent advocates of a freeze. Some other states fear that could see Turkey act on threats to end a year-old agreement which has stemmed the flow of migrants to Greece and on to Germany. However, many in the EU believe Ankara has good reasons, including the financial aid that is part of the deal, not to stop cooperating on migration. The European Commission and its member states have grown increasingly skeptical of Turkey's accession process as Erdogan has cracked down on opponents and sought to increase his power. Turkey also questions the value of a process which few in Europe have seen leading to membership in the foreseeable future (para. 1-6). Macdonald, A. (2017).

Supporters thronged the streets honking horns and waving flags, while opponents banged pots and pans in protest in their homes into the early morning. The main opposition party rejected the result and called for the vote to be annulled. Election authorities said preliminary results showed 51.4 percent of voters had backed the biggest overhaul of Turkish politics since the founding of the modern republic. Erdogan says concentrating power in the hands of the president is vital to prevent instability. But the narrowness of his victory could have the opposite effect: adding to volatility in a country that has lately survived an attempted coup, attacks by Islamist's, a Kurdish insurgency, civil unrest and war across its Syrian border. The result laid bare the deep divide between the urban middle classes who see their future as part of a European mainstream, and the pious rural poor who favor Erdogan's strong hand. Erdogan made clear his intention to steer the country away from Europe, announcing plans to seek to restore the death penalty, which would effectively end Turkey's decades-long quest to join the EU. \"The crusader mentality in the West and its servants at home have attacked us,\" he told flag-waving supporters on arrival in the capital Ankara where he was due to chair a cabinet meeting, in response to the monitors' assessment. In the bluntest criticism of a Turkish election by European monitors in memory, a mission of observers from the 47-member Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights body, said the referendum was an uneven contest. Support for a \"Yes\" vote dominated campaign coverage, and the arrests of journalists and closure of media outlets prevented other views from being heard, the monitors said. \"In general, the referendum did not live up to Council of Europe standards. The legal framework was inadequate for the holding of a genuinely democratic process,\" said Cezar Florin Preda, head of the delegation (para. 1-8). Solaker, G. & Butler, D. (2017).

Erdogan called Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and the leader of the nationalist MHP party, which supported the \"Yes\" vote, to congratulate them, presidential sources said. They quoted Erdogan as saying the referendum result was clear. A \"Yes\" vote would replace Turkey's parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency and may see Erdogan in office until at least 2029, in the most radical change to the country's political system in its modern history. The outcome will also shape Turkey's strained relations with the European Union.

Opinion polls have given a narrow lead for a \"Yes\" vote in Sunday's referendum to replace Turkey's parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency, a move Erdogan says is needed to confront the security and political challenges Turkey faces. Opponents say it is a step towards greater authoritarianism in a country where 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup attempt against Erdogan last July. Western countries have criticized that tough response, and relations with the EU - which Turkey has been negotiating to join for a decade - hit a low during the campaign when Erdogan accused European leaders of acting like Nazis for banning referendum rallies in their countries on security grounds. He has also said Turkey could review a deal under which it limits the flow of migrants - many of them refugees fleeing war in neighboring Syria and Iraq - into the European Union unless the bloc implements plans to grant Turks visa-free travel. At a rally in Istanbul, one of four he held in the last hours before Sunday's vote, Erdogan described the constitutional proposals as the biggest change in Turkey since the country was established nearly a century ago, and the culmination of the response to July's abortive putsch. \"Sunday will be a turning point in the fight against terrorist organizations. We will finish what we started on July 15 this April 16,\" he told a crowd in Istanbul's Tuzla district, decked with Turkish flags and giant pictures of the president (para. 1-7). Gumrukcu, T.

The April 16 vote will decide on the biggest change in Turkey's system of governance since the modern republic's foundation almost a century ago, potentially replacing its parliamentary system with an executive presidency. Polling company Konda said the number of \"yes\" voters stood at 51.5 percent, but said its survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percent. \"When this forecast is considered within the survey\u2019s margin of error, a final judgement might be misleading,\" Konda said in a statement.

It said the level of undecided voters had fallen to 9 percent from more than 20 percent in January and there was no evidence to indicate their preference.. The survey by pollster Gezici put support for the constitutional change at 51.3 percent, with \"no\" votes at 48.7 percent after the distribution of undecided voters. The poll was carried out face-to-face with some 1,400 people in 10 provinces on April 8-9. In its previous survey a week earlier it put the \"yes\" vote at 53.3 percent. Gezici said many people did not want to express their views during the poll's fieldwork. It put the level of undecided voters at 9.9 percent. \"One of the basic problems with the work during the referendum process was the evident increase in the level of people's concern about expressing themselves,\" Gezici said in its analysis of the results.

High-rise apartment blocks have sprung up in a region long dependent on farming and fishing, and construction is about to start on Rize's first airport, the sort of projects Erdogan and his supporters hope will help win him a referendum on Sunday on constitutional changes that would boost his powers. Viewed with deepening suspicion by liberal Turks and some Western allies, who fear his Islamist ideals and authoritarian leadership are eroding Turkey's secularism and democracy, here Erdogan is seen as a hero of the pious, patriotic, working man. \"He wasn't one of these typical boys looking for fun and trouble,\" Erdogan's uncle, Ali Mutlu, 84, told Reuters in the town of Guneysu, where the president spent several summers at his family home as a teenager. \"His father didn't have money. He couldn't offer much to his son financially. Tayyip did it all himself. He earned it,\" said Mutlu, who is treated with great respect by locals, some of whom stopped to kiss his hand as he sat chatting in a tea shop. But Erdogan - Turkey's most powerful leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the modern secular republic almost a century ago - is also its most divisive. Polls show a close race, putting the \"yes\" vote slightly ahead, but with nearly half the country rejecting changes that would replace Turkey's parliamentary system with the executive presidency Erdogan says is needed to give the country strength. Even around Rize, there are pockets of dissent among conservative Turks who, while sharing the ideals of Erdogan's ruling AK Party, are uncomfortable with the powers being amassed in one individual's hands. A lone \"no\" banner flutters from an overpass near Guneysu, where the AKP won almost 90 percent of the vote at the last national election in November 2015 (para. 1-9). Pamuk, H. (2017).

It seems that repetition leads to belief. In social sciences what is called the \"truth effect\" is one of the many biases that simple folk confuse with reality if it is repeated regularly enough (para 5). Furthermore, if a statement, like \"the Arab people use so many number of words to describe camels\" varying from their walking style to their ages or \"we do not use most of our brains\" or \"Eskimos have x amount of words for snow,\" is repeated by so-called experts, then people tend to believe them without questioning their validity. So, during this constitutional referendum campaign the concept of \"one-man rule\" was the most repeated phrase. As Hanna Arendt, who was imprisoned by the Nazis, put it succinctly, \". . . what convinces masses are not facts, and not even invented facts, but only the consistency of the system of which they are presumably part. Repetition, somewhat overrated in importance because of the common belief in the masses' inferior capacity to grasp and remember, is important only because it convinces them of consistency in time\" (The Origins of Totalitarianism, 1951). During the referendum propaganda campaign, the naysayers have continuously repeated false claims, like the dissolution of Parliament or any other state functionaries. Their entire premises were based on the fallacious and misleading argument of placing all the executive power in Erdo\u011fan's hands. They have tried to conceal the fact that the package of 18 amendments is not about a change to the political regime, but simply a re-designing of the system in which \"bureaucratic tutelage\" would come to an end. The \"appointed\" intellectual and bureaucratic tutelage was based on the position of guardianship for their perception of modernity, which \"elected\" politicians could not challenge until today (para 5-7).

Given the rampant jailing of political dissidents and adversaries following the failed coup attempt, increasing antagonism with EU nations (who favor a \"No\" vote), and the retreat of the U.S. from the international stage, the Erdogan regime has little incentive to not suppress \"No\" voters.
