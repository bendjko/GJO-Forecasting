So if this year was a 'normal' year the number installed could rise or fall significantly from the 2019 figure. Since the number installed last year was unusually high I think 5211 would be a fair non-Covid estimate. But this year is not a normal year and is very much effected by Covid-19. Considering most EU countries are on lockdown and installing chargers is not essential I cannot see many chargers being installed in April or May. March will have been effected too although installations should have been carried out as normal in January and February (though I'm not sure how many chargers would usually be installed in the middle of winter). As for the rest of the year, that remains to be seen. I suspect things will pick up but we cannot rule out the possibility of a second wave of the virus or economic issues effecting EU countries ability to install chargers.

Shops are open, a few people looking, but nearly nobody demand others like food. The demand curve slope will remain low over a period of 9 months until a vaccine against SARS-Cov-19 is available.
