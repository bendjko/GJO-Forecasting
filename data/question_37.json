Ambition: Biden is an intensely ambitious man whose sole objective has been the presidency. Evidence: Biden is the only U.S. senator who has never accumulated a fortune; never sought or received a lucrative private equity/investment or consulting or lobbying position; never sought to cash in on his fame via five- or six-figure lectures or million-dollar book royalties, or any other profit-seeking venture. He is 100% a political animal, perhaps the last remaining such figure in our national political life.\n2. He has plenty of time to win: the notion that it's too late to enter and win is unsupported by logic or evidence. First, Biden's campaign apparatus can easily and rapidly raise money, and in any case his name recognition is already high enough that he needs less advertising spend than any other candidate, in either party.  Secondly, it is the Democratic Party's superdelegates, not the Party rank-and-file voters, who determine the nominee. These are ruthlessly pragmatic professionals who simply want to win the presidency. Most have no particular loyalty to the Clintons. More than a few are intensely loyal to Obama, and still harbor bitter feelings over the 2008 race. These superdelegates would gladly switch to Obama's most loyal ally (and his likely designated heir).\n3. Biden's model here is Bobby Kennedy (RFK), another high-profile executive branch figure who jumped into the race in March 1968 and quickly vaulted to the forefront - even though Kennedy was a far more divisive and controversial figure. Like Biden, RFK had zero interest in money and was motivated instead by lifelong, burning ambition, stoked in part by personal resentment of a Democratic rival. Biden probably does not resent the Clintons to anywhere near the degree that RFK hated Lyndon Johnson, but he is a politician through and through. Biden knows that he is a far better politician than Hillary Clinton and that he was the force behind most of the major achievements of the Obama administration (including the extraordinarily successful rescue of GM, the prevention of financial collapse, and the passage of the stimulus bill in the face of Republican obstructionism). The party's superdelegates also know that Hillary is a weak candidate with no better than a 50-50 chance of defeating Rubio or Bush, both of whom Biden would easily defeat through a combination of very high African-American turnout and white working-class support across Ohio, the rest of the industrial heartland and the other battleground states. \nBiden wants the presidency, and he will announce well before Thanksgiving. 75% odds that he announces by noontime ET Monday Nov. 2."], [102, "2015-10-17T17:31:49Z", [1.0], "Some common sense.

The thinking goes that he has no lane in which to run, and no real rationale either. . . . [this friend] suggests the possibility that this was Biden's plan all along. \"Remember the 2004 campaign, when Kerry was the presumed front runner, but some expected a late Biden entry into the race? Biden waited, and waited, and waited, and by the time he announced his decision not to run in August 2003, he declared: \"You just can't parachute into a presidential campaign.\"  . . .  \"In other words, what we are witnessing is a rerun, even with a strange and unhappy similarity in that there was a key family reason . . .  that impacted the decision. Many concluded in the aftermath of the 2003-2004 episode that Biden never intended to run, but that he enjoyed the limelight and attention (no surprise there, and certainly nothing unique to him), and waited as long as he reasonably could play the game, only to wisely declare that it simply was too late.\n. . .\n\". . .  when he declares that he will not run, it [appearances of campaign planning] will turn out to have been no more real than it was a dozen years ago. None of this implicates his current or past advisers, most of whom no doubt believed they were engaged in a serious effort, and one they thought could influence his thinking. Bottom line is that it's not a revelation that it's too late. Biden has executed his game plan, one that heightens his profile and stature. It's flattering to hear how much the country needs you to get in the race. \"The only problem for the man is that he falls short of his dream.

Now that I've given it more thought, here's my rational for this adjustment: Pro - 1. Veeps running is a thing. Since the end of WW2, nine of thirteen Veeps have run for President, which would give us a base rate of 70%. I've discounted it 12% because three of them became Presidents due to the resignation or death of the sitting President, then ran. So 58% percent in the go column. 2. The guy's run twice before, and past behaviour counts, to a degree. Give it 10%. 3. Positive media attention does have an impact, but I don't think it's anywhere near what people think. 5%. 4. Rumours and innuendo can't be discounted entirely. Another 5%. Total in the Pro column: 78% Con - 1. Per Nick Silver, with almost all the major party endorsements to date for Clinton ( http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/ ) you've got an establishment guy going against the establishment's choice. Big 50% agin. 2. Why? Without Clinton truly imploding, and with no fundamental policy differences between them, or a disenfranchised part of the party to speak for (unlike Sanders) he has no compelling reason TO run. At least 10% against. 3. Legacy. The man is seventy and looking at the end of his career. I don't think he wants his last hurrah to be the spoiler hurting the presumptive nominee. Another 10% against. 4. Highly unlikely chance of winning. Latecomers to the race rarely win the nomination, and even if he did, just because Veeps run (see item 1 in the Pro column above) definitely doesn't mean they win. If you discount the guys that won because they became President first (Johnson, Truman) and the guy who won after he spent eight years in the woods (Nixon) only one Vice President has won the Presidency right after being Veep - George HW Bush. That said, its not  like the unlikelihood of winning stopped Biden before (see item 2 in the Pro column). Give it 5%.

She also has an advantage over Mr. Biden across every dimension of primary strength. She has more endorsements, fund-raising and elite support. She leads him in every poll, in every state, across every demographic group. At the moment, the likeliest outcome would be that Mr. Biden wins zero states. \"There are few reasons to believe that Mr. Biden is such a compelling political figure that he could simply snatch away Mrs. Clinton\u2019s coalition. He twice ran for the presidency with little success. He was vice president for eight years, but there was not a groundswell of support for him to join the race. He may be riding high in recent polls, but sustaining high favorability ratings after jumping into the fray and becoming a more politicized figure could very well be a different story. He would face attacks about his long and often fairly moderate record in the Senate, on issues like crime, finance or Iraq. \"The challenge is even greater because Mr. Sanders has already consolidated much of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s natural opposition, and it is a stretch to suggest that Mr. Biden \u2014 an establishment Democrat with a record not that different from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u2014 would have a real chance of peeling away Mr. Sanders\u2019s enthusiastic and loyal supporters. \"But unlike Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden is acceptable to party elites, and nearly all Democratic voters see him as \u201celectable.\u201d He is well known and liked by less-educated and more moderate Democrats, and his relationship to Mr. Obama could ultimately help among black voters as well. \"If Mrs. Clinton faltered, which is imaginable as long as the email controversy lingers, Mr. Biden would be poised to capitalize. Just as Mrs. Clinton is the second choice of Biden supporters, Mr. Biden is the second choice of Clinton supporters. \"The scenario in which Mrs. Clinton implodes and leaves Mr. Biden to a one-on-one contest with Mr. Sanders is unlikely. But Mr. Biden would be the favorite in that event, even if he had to make up ground against Mr. Sanders in fund-raising and organization. A YouGov poll showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Sanders by a 58-to-42 margin in a one-on-one contest \u2014 even though he would trail Mr. Sanders in a three-way race \u2014 by claiming most of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support among older and nonwhite voters. \"A more likely possibility than a Clinton implosion is that she has been more deeply damaged by the email controversy than currently believed or will be hurt by future developments. In that case, Mr. Biden\u2019s presence would allow Democratic elites to bail out on her, rather than trying to shore up her campaign, knowing they had an acceptable and electable alternative. \"Mrs. Clinton would still be very difficult to defeat, thanks to her substantial resources and strong base, and it could lead to something like a true three-way race. Even if Mr. Biden couldn\u2019t ultimately defeat Mrs. Clinton, he would make her path to victory much longer.\n. . . \n\"What we know for sure is that Mrs. Clinton would start a three-way race with a big edge, and that Mr. Biden is the type of candidate who would have a chance of taking that advantage for himself if she ran into more trouble. And if he doesn\u2019t run? She goes back to being an overwhelming favorite for the nomination. His decision is easily the most important political story of the moment.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-clue-suggests-biden-may-run \"Joe Biden has taken another step toward entering the Presidential race. \"Representatives of the Vice-President held a meeting this week with Democratic National Committee staffers.

The session included a level of detail that would only be of interest to a candidate who is serious about running. For example, the briefing included information about issues such as whether a particular primary state requires a candidate to send a letter to the Secretary of State in order to get on the ballot, or circulate a petition, or pursue some other method. \"But, while the briefing is considered an important step for any candidate who is serious about entering the race, how it will affect Biden\u2019s decision is unclear. It may simply be that Biden is still gathering the necessary information to help him make a final determination.

CNN reported that advisers had instructed him to choose whether to run by the end of September. In August, the Associated Press reported that a decision was coming after a weeklong retreat with his family; two weeks later, the AP reported that he would make a decision by Oct. 1. In September, the Wall Street Journal said a decision could come \"well into the fall.\" This week, CBS News reported that he could come down one way or another within seven to 10 days. At some point along the way, it became clear that things weren't moving as quickly as envisioned, which prompted Salon to run a piece in late September titled \"What is Taking Joe Biden So Long?\" This week, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank lampooned the \"never-ending\" Biden delay. Google the phrase \"Will he or won't he,\" and you'll find a Weekly Standard article on Biden from April, a Politico item from August, an MSNBC segment from a few weeks later and a Washington Post article from October. The Post followed up that article Wednesday by polling readers about whether or not they think the VP will run.

He couldn\u2019t easily make up for lost fundraising opportunities, for example. And at some point \u2014 likely in mid-November \u2014 he\u2019d begin to encounter logistical challenges, like having failed to meet the filing deadline in New Hampshire and other early states. At the same time, Biden has little rationale to enter the race this late except as a break-glass-in-case-of-Clinton-emergency candidate. His formal entry into the race would imply that Clinton\u2019s campaign was under serious threat. The party establishment, most of which is extremely supportive of Clinton, wouldn\u2019t like the signal that sends out. But one detail that made it into several of these stories is that he plans to wait until September to make any decision. Although there are other plausible explanations, the simplest one is that Biden is biding his time, waiting as long as possible to see if Clinton is in more trouble than she appears to be right now.\n~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT: And here's the link for the list of filing deadlines: http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-real-presidential-deadlines/\nScroll down to Table 1.

Time is really the only healer. \n-the longer he delays a decision, the more free (and so far positive) press he gets\n-the longer he delays a decision, the longer he avoids all the negativity of a campaign   So, I think he'll continue to alternate  doing public things to soak up all the warm vibes and taking time to think/deliberate/grieve.
