My guess is that each agency reviews countries on a regular schedule.  The schedule may be tied to specific economic releases for the country region and world ( commodities market in particular ). Looking at seasonal times the report has been done in the past here:  https://tradingeconomics.com/chile/rating , I see 2/37 reviews done between May 19 and June 29th.   \nAdding a bit for uncertainty, starting with a 7% chance a review even happens. 2) If there is a review, paying attention to just S&P changes, there were 11 reviews and 6 changes since 1992.  \nCut the 7% down to 3.5% for a review and change. 3) Would there be a reason for a change if there was a review?\nI'll use GDP growth as indicator because S&P analysts seem to frequently quote it in their explanations. When Chile was first upgraded to AA- by S&P in 2012, it expected GDP growth of 5.5% after having experienced 6% in 2010 and 2011:\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/chile-ratings-sandp/update-2-sp-raises-chiles-credit-rating-to-aa-minus-idUSL1E8NQ6KM20121226. When Chile was downgraded to A+ in 2017, S&P analysts quoted GDP growth of 2% predicted for 2018.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0c5abd69-b085-3dfd-a1da-a4bd9818de7f Now Chile is experiencing growth of 4.2%. http://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/banking/chile-watch-q1-gdp-growth-tax-rules-for-digital-assets/.
