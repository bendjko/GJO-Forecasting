He is able to serve two eight-year terms but if that was an option it would have likely been taken. No matter how the 12 Dec 19 election goes, the government will be required to replace Carney quickly. This will facilitate a reasonable handover and smooth transition.

Hence I look only at the 2 publicized deadlines: (a) Sajid Javid postponed the announcement of the next BOE governor until after the general elections on 2019-Dec-12; and (b) Mark Carney will remain in his role until 31 January 2020, There are 51 days between these 2 dates (20 days in 2019 Dec, 31 days in 2020 Jan) when an announcement might be made.  Adjusting for the obvious days in which announcement are unlikely - election day and day after, Christmas, and New Years Day, we have 47 days left.  That leaves 17 possible days for announcement in 2019 Dec and 30 days in 2020 Jan.

If there is a hung parliament this will push the date into next year, but in my opinion this is unlikely.
