Turkey is neither, with close economic ties with the EU, membership in NATO, dynamic and evolving relationships with Russia, and a more assertive and expansive foreign policy throughout the Mediterranean region. Tensions between Turkey and some EU nations are inevitable given an acrimonious (and unfruitful) EU accessions process that doesn't favor the Turks and breeds distrust. These are all contextual factors that, 1) given that EU arms embargos are not common against non-isolated nations, 2) EU arms sanctions require unanimity amongst the EU (which doesn't exist on most issues anyways) 3) there is not much time to gain this consensus before the end of the year, 4) there are steps available short of an arms embargo (censure, non-binding resolutions, interim economic or other such sanctions that make it unlikely to see arms sanctions before the end of this year"], [96756, "2020-11-18T15:49:40Z", [0.05], "EU uses arms embargos, but doesn't use them lightly. https://www.sipri.org/databases/embargoes Although relations have soured recently, Turkey and the EU are still economically intertwined, and key EU presidential rotations are favorable to closer Turkey-EU toes.

I do not think that arms embargos happen frequently enough that a base rate can be established in general, but to construct a base rate would require specific contextual information that would be debatable at best. Thus, I think that contextual information about voting patterns in recent EU votes against Turkey is more relevant. That rhetoric around Turkey, Cyrpus, and Greece has been increasing dramatically with arms sanctions implemented on Turkey by many of its NATO allies last year for its support of anti-Kurdish operations in Syria. The Rhetoric around Cyprus and the Eastern Med has been mutually divisive with the EU condemning Turkish actions and successfully implementing economic and travel sanctions in 2019 (https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/49/?search=%7B%22value%22:%22%22,%22searchType%22:%7B%7D%7D,) Despite the interrelatedness of EU and Turkish economies, but these economic sanctions were limited to only individuals who were involved with drilling in Cypriot designated waters. While the Turkish President recently called for a two-state solution in Cyrpus (https://www.politico.eu/article/erdogan-calls-for-two-state-solution-for-cyprus/). Additionally, the US lifted its arms embargo on Cyprus in Sep 2020. Given that Cyprus is an EU member and Turkey is calling for its division, I believe some form of arms sanctions are likely in the near-term in response from the EU member states, but an EU arms embargo would require a unanimous decision by the European Union Member States in Council (https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/cfsp/sanctions/docs/index_en.pdf , page 7). Germany remains a major benefactor of Turkish arms sales as @DNK89 pointed out. Thus, an arms embargo (taken to mean a complete prohibition on arms sales from the EU) seems unlikely given the targeted nature of previous sanctions and the requirement for unanimity. The likelihood of Cypriot, Greek, and/or French arms embargoes or targeted denial of specific arms to Turkey to send a message is much greater than a complete prohibition on arms sales."], [95262, "2020-11-16T16:02:19Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-11-16T07:06:18Z", [0.0], ""], [96937, "2020-11-15T22:53:27Z", [0.3], "There is increasing rhetoric between France (major EU influencer) and Turkey over Libya & NK conflict.

There are also a large variety of other sanctions that can be used instead.\nGreece, which is the main concerned country is not 100% supporting an embargo, because, as Hungary and Malta, it fears the threat of an immigration flow that Turkey could release in retaliation. Germany, Spain, and Italy have economic interests that may affect their desire to apply an arms embargo. All those countries opposed their veto to a proposition of an arms embargo in 2019. However, the situation is much different in 2020 and has escalated. Since Turkey is rejecting dialogue and, on the contrary, increases its threats, the tension escalates on both sides. I believe only Hungary and Malta may be opposed to an embargo now. The stronger will of the other EU countries may force them to oblige, provided that concessions are made or actions are taken to deal with the migration problems.\nThe recent waves of terrorism attacks (though not directly related to migration) have given more incentives to seriously address the migration issue (I heard some official declarations on the subject which pointed to an EU consensus). It will very likely be debated in December. Therefore, there's a possibility that Hungary and Malta agree on the arms embargo if their concerns regarding migration are tackled simultaneously through another set of decisions and actions.\nAs far as other countries (external to the EU) are concerned, I see no potential pressure that could prevent the EU from taking sanctions. EU sanctions do not apply to non-EU countries, and, in particular, the US and the UK (who are both selling arms to Turkey) would not be affected. However, this simple fact may also discourage the EU to apply any sanctions that may then be ineffective (as Turkey claims they would), especially if Russia keeps trading arms with Turkey too. Moreover, it is true that Turkey has a growing military industry that is more and more able to sustain Turkey's needs (at least for short term needs).\nTherefore, I estimate a 90% chances that sanctions will be discussed in December. 80% chances the question of Arms embargo will be discussed in that case (thus 72% overall). 50% chances it will be put to a vote (=> 36%). 70% chances it will be a unanimous yes, if voted.\nHence, I get a 25% overall (I have multiplied all those percentages). Note: I consider that members of the council will have a good idea of the outcome of the vote prior it, but they may still feel voting is a useful strategic move to threaten Turkey (as they probably did in 2019). Turkey is part of NATO but it is a separate organization and it seems that it would not have an impact on this EU decision.
