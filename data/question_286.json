While the current population are elated at recent events, it is necessary to ask whether there is mass illusion, acquiesce, or irrationality at a national and a domestic level.  Even though Mnangagwa is currently head of ZANU - PF, will he simply be installed as state president by party rule?  Will the ruling party simply bypass the constitutional requirements of electoral processes?  Will the military (a coup claimed as a non coup) rule, in the interim to appease international and domestic actors and investors who require stability? The ideological nature of the Zimbabwean population, the state, party ( essentially identical in nature) continues to rest on the Leninist/Stalinist authoritarian paradigm, supported by a majority of SADC states (dressed in democratic policies, but essentially derive from the same ideological roots in the alliances, with the exception of Botswana and perhaps 1 other) will not change its political nature by a \u2018non coup event\u2019.  The dynamics of authoritarian - relative democratic transition is complex in nature, and requires rebalancing an entire social structure through dynamic \u2018revolution\u2019.  What does does this portend for violent/ peaceful change?  Military structures do not refrain from rule after its taste of power.   The empirics of its politics and how it comport with reality belies a reliance on the current mass delusion of democratic change. This leaves the question of whether Zimbabwe will have a president and maintenance of its political structure before 2018?  I suspect that it will not occur prior to 2018 without the tightening of international constraints by economic and political actors who seek to democratize the region and Zimbabwe in particular.  The vacuum of military rule until  president is lawfully I stalled will take some time.

The only way for him to be removed from office constitutionally, outside a general election, is for Parliament to impeach him. Impeachment Impeachment means charging the holder of an office \u2013 in this case the President \u2013 with misconduct and removing him from office if he is found guilty. The first thing to remember is that it is essentially a political process rather than a legal one.  The decision to impeach a head of State and to remove him or her from office, if found guilty, is made on political rather than legal grounds.  The Constitution does however lay down a procedure for impeachment. Under section 97 of the Constitution impeachment is a three-stage process: First, the Senate and the National Assembly must meet in a joint sitting and resolve, by a simple majority of their total membership, that the President should be removed from office on any one or more of four grounds:\nserious misconduct\nfailure to obey, uphold or defend the Constitution\nwilful violation of the Constitution\ninability to perform his duties because of physical or mental incapacity.\n[Note:  An arguable case could be made for charging President Mugabe with all four grounds] Once a resolution has been passed, Parliament\u2019s Committee on Standing Rules and Orders must appoint a nine-member committee of Senators and members of the National Assembly to investigate the removal of the President.  Although section 97 of the Constitution does not say so, the committee would have to give the President a full opportunity to respond to the allegations against him \u2013 he has a right to a fair hearing under section 69 of the Constitution.\nIf the committee recommends that the President should be removed from office, the Senate and National Assembly must meet, again in joint session, to deliberate the recommendation, and if in that joint session they resolve by a two-thirds majority of their total membership to adopt the recommendation then the President immediately ceases to hold office.\nImpeachment is an elaborate process and would take time to complete.  How long is difficult to say, because Parliament\u2019s Standing Orders do not specify what notice must be given of impeachment motions, nor how joint sittings of the two Houses are convened \u2013 in fact they do not deal with impeachment at all.  In the absence of a laid-down procedure, presumably the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders, the Speaker and the staff of Parliament will make it up as they go along.  Nonetheless the process would need at least several days to complete bearing in mind that: An impeachment motion, like all motions, requires at least a day\u2019s notice to be given before it is debated [perhaps Parliament would waive this requirement].\nDetailed grounds of impeachment would have to be prepared.\nA joint sitting would have to be arranged\nAn investigation committee would have to be appointed.\nThe committee would have to investigate the grounds of impeachment and give the President an opportunity to state his case [and the President would have no incentive to be brief] and to prepare a report to Parliament.\nAnother the joint session would have to be convened to consider and vote on the committee\u2019s report.\nResult of Impeachment If President Mugabe leaves office through impeachment, a Vice-President takes over as Acting President [paragraph 14(4) of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution].  All the Ministers who were appointed by him will stay in office, and so will the one remaining Vice-President, Mr Mphoko.  The fact that he may be outside the country, or in detention, or stripped of his party position and membership does not alter his status as Vice-President.  If Vice-President Mphoko were to resign then there would be no Vice-President, and only a President can appoint another Vice-President. If there were no Vice-President to act as President, the remaining Cabinet Ministers would have to appoint one of themselves as Acting President in terms of section 100(1)(c) of the Constitution.  Such an Acting President could appoint a Vice-President, but only with the approval of a majority of the Cabinet. A much simpler option would be if Mr Mugabe were to retire and appoint a new Vice-President before doing so. \u2013 Veritas"], [23234, "2017-11-20T05:31:04Z", [0.88, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.1], "Reducing confidence following along the lines of @Raisinville 's reasoning.

This meeting, which was facilitated by a mediating team led by Father Fidelis Mukonori, SJ, of the Catholic Church, followed an operation mounted by the Zimbabwe Defense Forces in the week that has gone by and which as triggered by concerns arising from the reaching of the state of affairs in our country and in the ruling ZANU-PF party.  \u201cWhatever the pros and cons of the way they went about registering those concerns, I as the President of Zimbabwe and as their commander in chief do acknowledge the issues they have drawn my attention to and do believe that these were raised in the spirit of honesty and out of deep and patriotic concern for the stability of our nation and for the welfare of our people.  \u201cAs I address you, I\u2019m also aware of a whole range of concerns, which has come from you all as  citizens of our great country and who thus deserve our untrammeled attention. Todays\u2019 meeting with the command element has underscored the need for us to collecterivly\u2014 collectively start processes that return our nation to normalcy, so all our people can go about their business unhindered in an environment of perfect peace and security assured that law and order obtain and prevail as before and endure well into the future.  \u201cIf there is any one observation we have made and drawn from events of the past week, it is the unshakable pedestal upon which rests our state of peace, law and order, amply indicating that as Zimbabweans we are generally a peaceably disposed people and with a givenness to expressing our grievances and to resolving our differences by ourselves and with a level of dignity, discipline, and restraint so rare to many other nations. This is to be admired. Indeed such traits must form the pith of our national character and personality\u2014yes, a veritable resource [which someone?] may draw upon in times of vicissitudes.  \u201cThe operation I have alluded to did not amount to a threat to our well cherished constitutional order, nor was it a challenge to my authority as head of state in government, not even as commander and chief of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces. To the man, the command element remained respectful and comported with the dictates and mores of constitutionalism. True, a few incidents may have occurred here and there, but these are being corrected. I\u2019m happy that throughout the short period, the pillars of state remained functional. Even happier for me in arising from today\u2019s meeting is a strong sense of collegiality and comradeship now binding the various arms of our security establishment. This should redound to greater peace and offer an abiding sense of security in communities and in our entire nation.  \u201cAmong the issues discussed is that relating to our economy which as we all know is going through a difficult patch. Our great concern to that guide the operations of all its organs. Of greater concern\u2026 may I read this again, I beg your pardon. Of greater concern to our commanders are the well-founded fears that the lack of unity and commonness of purpose in both party and government was translating into perceptions of inattentiveness to the economy.  \u201cOpen public spats between high-ranking officials in the party and government exacerbated by multiple conflicting messages from both the party and government made the criticisms leveled against us inescapable. Amidst all this, flagship projects already adopted by government stood stalled or mired in needless controversies. All this now has to stop as we inaugurate a new work culture and pace which will show a strong sense of purpose and commitment to turning around our economy in terms of our policies. Zemasit (ph?) government remains committed to improving the social and material conditions\u2026 material conditions of the people. \u201cGovernment will soon unveil an entrepreneurial skills and business development program which will empower and unleash gainful projects at our growth points and rural areas. Fellow Zimbabweans we are a nation born out of a protracted struggle for national independence. Our roots lie in that epochal struggle whose goals and ideals must guide our present and structure our future. The tradition of resistance is our collective legacy whose core tenets must be subscribed by all across generations and across times. Indeed this, too, was a great concern for our commanders, who themselves were makers of that revolution and often at very tender ages and at great personal peril.  \u201cWe still have in our various communities veterans of that founding struggle who might\u2019ve found the prevailing management of national and [party?] issues quite alienating. This must be corrected without delay, including ensuring that these veterans continue to play central roles in the lives of our nation. We must all recognize that their participation in the war of liberation exacted lifelong costs, which whilst hardly repayable may still be assuaged and ameliorated.  \u201cIn respect of the party and in the party issues raised by the commanders and by the general membership of ZANU-PF, there, too stand acknowledged\u2026 these, too stand acknowledged. They have to be attended to with a great sense of [agency/urgency]. However, I\u2019m aware that as a party of liberation, ZANU-PF has over the years written elaborate rules and procedures that guide the operations of all its organs and personnel. Indeed the current criticism raised \u2014 raised against the command element b\u2014 raised against it by the command element and some of its members have a reason from a well founded perception that the party was stretching or even failing in its own rules and procedures.  \u201cThe way forward, thus cannot be based on swapping, vying cliques that ride roughshod over party rules and procedures. There has to be a net [perhaps he meant new?] return to the guiding principles of our party as enshrined in our constitution, which must apply fairly and equitably in all situations and before all members. The era of victimization and arbitrary decisions must be put behind. As so as\u2026 we all embrace a new ethos predicated on the supreme law of our party and nourished by an abiding sense of comradely.  \u201cTo all this, must be general recognition that ZANU-PF\u2014ZANU-PF is a party of traditions and has been served by successive generations who are bound together by shared ideals and values which must continue to reign supreme in our nation. Hence, of intergenerational conflict must be resolved through harmonized melding of old established players as they embrace and welcome new rules. New ones through a well defined sense of hierarchy and succession. Indeed all these matters will be discussed and settled at the forthcoming congress within the framework of a clear roadmap that seeks to resolve once and for all any omissions or contradictions that have affected our party negatively.  \u201cThe Congress is due in a few weeks from now. I\u2019ll preside over its processes which must not be prepossessed by any acts calculated to undermine it or to compromise the outcomes in the eyes of the public. As I conclude this address I am aware that many developments have occurred in the party or have been championed and done by individuals in the name of the party. Given the failings of the past and the anger these might have triggered in some quarters, such as developments \u2014 such developments are quite understandable. However we cannot be guided by bitterness or vengefulness, both of which would not make us any better party members or any better Zimbabweans. \u201cOur hallowed policy of reconciliation, which we announced in 1980 and through which we reached out to those who had occupied and oppressed us for nearly a century and those we had traded fire with in a bitter war surely cannot be unavailable to our own both in the party and in our nation. We must learn to forgive and resolve contradictions real or perceived in a comradely Zimbabwean spirit. I am confident that from tonight, our whole nation at all levels gets refocused at all levels as we put shoulder to the wheel amidst the promising agricultural season already upon us. Let us all move forward reminding ourselves of our wartime mantra: [words in another language: \u201cUwenene Tinehbassa\u201d (ph.)]. I thank you, and goodnight.

I don't see what the plan-B is for Mugabe's captors if the man doesn't voluntarily step down, so I think things could remain in limbo for a while. Furthermore, I don't see what the hurry is to replace Mugabe from Mnangagwa's perspective if Grace Mugabe is gone; from the military's perspective there could be a world in which they might even prefer the veneer of constitutionality afforded by keeping Mugabe in power until Mnangagwa runs in his stead in the elections next year. Mugabe said something like he'd step down if there was a party vote; I dunno how difficult it is for the military to pressure everyone necessary in the party (or how many people that is) but that route is probably very difficult and messy. At any rate, there appears to be more urgency to see Mugabe replaced than my above assessment of incentives (even discounting for the media's desire for news to report on), so I must be missing something: I fully realize when trying to weigh all this that I lack the strategic acumen to've come nearly as far as ZDF/Mnangagwa in reaching this point.

Firstly, we wish to assure the nation that his Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defense Forces, Comrade R.G.

We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice.

We are against that act of injustice and we intend to protect every one of you against that. To the Judiciary:\nThe measures underway are intended to ensure that as an independent arm of the state you are able to exercise your independent authority as has been obstructed by this group of individuals.  To our Members of Parliament:\nYour legislative role is of paramount importance for peace and stability in this country and it is our desire that a dispensation is created that allows you to serve your respective political constituencies according to democratic tenants. To the generality of the people of Zimbabwe:\nWe urge you to remain calm and limit unnecessary movement.

Moyo seems to say the Zimbabwe Defense Forces have got a perceived \"criminal\" threat they want to take care of but that Mugabe and his family are ok (which might rule out the military's targeting Grace with any violence). (edit: I now assume SK Moyo, information officer of Zanu-PF (not to be confused with General SB Moyo) is one of the perceived \"criminal\" elements; he signed a statement accusing a high-ranking member of the military of treason after the military official suggested it could intervene to stop \"purges\" in the wake of Mnagagwa's ouster.) General SB Moyo alluded to some sort of threat to the judiciary. Anyone aware of anybody in Zimbabwe going after the judiciary recently and any interest the military might have in such a situation? Also signaled to the legislature wants them to have funds. Called on veterans to maintain order and cancelled all leave for active duty military; said report to barracks. Political leadership are to encourage their people to be non-violent. He encouraged people to remain indoors unless they have jobs in which case they should go to work. i don't think the phrase \"keep calm and carry on\" was said all it once, but maybe all those words were used. Said the ZDF just wants to return to normalcy. Hm... Still unclear to me from the video who the military's targets are, and what its objectives are. My wild guess is the military wants to return Mnangagwa to his previous level of power/stature/rank with possible interest promotion within the party to run in the election next year instead of Mugabe and they think they can make this happen in a peaceful way with at least a pretense of democratic process? (Grace, ostensibly promoted to #2 position, ousting Mnagagwa, has been getting booed in the streets recently (she responded by accusing her hecklers of being paid off). Perhaps (here i'm probably reading too much into Gen. Moyo's reference to the judiciary) the military also wants someone on trial soon for something, perhaps for role in Mnangagwa's expulsion and/or denial of military access to media organs re Mnangawa, but I doubt that someone is Robert Mugabe himself."], [68, "2017-11-15T03:43:50Z", [0.34, 0.0, 0.0, 0.33, 0.33], "The Army appears to be taking over in Zimbabwe, though so far they claim it's not a coup, just targeted action against criminals!

Zimbabwe media relies more on opinion than information and the international press is no better informed. Some of this is due to partisanship, but it's also clear that there is a dearth of reliable information to draw from. What isn't clear is whether this is a result of deliberate obfuscation from those near to Mugabe, or whether it's because no-one actually has a clue what's going on.\n2. There's plenty of scuttlebutt suggesting Grace is next in line, but this would surely be a disastrous decision. Would it be seen as a dynastic succession? If so, it's more likely to galvanize opponents than unite the party and the nation. The problem, however, is that no-one from the inner circle may be able to bring all the factions together. The threat of a coup will be real for some time.\n3. Mugabe may be quite mad. At the very least, he is blind to the needs of his people. As he currently spends more time abroad than at home it is hard to know if he is much more than president in-name-only. With this in mind, I don't think it's too silly to wonder if the line about Mugabe being \"president for life\" is more than just talk. If old Bob completely loses his marbles or falls into a coma, will he still officially be president?\nHow might GJO score this question if a) someone is appointed acting president or b) the new president is overthrown within a few weeks?"], [26288, "2016-11-14T22:47:26Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.35, 0.05, 0.35], ""], [26288, "2016-11-14T22:46:43Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.4], ""], [26288, "2016-11-14T22:43:10Z", [0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.05, 0.4], ""], [368, "2016-11-14T21:40:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [691, "2016-11-14T20:01:03Z", [0.18, 0.14, 0.4, 0.02, 0.26], ""], [368, "2016-11-13T21:31:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [10759, "2016-11-13T19:55:35Z", [0.26, 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.52], ""], [4634, "2016-11-13T19:54:53Z", [0.26, 0.02, 0.05, 0.15, 0.52], ""], [28414, "2016-11-13T19:28:26Z", [0.27, 0.06, 0.07, 0.51, 0.09], "http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21709954-broke-and-divided-zimbabwes-government-preparing-mugabexit-life-after-bob"], [691, "2016-11-13T16:22:24Z", [0.18, 0.14, 0.4, 0.02, 0.26], ""], [368, "2016-11-12T21:52:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [691, "2016-11-12T19:59:53Z", [0.18, 0.14, 0.4, 0.02, 0.26], ""], [30194, "2016-11-12T15:54:24Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.03, 0.25, 0.65], ""], [27970, "2016-11-12T12:28:32Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.35, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [28414, "2016-11-12T00:12:07Z", [0.25, 0.03, 0.12, 0.4, 0.2], ""], [368, "2016-11-11T19:54:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [30178, "2016-11-11T18:30:20Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.25], "He's very old.

The only options for another person stepping into the job would be 1) his demise and 2) a successful, extraconstitutional attempt to change the government. Thanks to @Khalid for taking care of option 1 (http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/329141). I will assume a 20% chance of him dying (instead of a 22% chance as the data suggests), given that as a head of state with essentially unlimited money he can buy the best health care available on the planet. The chance of him becoming \"unfit\" is of course greater, but his entourage would likely resist (successfully) any attempt to remove him from office, even if he should be completely incapacitated. As of option 2, Mugabe has pretty good control of the security forces and they have little to gain from deposing him. Military and police have demonstrated in the past that they are willing and able to suppress any challenge to the government violently, so without support from these sectors of society, the opposition won't be able to bring about regime change. There is a very small residual chance of a succesful insurrection against an entrenched regime within a year's span, which I put at 2% in the case of Zimbabwe. That puts the \"No\" option at a probability of 78% (the inverse of the probability of Mugabe dying minus 2). This is subject to change should we get reliable information on a serious health issue affecting Mugabe, or signs of flagging loyalty within the security forces. \"Someone else\" would essentially be someone who steps in after a successful popular insurrection/palace coup, or after Mugabe's death who is not named in any of the other options. I give this a blanket 5% probability, given the large number of possible candidates and the uncertainty revolving around these types of events. Grace Mugabe, while having strengthened her position in recent years, is in my eyes no serious contender. The power in Zimbabwe lies with the military and Grace is a latecomer to the political game with few allies in the security establishment. Even if Robert Mugabe designates her his successor (which he hasn't, so far), this is unlikely to impress the generals and their allies. I give her a 2% chance. Of the remaining two candidates, Mnangagwa has seniority and he is a former intelligence chief. Never bet against the former spy.

As predicted  several years before the US organized the coup in Ukraine, when for me it became clear that US administration is confronting Russia, I have warned my friends in APAC that cornering Russia may endanger the safety of Israel, but surely will dramatically weaken the influence of the USA in the world. Now we see that happening, not because the oligarchs in Washington have overestimated the might of USA, but because they have underestimated the might of Russia. Obama said that Russia is just a regional power. He erred, as in many other things. I would formulate it differently: USA is a superpower, but only if it respects Russia's national interests.

What we\u2019ve seen in the past few weeks, we haven\u2019t seen for a long time.\u201d 2.  Zimbabwe is facing its worst political and economic crisis since 2008. The economy is in ruins. The ruling party is split into feuding factions. The biggest protests in years have erupted in the streets. The government is so bankrupt that it has to delay its salary payments to its bloated civil service, which consumes a staggering 97 per cent of state revenue. And Mr. Mugabe himself is ailing, often mysteriously jetting off to Asia for medical treatment, while the political elite squabble over the right to succeed him. 3. But his declining health is visible to everyone. A veteran Zimbabwean journalist, Peta Thornycroft, described how Mr. Mugabe spoke \u201cpainfully slowly\u201d at a recent rally of his party\u2019s youth league in Harare. He delivered much of his speech \u201cwith his eyes closed,\u201d she reported. It is difficult to imagine how Mr. Mugabe could campaign again in 2018, the journalist said. He \u201ccannot move about freely,\u201d she noted. \u201cHe is uncertain on his feet, and he speaks ever more slowly.\u201d 4.THE COLLAPSING ECONOMY Millions of Zimbabweans have already fled into exile, seeking jobs in South Africa or Western countries. The unemployment rate remains close to 90 per cent, most industries have shut down, the once-lucrative diamond-mining sector has nearly run out of diamonds and cash shortages have led to lengthy queues at banks. The latest drought has left about four million people (30 per cent of the population) dependent on food aid. 5.THE BANKRUPT GOVERNMENT In a budget speech this month, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa stunned the nation by admitting that 97 per cent of government revenue was consumed by government wages. He called it \u201cuntenable\u201d and warned that the government might be unable to meet its payroll obligations in the future. 6. FACTIONAL FEUDING As it becomes increasingly obvious that Mr. Mugabe\u2019s health is failing and he might be unable to rule the country much longer, his ruling ZANU-PF party has been riddled with infighting. \u201cThe state of the party has never been so fractured,\u201d said Piers Pigou, a political analyst who wrote a report on Zimbabwe for the Africa-based Institute for Security Studies. \u201cConvulsions within the ruling party have intensified to unprecedented levels,\u201d said another analyst, Zimbabwean scholar Brian Raftopoulos.\nhttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/the-mounting-challenges-facing-zimbabwes-long-time-ruler-robert-mugabe/article31963666/"], [19801, "2016-09-21T13:14:26Z", [0.44, 0.15, 0.06, 0.35, 0.0], "92 years old, no way he will make 93.\nhttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/losing-robert-mugabe-zimbabwes-92-year-old-leader-disappears-after-new-delhi-no-show-1549020\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/13/africa/zimbabwe-protests-robert-mugabe-rebellion/ What an absolutely terrible list of contenders, I can only hope people power will produce a decent candidate instead of this rollcall of dumb, dumber and even more corrupt."], [68, "2016-09-21T11:58:02Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.6], "Revising \"NO\" down from 75 on recalculation of actuarial odds for 17 months from today for a person 92 yrs 7 months old.
