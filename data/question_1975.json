It is likely that given the low recent incidence figures (~20/100k population), lots of travel within Germany (mainly North to South, West to North) will spill over the current pockets of Delta/B.1.617.2 which are situated in Northrhine-Westfalia and Bavaria, throughout the country in a matter of week. UEFA 2020 Euro Championships will bring in additional international travel, even though only Munich (Bavaria) serves as a host city. However, Hessia, with FRA as one of Europe's busiest airports, has found an above-average number of Delta, and the pick-up in international travel for summer holidays along with travel to and from sporting events, appear to be a unhealthy cocktail. Delta has even arrived in Berlin and some counties on Berlin's fringes and some other East German cities such as Dresden (Saxony). Watching football matches in crowded bars (even if largely outdoors), among neighbors and friends could prove to be prone to fresh outbreaks. In all, it seems set that the share of Delta will follow the pattern of the UK (where Delta has become the \"dominant strain\" already) and increase even in Germany to more than 10% of all cases by end of June.\nGiven the recently slow progress in vaccinations amid repeated scarcity of vials, a \"summer effect\" (reduced viral lifetime of ~20%) that cannot compensate for Delta's higher r0 and people partying in the streets like it's 2019 and being more careless amid fast reopenings, I'm increasingly worried that Germany's fourth wave of SARS-CoV-2 is going to arrive sooner than expected: Germany may have 10k+ cases per day in July already. With incoming tourist from the EU, Berlin may indeed prove to be at the center of the problem. A long story cut short, here's what the Humboldt Forum organizers say:\n\"Ausblick Sofern sich die Pandemie-Lage weiterhin stabilisiert, werden im Juli die Ausstellungen im Erdgeschoss und 1. Obergeschoss (Geschichte des Ortes, Einblicke. Die Br\u00fcder Humboldt, schrecklich sch\u00f6n. Elefant \u2013 Mensch \u2013 Elfenbein, Nimm Platz! Eine Ausstellung f\u00fcr Kinder, Nach der Natur und BERLIN GLOBAL) \u00f6ffnen. Im Sp\u00e4tsommer 2021 folgen der Westfl\u00fcgel der zweiten und dritten Etage mit dem Ethnologischen und Asiatischen Museum sowie die Dachterrasse. In der ersten Jahresh\u00e4lfte 2022 schlie\u00dflich steht den Besucher*innen das gesamte Haus offen.\"\nhttps://www.humboldtforum.org/de/besuch-vor-ort/ (No official translation under https://www.humboldtforum.org/en/on-location/ , but it says \"Under the assumption that the pandemic situation continues to stabilize, exhibitions in the basement and on the 2nd floor (Geschichte des Ortes, Einblicke.

Eine Ausstellung f\u00fcr Kinder, Nach der Natur und BERLIN GLOBAL) will open in July.\" My assumption is they are going to use June/July's deteriorating situation and the scary outlook for August to postpone the opening into fall (when everybody has been able to get vaccinated and exhibitions (and the city as a whole) will be less crowded by tourists), while the real reason behind may be the mounting pressure from deadlines to trouble-shoot the shortcomings of the building. Their own wording is more cautious and less optimistic than what was purported by the media. Finally, the strange news about the Humboldt Foundation's treatment of staff may make it harder for them to fill vacancies. For example, the foundation is still hiring an \"IT-Enterprise Architekt*in (m/w/d)\" (closing date 25 June 2021, https://www.humboldtforum.org/de/jobs/ ), whose likely task it is to streamline the purportedly fragmented and unsafe software environment which appears to cause a lion share of the trouble within the building (lighting, electricity, dysfunctional doors, box offices, air conditioning,...).\nIf they do find and hire key staff by the end of June, I only wonder just how much a single person can improve a system in a matter of two to four weeks that has been corrupted by dozens of contractors over several months..."], [96450, "2021-06-10T11:17:38Z", [0.92], ""], [80790, "2021-06-09T18:36:00Z", [0.55], "https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-palace-opens-its-gates/a-57822667 Article says there is a mid July planned open date.

For cases with a higher actual figure, there is no advice given in the recommendation, since then other aspects and considerations such as the situation the hospitals' ICUs would be crucial.\nhttps://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/bundesregierung/staatsministerin-fuer-kultur-und-medien/aktuelles/experten-legen-eckpunkte-zur-wiederoeffnung-von-theatern-kinos-und-bibliotheken-vor-kulturstaatsministerin-gruetters-verantwortungsvoller-neustart-ist-moeglich--1872466\nhttps://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/421/dokumente/moriske_et._al._eckpunkte_zur_durchfuehrung_von_kulturveranstaltungen_-_theater_konzerthaeuser_kinos_-_unter_pandemiebedingungen_3.3.2021.pdf\nAlthough museums and libraries are considered slightly less problematic with regards to aerosols due to dynamics/movements in restricted visitors numbers, problems could still arise from crowded situation and groupings of people. Berlin, similar to Germany as a whole (currently at ~110), has a value of 130 cases per 7 days per 100k inhabitants, and this with the expectation of lower than actual figures due to disruptions in testing and reporting during holidays.\nLast time Germany was in a similar situation at the beginning of the second wave was around 15 October 2020, and it took three months until 15 January 2021 after a peak around Christmas that Germany has reduced the average figure back to the initial level. This time, with more knowledge about Variants of Concern and their potential effect on infection chains, it will likely take even longer to get near the value of 50, which results in mid-July 2021. Thus what determines the perspectives for openings of museums most will be the situation in high care units of hospitals, for which there exists a nationwide database that delivers an overview about occupied and spare capacities, hosted by the medical association called DIVI e.V.\nhttps://www.divi.de/\nhttps://www.divi.de/register/tagesreport Two of the most influential voices of the medical community have issued a call for immediate action and for emergency measures in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed in the first week of May.\nProjections show that even under the optimistic scenario for vaccinations the society will likely have to accept a stricter lockdown than ever before, and the longer it takes for decision-makers to come to the same conclusion, the tougher the measures will have to be and the longer it will take until hospitals will return to normal conditions again, on average by 01 July 2021.\nhttps://twitter.com/ECMOKaragianni1/status/1379754846702743553 (head of DIVI e.V.)\nhttps://twitter.com/c_drosten/status/1380058204927885314 (advisor to the federal government) Even if all things go well and hospitals in Germany experience a mild, managable scenario, a trade-off will remain between inevitable mobility and contacts (schools, essential economic activity) and non-essential sectors such as museums.\nI thus assume that the beginning of holidays could be prove crucial for other sectors to open during summer vacation. For Berlin, this would mean 24 June 2021 as of now, but then again I'm not sure these dates won't be subject to change this year.\nTeachers (about 1mn employees) will have to be fully vaccinated first, before school opening really is more or less safe, and vacations may this year be coordinated with lock downs, but this is rather speculative.\nIn any case and in any scenario, it's fairly certain that the education sector will have a higher priority than museums until immunization through the vaccination program nears herd immunity.

The Robert-Koch-Institut recently submitted a recommendation to the BMG to regard vaccinated persons as if they have a valid new negative test, which would entail some easing of restrictions. However, this recommendation is not based on proper research but on anecdotical evidence only that suggests that asymptomatic persons are less likely to transmit the virus if vaccinated than with a negative rapid antigen test, and this may prove to be a premature or false conclusion with regards to safety, since this kind of test on average has a false negativity rate of 42%.

The caveat being that Germany is currently experiencing a third wave of the covid pandemic, due in a part to the EU procurement process and roll out of the vaccination program and could prove to be worse than the previous two. Another issue is the political correctness of the museum in that it contains and will exhibit items and artifacts from a colonial age and may attract criticism from various parties.\nIndeed, the museum has entered into discussions to return Benin Bronzes back to Nigeria after letters of complaint from the Nigerian ambassador. The museum building is located close to the residence of King Wilhelm 1 where he and Bismark endeavoured to catch up with other European leaders in the race to profit from Africa\u2019s natural resources, slaves and artistry. Reports have indicated a rethink of how history may be presented.\nThere has been widespread criticism over the museum housing nearly 20,000 artefacts from Africa, Asia and Oceania, mostly former colonies.\nThis could perhaps cause a pause or disruption in a full opening. However, a digital opening to a restricted audience is possible prior to 1st August 2021 and should hold complaints to a minimum. https://www.berlin.de/corona/en/measures/  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1100823/coronavirus-cases-development-germany/  https://www.deutschland.de/en/news/german-federal-government-informs-about-the-corona-crisis  https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/23/germany-extends-lockdown-until-mid-april-amid-third-wave-of-infections  https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210321-several-german-states-seek-to-extend-restrictions-amid-third-wave-of-covid-19  https://www.dw.com/en/covid-germanys-3rd-wave-could-be-worse-than-last-2/a-57010811  https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/germany-humboldt-forum-stirs-colonial-controversy  https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-museum-stirs-debate-with-plans-for-colonial-era-remembrance-room/a-47282724  http://www.carmah.berlin/reflections/present-imperfect-future-intense/  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55335918\nhttps://news.artnet.com/art-world/restitution-benin-bronzes-humboldt-forum-1953883\nhttps://www.de24.news/en/2020/11/due-to-the-corona-the-humboldt-forum-will-initially-only-open-digitally.html  https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/what-exactly-is-the-humboldt-forum  https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/arts/design/humboldt-forum-berlin.html\n"], [48709, "2021-04-04T09:19:29Z", [0.0], "Not until 2022"], [92079, "2021-04-04T01:47:29Z", [1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-04-04T01:45:59Z", [0.0], ""], [58028, "2021-04-03T22:51:57Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2021-04-03T18:31:36Z", [0.52], ""], [100184, "2021-04-03T18:25:17Z", [0.75], ""], [38094, "2021-04-03T15:18:33Z", [0.0], "Following the excellent explanation offered by @SE_Meyer, and the current state of the pandemic and the lackluster vaccination campaign I'll say NO until either of those situations improve."], [97185, "2021-04-03T14:55:30Z", [0.03], "As per @SE_Meyer, https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1258493 , there are symbolic reasons to choose a later date."], [99964, "2021-04-03T14:11:28Z", [0.75], "I assume them opening to vaccinated participants."], [97375, "2021-04-03T10:02:47Z", [0.68], ""], [18679, "2021-04-03T09:58:08Z", [0.9], ""], [41352, "2021-04-03T06:15:44Z", [0.35], ""], [88452, "2021-04-03T04:46:26Z", [0.0], "This question is rather complex, like the historic grounds the Humboldt Forum is buildt upon are overly complex, too. On the surface, the regulation is very easy:\nThe Humboldt Forum is characterized as a \"cosmopolitan forum for culture, art and science\", but first and foremost it is supposed to host the vast collections of several museums in and around Berlin, and a museum with exhibitions of pieces of these collections. It is meant to form an emsemble together with a few more reknowned, important museums on the \"Museumsinsel\" in the historic city center of Berlin: \nAltes Museum (Old Museum), Neues Museum (New Museum), Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery), Bode Museum, Pergamon Museum and finally the newly reconstruced city castle-shaped Humbolt Forum, which together as a whole \"was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites\" in 1999. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island\nThe name, by the way, refers to the Humboldt brothers, who were important advisers to the kings of Prussia in the late 18th and early 19th century and, being researchers themselves, laid the foundation of the Prussian and later German higher education system with a focus on humanism as it is known today.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt As a museum located in Berlin (irrespective of ownership or users), disease prevention in Berlin is under the rule of the city (and land) Berlin, which currently states:\n\"Nach ersten \u00d6ffnungen Mitte des Monats lassen die Staatliche Museen in Berlin die T\u00fcren weiterer H\u00e4user geschlossen.\nZun\u00e4chst sollen die neuen Regelungen mit obligatorischen Corona-Tests in den bereits ge\u00f6ffneten Museen getestet werden, hie\u00df es am Mittwoch (31. M\u00e4rz 2021) zur Begr\u00fcndung. \nErste Museen bereits ge\u00f6ffnet\nIm ersten Schritt waren neben dem Neuen Museum mit der ber\u00fchmten Nofretete die Alte Nationalgalerie, die James-Simon-Galerie, das Pergamonmuseum und das Panorama auf der Museumsinsel Berlin sowie das Museum Europ\u00e4ischer Kulturen in Dahlem ge\u00f6ffnet worden. Weitere H\u00e4user sollten eigentlich an diesem Donnerstag folgen. Das ist nun ausgesetzt.\nGro\u00dfes Interesse an Museumsbesuchen: 30 000 Tickets in zwei Wochen verkauft\nDie bereits ge\u00f6ffneten Museen sollen zun\u00e4chst bis zum 7. April besucht werden k\u00f6nnen. Bis dahin werde \u00fcber weitere Schritte entschieden, sagte ein Sprecher der dpa in Berlin. Das Interesse ist gro\u00df. In den zwei Wochen seit \u00d6ffnung der ersten H\u00e4user wurden den Angaben zufolge rund 30 000 Tickets verkauft.\"\nhttps://www.berlin.de/ausstellungen/nachrichten/6492485-3041403-staatliche-museen-in-berlin-verschieben-.html\nAmid the infection rates in Germany and in Berlin, the scheduled reopening after 16 March 2021 has been halted on 31 March and re-defined as a \"trial\" for visits to museums and other public spaces under strict testing regimes, which will now end on 07 April for the time being. In general, Berlin's \"Infektionsschutzverordnung\" (infection protection act) is due to run out on 18 April 2021, and will likely be renewed and prolonged for four more weeks in a \"Conference of decision makers\" of Bund and laender in the week before 10-17 April 2021, despite some criticism of this format and its outcomes. As a host to the federal government and with its nearly 3.5mn inhabitants, (the city and land) Berlin is of great importance and has a signalling function within the country. It is also a hotspot for international tourism and rather densely populated, so that disease control is a rather difficult task in Berlin, and rules are supposed to be rather strict in the near future.\nFrom this perspective, an opening to the general public is rather unlikely before end of May 2021. For the months of June and July 2021, a seasonal effect could suppress the virus somewhat, so that there will be a permanent pressure in the public opinion for more \"freedoms\", and museums will argue for opening to the public with their budget, the loss in revenue and the fact that alternative routes for infections, such as international travel within the EU, are still allowed. However, being situated very close to Poland and rather close to Czechia, two countries in which the pandemic is mostly out of control due to mutant viruses, and with respect to frequent work commuting between the countries, mostly into Germany's eastern part due to the relatively higher wages, the pandemic and possibly future Variants of Concern (VoC) will be imported to Brandenburg (the land that surrounds Berlin) and Berlin very early and despite all testing efforts at the border. Museums and other cultural sites have a hard time to find a critical argument for why an opening now is \"necessary\", and the Humboldt Forum and e.g. the Louvre in Paris have brought up digital exhibition concepts in order to keep their relevance. In a situation, in which person-to-person contacts and mobility \"in sum\" pose a problem, in-person experience and visits of museum exhibitions are likely on the upper fringe of what the society can abstain from for a while. There are currently nine exhibitions on schedule for \"Spring 2021\", but this schedule may only be indicative at this point and subject to changes, as the pandemic proceeds, at the moment the Humboldt Forum and all others of the \"Staatliche Museen zu Berlin\" (15 in total) will remain closed after the \"trial\" ends on 07 April for the foreseeable future and \"until further notice\". Right next to the Humboldt Forum the memorial \"Denkmal f\u00fcr Freiheit und Einheit\" is now under construction, and it already missed the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall for a scheduled inauguration due to a host of delays and issues. Possible symbolic dates for an inauguration would be 03 October 2021 or 09 November 2021, if construction is to be finished by then. I can imagine that, due to a symbolic value the city castle has as well (from the balcony of the historic city castle, the first German republic, the \"Weimar republic\", and thus democracy, was proclaimed in 1918), there will be a wish by politicians, local and federal, of all parties, to release the Humboldt Forum from the pressure to open to the public soon, and to open both of the sites together and hand them to the public in one large symbolic act on one of the dates in autumn 2021. Everything else could look smallish and inappropriate amid the cost of currently 682mn EUR for the Humboldt Forum alone.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Freedom_and_Unity\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Schloss Just yesterday 02 April 2021, the federal government announced plans which will have to be worked out in detail to establish a financial vehicle (\"Kulturfonds\") that will reimburse cultural events (and probably even venues such as museums, imho) for foregone revenues in the future, as there is much talk with respect to the variant B.1.1.7 of a \"totally new pandemic/SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-21\" even by Chancellor Angela Merkel, which is probably an acknowledgement of the fact that the impact of mutants have been widely underestimated as late as in February 2021, when steps of reopening have been decided upon very prematurely. With 2.5bn EUR probably assigned to it, the size is significant and serves as an indication that the cultural life in public spaces will not be what it used to be (and what it is expected to be) in a long long time to come.\nhttps://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/2-5-milliarden-fuer-corona-kulturfonds.265.de.html?drn:news_id=1244395 I thus start forecasting \"No.\", but will certainly adapt to new information from the Berlin administration after 07 April 2021. EDIT: shame on me, for not checking sources first, it appears I mixed up actors and locations in the \"double proclamation of the republic\", a fancy of German history on 09 November 1918. It was actually from a window at the Reichstag (the historic and current house of the German parliament Bundestag) that Phillip Scheidemann proclaimed the \"Weimar republic\" at 2 p.m..\nhttps://www.bundesarchiv.de/DE/Content/Dokumente-zur-Zeitgeschichte/19181109_ausrufung-der-republik.html (an narrative of Scheidemann in person about the historic events)\nhttps://weimar.bundesarchiv.de/WEIMAR/DE/Content/Artikel/Entdecken/scheidemann-rede-film-audio.html (original (?) historic motion picture without tone)\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausrufung_der_Republik_in_Deutschland It was actually Karl Liebknecht who held his proclamation speech at the city castle (a legend says \"from within the castle\", a sign the old system of nobility and government of the Hohenzollern family, the emperor's family, had been overcome) and proclaimed the \"German sovjet republic\" at 4 p.m. the same day.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_republic_(system_of_government)\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ausrufung_der_Republik_in_Deutschland#Die_Proklamation_Liebknechts Being two hours earlier Scheidemann's proclamation was superior. However, his republic sadly survived 13 and a half years only. However, both sites, the Reichstag and the city castle are only half a mile of walk distance apart, and two balcony speeches at the city castle in front of huge masses were used by emperor Wilhelm II to announce Germany's preparedness to enter a war in July/August 1914, the first European catastrophe of the 20th century.\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkonreden"], [34815, "2021-04-03T03:54:35Z", [1.0], ""], [22689, "2021-04-02T23:13:08Z", [1.0], ""], [89035, "2021-04-02T22:51:20Z", [1.0], ""], [87827, "2021-04-02T21:25:32Z", [0.75], "Cases are currently rising but I would guess Germany will have most of the population who wants a vaccine vaccinated by late summer and that cases will be much lower than now.
