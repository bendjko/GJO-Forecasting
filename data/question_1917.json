Currently the federal funds rate range is low at 0%-.25%. The rate was lowered in March 2020 in response to the economic impact of Covid-19, and although the stock market rebounded quickly, unemployment remains high and inflation rates lower than you would expect in a healthy, growing economy. Because economic recovery from the pandemic is ongoing, I think the Fed will be reluctant to raise the upper limit of the federal funds rate range until we begin to see clearer signs of economic recovery. With entire economic sectors like hospitality and entertainment still struggling, I think economic recovery will remain slow until we move closer to herd immunity, which is unlikely to happen in 2021. The Fed has previously indicated an unwillingness to let the federal funds rate go negative. I think this is most likely to remain the case.
