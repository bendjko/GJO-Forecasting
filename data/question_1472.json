On the one hand oil prices are going up, and most probably will continue to do so, if OPEC acts like they just planned.\nOn the other hand, that might be too late to change, what leading experts think:\n1) ECB expects only 0.3% for the whole year (down from 1.1 in March):\nhttps://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/eurozone-ezb-erwartet-beispiellosen-konjunktureinbruch-a-48553dda-d84e-4638-bb68-e9155fbf0252 Average of 0.74 for January to May so far. For an average of 0.3 for the whole year it needs an average of around zero (a little below) for the next 7 months.

The 1% chance for \"0% or less\" is because there is clearly this possibilities, but it seems intuitively remote and previous precedence would back up that intuition. I would also say that the June average tens to be at or around the average of Jan-May, hence I would look again at the numbers at June. This would also affect the chances of the 0-1% or >2% options, as, if a crash for example hasn't happened by the end of May, it is clearly less likely to happen by the end of June, as it is likely to happen by the end of June when judged from today, at the start of January. This also fits in with the ECB's desire to keep the eurozone inflation \"below, but close to, 2%\".
