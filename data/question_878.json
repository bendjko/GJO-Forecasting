PHI has a good defense, but inconsistent play under Foles on offense. It's hard to determine if their win against ATL was more a function of their offense coming together, or the inconsistent play that has plagued ATL and Matt Ryan throughout the years. In the AFC/NFC championships, I think MIN is more likely to beat PHI than vice versa. JAX poses a formidable threat to NE, but the match up is more of NE Off vs JAX Def. NE's Def has improved throughout the season, and JAX's fate depends on which version of Bortles shows up on Sunday.

Defense wins championships.\u201d . . . .The thinking goes that while offense may be flashy and exciting, solid defensive play \u2013 less noticeable, but more steady and predictable \u2013 forms the foundation of successful teams. So is there any truth to the adage? . . . To represent a team\u2019s offensive ability, we used regular season yards gained per game; for defensive ability, we used the statistic of yards allowed per game. If defense wins championships, the teams that tend to allow the fewest yards over the course of a season should have the most playoff success. What did the numbers say? After running some regression analyses, we found that defense, indeed, does win championships. The fewer regular season yards a team allowed in the regular season, the more playoff wins they tended to have.\n. . . \nThe same analysis revealed that yards gained offensively during the season correlated similarly \u2013 nearly identically, in fact \u2013 with subsequent playoff success. It turns out we should probably amend the adage to say: \u201cReally good defense wins championships. And really good offense also wins championships.\u201d\n. . . \nIf you were to look at previous sport psychology research. . . Most studies of why athletes might either \u201cchoke\u201d or be \u201cclutch\u201d under pressure had tested fine motor skills such as field goal kicking in football and free throw shooting in basketball. On the other hand, defensive skills typically require more footwork and continuous movement, and \u2013 in the case of a defensive lineman or a linebacker in football \u2013 physical strength. For this reason, it was generally assumed that defensive play might be more stable, and less susceptible to pressure when seasons are on the line. If this were true, then the play of good defensive teams would remain steady during the playoffs, while good offensive teams would be more vulnerable to pressure-packed situations. So what might explain why our findings suggest otherwise? It may be that defensive players feel the pressure just as much as offensive players do, with their performance prone to the same fluctuations. After all, most burly defensive linemen aren\u2019t just blindly crashing into the line; rather, they\u2019re moving with the precision of a ballet dancer. At the very least, when it comes to dealing with pressure, it probably doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a cornerback or a quarterback; sport psychology research has shown that athletes who feel confident and in control are more likely to give a clutch performance. When it\u2019s all on the line, which side of the ball you\u2019re on might matter less than your ability to feel in control. . . .  Maybe we just haven\u2019t looked at football under the microscope carefully enough, and it\u2019s worth analyzing whether specific positions or actions \u2013 throwing a football, protecting the pocket, covering a wide receiver \u2013 are more vulnerable to pressure. Maybe \u201coffensive line play wins championships,\u201d or \u201cquarterbacking wins championships.\u201d\n"], [46650, "2018-01-17T19:16:30Z", [0.08, 0.28, 0.55, 0.09], ""], [37474, "2018-01-17T18:41:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [49165, "2018-01-17T18:19:18Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.15, 0.45], "..."], [745, "2018-01-17T18:14:48Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.55, 0.15], "I see New England as 80% likely to win against Jacksonville and 70% likely to win against either Minnesota or Philadelphia.
