There must be then, in the mind of the tyrannical planners, a future for ISIS. An astute strategic observer would note a couple of things about these human-guided munitions. First, they are fairly elaborate, with each requiring some number of manhours and some specific materials to complete. Secondly, they are offensive. These two items should tell you much about how the entire Iraq campaign has been conducted. ISIS has, from the very beginning, been *allowed* the luxury of time and isolation to conduct their activities. Beside the odd harassing bombardment here-or-there, there has never been, and there is still not now, the application of continual non-stop pressure, which is required to *rapidly* bring an enemy to capitulation. A human-guided munition would be of little value if the target had already swept past the marshaling point. In a sense then, it is the pace of the campaign which provides to ISIS the opportunity to use these devices.

In mid-October, the elite Iraqi unit (called \u201cthe Golden Brigade,\u201d but now referred to by Iraqis as \u201cthe Golden Division\u201d), was designated as the lead unit in the fight to retake ISIS-held Mosul (para. 1-2).

New U.S. estimates put the number of IS \"battle ready\" fighters in Iraq and Syria at just 12,000 to 15,000, less than half of what the terror group was able to field at its height. The latest intelligence puts the number of IS fighters \"at the lowest point it's ever been,\" U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Brett McGurk told White House reporters Tuesday, adding the terror group \"is unable to replenish its ranks.\"\nPrevious U.S. military and intelligence estimates, long considered by many experts to have been overly conservative, had put the size of the IS force at as many as 33,000. And bolstered by a steady influx of foreign fighters, for a time the group was able to replace fighters at the rate they were being killed (para. 1-4).\nDespite having lost about 61 percent of the territory it once possessed in Iraq, IS still controls \"huge swaths\" of land, a U.S. official told VOA on condition of anonymity (para. 11).\nAnd even the ground campaign to retake the IS stronghold of Mosul has slowed as Iraqi forces have edged closer to the city center, encountering fierce resistance. \"By our calculations, we think we have killed or badly wounded over 2,000 [IS fighters],\" the commander of Combined Joint Task Force Inherent Resolve, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, said earlier this week in Iraq. But Iraqi forces have also taken heavy casualties, and Townsend admitted as many as 5,000 IS fighters remain in Mosul, roughly the same number thought to have been left to defend the city as the Iraqi-led operation got underway two months ago (para. 11-14).

The battles for Fallujah, Bayji, Manbij, and others point to a very long siege in Mosul.  However, I am keeping this above zero because, in the general randomness, unpredictability, fog, and friction of war, there is a chance for ISIS to make a sudden tactical withdrawal, or a collapse of their chain-of-command inside Mosul.  I keep going back to Tal Abyad as my example on that for an example of a tactical withdrawal.   There were some signs that pointed to the collapse scenario in late October and early November, but I may have put too much weight no them.  It is also important to keep in mind that the campaign's wear on the men and equipment slows any advance, especially for the Iraqis, who have shown repeated shortfalls in military institutions that make modern warfighting, especially sustained combat operations, possible.   The Iraqi army is following a pattern of all Arab militaries in how is it adapting to modern warfare.  Ken Pollack's Arabs at War is probably the best single source on the topic.  To make up for their institutional shortfalls (from education, organizational culture, politicization, etc), they have created elite units, which become the only units that conduct offensive operations.  The second tier of units only conduct defensive operations.  This is because they could only coordinate combined arms tactics by concentrating their top personnel.

This is why it doesn't work:\nOne problem is that much of this money is wasted. Billions are splurged on flashy gear like jet fighters or submarines that look impressive but may not be appropriate to the kinds of conflicts they are fighting. Such toys are also hard to maintain. And widespread theft and corruption mean that a lot of kit disappears, or is kept in the barracks (which is one reason why IS was able to nab so much in Iraq). Less priority is given to command and control, logistics and intelligence-gathering. Plans lack flexibility and are adhered to even when they don\u2019t work. That is exacerbated by the lack of authority given to junior and non-commissioned officers, the glue in most Western armies. Their deference to seniority is the norm in Arab society, but leaves small units unable to act quickly without waiting for approval.\nArab armies\u2019 problems certainly do not stem from want of money or equipment: the region\u2019s countries allocate hefty shares of GDP for their forces (see map). The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London, reckons that countries in the Middle East and north Africa make up eight of the top 15 spenders on defence when measured as a share of the national pie.\nAn even more serious weakness is that armed forces in the Arab world simply don\u2019t function as neutral, professional institutions like their Western counterparts. They are often more loyal to a ruler or an ethnic or religious community than to the state: Syria is an example of the former, Libya and Yemen, riven by tribal and regional loyalties, of the latter. Military men are big players in the economies and politics of countries such as Egypt\u2014ever more so since states have tottered after 2011. The turnover of senior officers is high since regimes fear them as potential coup-plotters.

Longer term, they said, the fight against post-Mosul IS can only succeed if the border with Syria is secured and the Shiite-led government in Baghdad addresses longtime grievances by Iraq's Sunni Arab minority that fueled support for the militants (para. 1-4).

Why, for example, would the coalition destroy all of the the bridges spanning the Tigris, which separates East from West Mosul? All of the apparent progress in East Mosul cannot now be exploited beyond the Tigris without bridging. The coalition presumably has bridging assets, but any notion of a rapid advance over the Tigris seems misplaced.

The Nizari, a small conservative sect, began assassinating political figures to grow their own movement. Over 300 years, the Nizari killed hundreds of opponents, including two Caliphs, and prominent sultans and crusaders. A thousand years later, suicide bombing became the terrorist tactic du jour. On foot or in vehicles, these willing martyrs have wreaked havoc on thousands of civilian lives. Killing civilians for political gain is an adaptation of the Nizari methodology, and societies around the world continue to be haunted by the prospect of mass-casualty suicide bombings. However \u2013 using in depth Open Source Intelligence analysis on ISIS \u2013 we can explore a subtle, but significant evolution in terrorist attacks that has taken place over the last five years \u2013 an evolution that has consequences for the counter-terrorism world. Terrorist groups (including, but not limited to, ISIS) are increasingly using the little-known concept of Inghimasi to capitalise on the instantaneous, digital culture of today. If suicide bombing was made for the television age, one might say Inghimasi operations are made for the digital age. What is an Inghimasi? The concept of Inghimasi refers to a special-forces style suicide fighter who carries both small arms and explosives. He initially uses his light weapons while wearing an explosive belt that is activated only when he runs out of ammunition or when he feels threatened or trapped. The Inghimasiun essentially act as \u2018shock troops\u2019, aiming to soften the defences of their military or civilian targets. On the battelfields of the Middle East, Inghimasi are deployed to storm enemy\u2019s strategic positions or defensive lines, softening fortified positions for second and third waves of forces. Inghimasi also cover the retreat of other troops. French media reported that in the battle of Kudilah (Iraq), 7 Inghimasi fighters set off their explosives with the purpose of covering the retreat of other fighters. Though they are sometimes used in larger numbers, most Inghimasi teams employed by ISIS appear to be relatively small. Their tactics include wearing similar clothing to that of the enemy, shaving their beards and hair if necessary \u2013 taking advantage of the chaos created and inflicting maximum amounts of damage. They are free to determine the use of weapons and explosives according to their needs on the battlefield. They also choose whether they set their explosives off or not, as long as they do not return without achieving the desired goal.\nOrigins of the Inghimasi The term Inghimasi started appearing in Arabic media from 2013; however, its use on social media originates to 2011. Arabic media reports that ISIS borrowed the concept of Inghimasi from Al-Qaeda who are largely believed to have introduced it to the Jihadi world. The term appeared with the creation of Al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian and Iraqi branch when it was used to describe its fighters in Iraq. Its use later expanded to Syria with the creation of Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, such as Jabat al-Nusra, in battles against the Syrian Army. It is used by a number of groups, most significantly ISIS, but also Jabat al-Nusra and other jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. Stemming from the Arabic verb Inghamasa (\u0627\u0646\u063a\u0645\u0633) meaning \u2018to plunge\u2019 or \u2018to become immersed\u2019, an Inghimasi agrees to a \u2018no-return\u2019 operation if the circumstances dictate so. The main goal is to plunge into enemy forces with the purpose of inflicting the highest amount of damage.

It did send a brigade to the eastern side of Mosul to help hold territory taken by the special forces there.

One can understand the reluctance of regular soldiers to dismount from armored vehicles and conduct dis-mounted Urban Clearing operations. This creates two tiers or phases of operations where Field Commanders consider the safety of troops from direct fire over the efficient and seamless combined operation clearing neighborhoods and resulting safety of pursing and exploiting the momentum of an operation. All of these sputtering - stop and start assaults lose momentum, allowing D'eash to regroup and reset ambushes in front of the assault force direction or axis of operations. This is not unlike the problem in Syria in and around Aleppo where rebels  enjoy regular respites when Syrian forces go home for the day. Russian forces are exploiting advantages, but tend to cease Close Air Support and Bombing at night except when they see strategic advantage. MY POINT - A battle of attrition is developing in Mosul that mimics Aleppo today. I think that what we are seeing is acceptance of a long war format over a limited objective - Mosul.

The U.S. deployed HIMARS rocket launchers and M777 howitzers, manned by the 101st's 2nd Brigade Combat Team and the Golf Company, 526th Brigade Support Battalion.

These reinforcements will join the CTS, and elements of the 9th Armored Division, amid an ongoing push to reach the heart of Mosul.\nOn the southern axis, the Iraqi Armed Forces seized control of Qaryat Kahar\u012bz village which now can be used as a launching pad to enter Mosul's southern neighborhoods.\nMeanwhile, the Islamic State launched a major counter-offensive west of Qayyarah in a bid to capture its airfield and cut off the Iraqi Army's supply line to Mosul. Although initially successful, capturing 6 villages, the Iraqi Army swiftly responded and recaptured all lost sites, leaving the assault thwarted, and resulting in the death and arrest of 51 fighters.\nAn Iraqi military source informs Al-Masdar News that at least 2800 ISIS fighters have been killed or captured since the campaign to liberate Mosul, dubbed operation \"We Are Coming, Nineveh\", began on October 16th.\nOn the other hand, ISIS' Amaq Agency claims 2671 Iraqi and Kurdish troops have been killed during the offensive while 124 VBIED's (suicide trucks) have struck anti-ISIS forces.\nAcross the border, in Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have advanced to within 25 kilometers of another ISIS stronghold, none other than Raqqa, the de facto Islamic State capital (para. 1-7).

Three days ago, paramilitary forces took the strategically important Tal Afar air base, which can serve as a launching point in the battle with ISIS west of Mosul. Tal Afar is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) west of Mosul.\nIzzeddin Aldola, a member of the Iraqi parliament who represent Sunnis from the Tal Afar area, told CNN by phone of fears about PMU forces entering the city.\n\"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised us that only the Iraqi army will enter Tal Afar,\" Aldola said. \"We are very worried, and even if only people from Tal Afar fight ISIS in the city, this means another civil war.\"\nOn Friday, Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization and a PMU commander, announced the Shia paramilitary group, the Sons of Tal Afar, would liberate the city (para 1-8).\nTension between Baghdad government, Kurds\nFurther complicating the Mosul offensive, the Iraqi Prime Minister has maintained that Kurdish forces must withdraw from towns captured from ISIS once the terror group has been defeated.

The civilian population of the Iraqi city is forced to either be caught in crossfire or try to flee the besieged town.\nThe operation to retake Mosul, the Iraqi stronghold of the terrorist group Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL), was launched on October 17. The offensive force is a 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi Army troops, Kurdish Peshmerga militias, Iraq-backed Shiite militias, Turkish expeditionary forces and Western special operations troops providing targeting for US-led coalition airstrikes and advice to the local forces. The operation is the largest since the US invaded Iraq in 2003.\nThe strength of IS forces occupying Mosul is estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 fighters, including 1,000 foreign militants. Their underwhelming numbers are compensated by two years of preparation, guerrilla tactics involving hit-and-run attacks on communications, use of devastating armored car bombs driven by suicide drivers, and a civilian population of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city that may be as high as 1.5 million, who serve as human shields for the militants.\nAfter the month-long assault, Mosul\u2019s liberation is nowhere to be seen, coalition members acknowledge while maintaining confidence that the day will come.\n\u201cThe threat that IS poses is still far from being eradicated and our mission is by no means accomplished,\u201d the German Foreign Ministry said in a statement after a meeting of the coalition\u2019s Small Group in Berlin.\n\u201cIt is still impossible to predict how long it will take to liberate the cities of Mosul and Raqqa from IS. However, it is clear that it is extremely urgent to plan for the time ahead, to stabilize the territories that will one day be liberated and to offer the people in the region prospects for the future\u201d (para. 1-6).\nIn the contested neighborhoods, east of Mosul residents get killed by both sides and are often not sure which to fear more.

Unless this was a baffling oversight, the 20-mile-wide corridor of desert seemed intended to give Islamic State fighters an escape route to the group's strongholds in Syria, perhaps to limit the destruction in Mosul.\nAll that changed when the Shiite militias fighting under the umbrella of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) opened a new front in the desert to close the gap. They have already reached the outskirts of Tal Afar, a Turkmen-majority city 35 miles west of Mosul.\nShiite PMF units were explicitly excluded from the liberation of Mosul itself in an effort to reassure the city's predominately Sunni population. But Shiite militias' side mission in Tal Afar should hardly be a surprise. The city is closely associated with the rise of the Islamic State and its forerunner, al Qaeda in Iraq, and has become infamous as a nest of Sunni terrorists. In 2014, the city's Shiite residents were expelled during the Islamic State takeover of northern Iraq.\nNow the Shiite fighters want to take Tal Afar back -- and, some suspect, to exact revenge. In April, Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the Iranian-backed Badr Organization, began staking out the movement's claim to dispense justice on the city. At the time, he told one of us: \"Only the Popular Mobilization Forces can go to Tal Afar.\"\nSince 2003, Tal Afar has played an outsized role in Iraq's violent politics. The city, which is just six square miles across, grew up around a 100-foot-high citadel. Its pre-2003 population of around 200,000 was mostly ethnically Turkmen and approximately three-quarters Sunni and one-quarter Shiite. In the 1980s, Saddam Hussein rewarded loyal Turkmen officers with property grants in the town's newer northern districts, including Saad, Bouri, and Qadisiyah (para. 1-5).

ISIS has deployed snipers to rooftops of still-inhabited houses, denying the ISF the ability to call in airstrikes lest striking the families inside. ISIS has also been pulling civilians into the city from surrounding villages to be used as shields while executing hundreds of civilians accused of collaborating with the ISF. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) confirmed on November 11 that ISIS used blistering agents against both civilians and security forces in Qayyarah in late August. The report,  following accounts of chlorine and mustard gas attacks in Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul, and the burning sulfur plant north of Qayyarah, underscores that ISIS will continue to use chemical weapons as part of its defense as well.\nThe ISF and Peshmerga have also been accused of human rights violations, which could undermine the mission to defeat and prevent the reconstitution of insurgent groups in Iraq. Amnesty International reported on November 10 that men in Federal Police uniforms had carried out extrajudicial killings of accused ISIS members in towns south of Mosul, while HRW accused in a November 15 report ISF members of mutilating ISIS corpses and executing surrendered militants, both of which constitute war crimes. HRW also issued a report on November 10 accusing both ISF and Peshmerga officials of unlawfully detaining or disappearing suspected ISIS militants at screening centers and camps around Mosul. Officials from the Iraqi and Kurdistan Regional Governments have denied the reports. Nevertheless, reports of human rights abuses underscore the high risk that the violations will increase as forces move into the dense urban terrain and the line between civilian and militant blurs. If the ISF fails to prove itself a better champion to Mosul\u2019s population than ISIS was in 2014, it sets conditions for another insurgent group to exploit the seams between civilians and the government and resurge in ISIS\u2019s wake...\"\n"], [11096, "2016-11-16T21:04:46Z", [0.01], "The battle now last 4 weeks and there are only 6 weeks left untill Dec 31st \nFrom all the reports I can not conclude that 40% of the work has been done and with the 80/20 rule when this will develope linear there is not change retaking the city before Jan 1st. \nSo lowering further from 4 to 1 %  "], [493, "2016-11-16T20:48:49Z", [0.75], "Coming down because of slow progress.

They are jointly advancing on the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar, less than 50 miles west of Mosul, Pentagon officials confirmed Monday. Those units are trying to cut off possible escape routes for Islamic State fighters between western Mosul and the Syrian border, as Iraqi and Kurdish forces continue to press into the city\u2019s northern, eastern and southern borders. But this mingling of Iraqi government troops and the Shiite militias could put U.S. commanders in the uncomfortable position of having to provide American air support for militias with clear links to the Iranian regime, something Washington fiercely opposes.\nU.S. commanders have made clear that no American assets would be used to assist or reinforce advancing militias fighting under the banner of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a U.S. defense official told The Washington Times. That policy will remain in place despite the presence of Iraqi troops within the militia\u2019s ranks, the official said. It is unclear how U.S. forces would respond if the Iraqi troops embedded with the militias called for American airstrikes, since American assets are tasked with defending Iraqi and coalition forces. \u201cThat is going to be a challenge,\u201d the official said. Potential responses by U.S. forces to attacks on embedded Iraqi troops with the militias would not be limited to American fighters and bombers, a second U.S. defense official said. Armed American drones and U.S. artillery batteries in and around Tal Afar also could be used to defend Iraqi forces fighting alongside the militias, the official said Monday.\n\u201cThe Iraqis have [jet] fighters too,\u201d the official noted (para. 1-9).

Two points: first, the thirty (30) day hiatus since last update date was  intended to await developments on Iraq Security Forces ( ISF) beginning within the Central City operations. Secondly, to achieve a certain detachment/distance from the issue after nearly a year of covering the Mosul dilemma. A. SYNOPSIS:\nOn the one hand, this new forecast attempts to balance vested Iraqi, Kurd, Iranian, Turkish &, other  Coalition interests on the NARROW issue of a physical retaking & control  of Mosul w/in the GJ resolution date 1/1/17.  On the other hand, in so balancing the above-mentioned issue, I remain unable to blend out on the ground facts of the BROADER dilemma: a) the complexities & unforeseen  consequences of URBAN warfare within Mosul city center (example of crashing waves phenomenon) &, b) whether the actual ISIL loss of physical possession and, control of the City, nonetheless sets in motion political objectives which align neither with the will of its people nor,  the Coalitions' ultimate objectives of retaking Mosul (1).  That is, achieving the objective of the more narrow  issue without closure on the broader question would be tantamount to a pyrrhic victory without geopolitical substance. Indeed, there is an already an abundance of both circumstantial & direct  evidence that, as of this date, ISIL still remains in control of important parts of the City. However, adding more complications to the clear eventual outcome of loss of control; Mosul battle responsibilities point clearly in the direction of further SECTARIAN unrest as Shiite  oriented forces PMF &, HASHD al-Shabbi engage directly in Mosul to the dismay of Mosul Sunni's(2).  ***In one of the most HORRIFIC scenes of arguable war crime dilemma Shi'ite Militia are disgustingly caught on camera, dragging a young boy in Mosul in front of a tank after being brutally beaten. 2(a)*** Cautionary viewing advised.  Additionally, Human Rights Watch also recently released a report arguing Peshmerga has systematically destroyed a large number of Arab homes & villages in the past (2015) after having retaken from ISIL. Conduct that is subject to human rights abuses. 2 (a1)   None of this bodes well for innocent inhabitants of Mosul looking forward into 2017. Thus, although geographic progress has been made in spite of the horrendous acts of violence perpetrated by both sides, Mosul's inner city nonetheless still presents a major task. For example, although Peshmerga forces now claim full control over BASHIQA a town just outside of Mosul, it took them close to two weeks. 2(b).   MOSUL is not Bashiqa. On the other hand, over the weekend Iraqi forces continued to secure another 10 Mosul city districts on western bank of Tigris River from Islamic State, according to  Iraq's Counterterrorism Department Major General Ma'an al-Sa'adi .2(c) ***Thus, a careful reading establishes that by doubling up my forecast, I am essentially simultaneously adding MORE layers of uncertainty not, less.*** B. PROCEDURAL vs. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE:  (a) Balancing a Poor Forecasting  Estimate Versus Being Cognitively Empathetic to the Facts on the Ground ( NB: myself intended only) (3)  Since 12/12/15, when I began coverage of this GJ Q, the original hypothesis / forecast has not changed, dramatically.   Occasionally,  although, there has been CONCERN that being unwilling to modify this hypothesis/forecast was evidence of being too dogmatic, steadfast/single minded; facts on the ground time &, again, have provided sufficient support for an extremely low forecast, at least through this date. So, I still remain uncertain on this issue. Like most others on this Q, an enormous amount of time & effort has been paid to Mosul.  The return of this payment to date has been: EMPATHY, at least in my case. On the one hand, becoming immersed & \"reasonably well\" versed provided perspective and understanding.  On the other hand, getting bogged down, at times on the facts & circumstances, created an emotional attention, which over time could have  ( wishy washy word 'cuz I'm still uncertain)  clouded perspective &, loss of balance on weighing evidence on single question which was flagged a few months ago : as one of interpretation/definition: will anti-IS forces retake Mosul b/f 1/1/17?  (b) Versus The Risks/Rewards of  Empathetic Commitment On the one hand, the risk of \"getting too close\" to an issue that obfuscates objective determination of a Q is a - common mistake.  Planting an Iraqi Flag  in the Center of Mosul and, thereafter  claiming it has been retaken for political purposes is now, a more viable task with it logically being given higher probability.  On the other hand, the reward  of sufficiently deep analysis is that it has provided FORWARD LOOKING perspective that factually & substantively lead to at least one clear conclusion from my perspective.  The compelling weight of geopolitical evidence GJ participants have been offered by the Turks, the Iranians, the Kurds & the Iraqis is : Iraq with its historic NATION/STATE borders cutting across ethnic & cultural  boundaries has made very clear, once again, that each of these Countries remain focused on carving up parts of this territory for their particular historic interests, again.  The Kurdish issue is exemplary. A never ending dilemma. Iraq has a terrible track record of dealing successfully with these cultural/sectarian issues.  Thus, when Mosuli's remain unsuccessful in pleading with Bagdad for their own political structure, there remains substantial circumstantial evidence the repetitive historical cultural subjugation, sectarian violence  process of carving up or separating out the winners & losers begins again. Which, in fact, reignites the fundamental distrust that has existed in the first instance. (2) Suffice it to say, that on the HUMANITARIAN issue alone, using Fallujah, as a small example,  the above-mentioned competing interests leave little room for Bagdad's ability to manage these cross current cultural/sectarian issues. (3a) C. NEW FACTS JUSTIFYING HIGHER FORECAST PROBABILITY (a) Undisputedly, Kurdish Peshmerga have completed their cleansing process up to the gates of Mosul. This has been free of serious setback w/ the exceptions of KIRKUT & BASHIQA as above referenced. Additionally, Iraqi Security Forces ( ISF) have now advanced &, cleared a major portion of  eastern & SE neighborhoods. (4) Morever, Coalition Forces have begun a combination attack of Mosul & Raqqa, the long term consequence all of which presents serious harm to ISIL. 4(a)   Indeed, in traditional IRAQI fashion, there have even been emboldened predictions Mosul will be taken in more than a month end(??? pretty wishy washy forecast!!) but, now according to AbdulGhani al-Asadi, Commander of Iraq Counter Terrorism Forces ( ICTF) NO LATER than year end (5).  Surreal as it is &, irrespective of the emotional/psychological damage caused to the innocent Mosul women/children standing in harms way, the ICTF, incidentally, are wearing headgear those with those erie looking fighters using the SKELETON masks during their exercises in Mosul. (6) Thus, although no one disputes the expected progress to date, there are also nonetheless additional basic facts on the ground that complicate the retaking b/f 1/1/17.  Moving beyond the outskirts of a full scale attack into the Central City itself is an immense task.(7)  Not only is this a critical issue as exemplified by Gorilla & Urban  warfare tactics seen for example in Aleppo. Tunnel systems within Mosul have open up an entirely new form of urban battle, as we have all seen.  Yet,  even MASROUR BARZANI head of KRG recently reiterated the battle of western Mosul will be complex, take time &, must  avoid inflaming sectarian tensions which already appear on the forefront. (8). (b) Additionally, on the one hand, as evidence of Coalition progress towards Mosul,  ISIL leader al-Bagdahi has recently been forced to issue a \"CALL TO ARMS\" to fight to the death (9). Admittedly, whether he is still alive &, if so, where he is remains an open question. Moreover, his pitch to followers was reminiscent of Gaddafi & Hussain's last ditch pleas ( MOTHER OF ALL BATTLES, remember that one??) which had no substantial effect on the very numbered days of both Hussain & Gaddafi.  Whether al-Bagdahi is dead or alive, ISIL fighters  are nonetheless  following through w/ the most GRIEVOUS of crimes including using civilians as human shields, using \"scorched earth\" tactics & more recently investigations into \"beheading of innocent civilians\"!(10). Additionally, there is circumstantial evidence ISIL is also stock piling chemical weapons in Mosul. (11) D. LESS THAN FIFTY (50) DAYS TO RESOLUTION OF GJ QUESTION OF \"RETAKING\" @Anneinak 's  7/11/16  **comment & attached excellent thread therein** could not have more succinctly addressed all the relevant issues, so I avoid reiterating all the well documented issues contained therein.  CONCLUSION: On the one hand, \"time is of the essence\" on the simple procedural Q of retaking set by GJ Admin.  On the other hand,  progress by ISF has indeed been made.  I can neither emphatically, nor w/ a substantial degree of confidence, dispute ISF will not announce a retaking of Mosul b/f 1/1/17.  Indeed, the above mentioned update can simply be referred to as a HUGE QUALIFICATION raising more, not less certainty on the question.  Be that as it may,  I also have no substantial degree of certainty on this retaking issue. Balanced against this dilemma, I have an urge to alter my forecast ( perhaps dramatically) but, continue to uncover sufficient & reliable facts & circumstances that support my uncertainty w/in the resolution time frames. Thus, I remain well below consensus for the time being.

There's significant areas that have been retaken, but most of the retaken areas have been empty.  I notice how cities and villages are initially surrounded, then retaken.  Right now, Mosul is only about 75% surrounded, if that, after more than 3 weeks.  Surrounding a city is the easy part for a mechanized army. Comparing Scholarandcat's map to the one at http://isis.liveuamap.com/en, I count 6 neighborhoods of Mosul \"retaken\", though none seem secure.   I count 34 neighborhoods on the east bank, and 19 on the west.  So, I ask myself how many of those neighborhoods would have to be under nominal control to  justify a claim of \"retaken\"?  Minimums might be:\n80% of east bank + 50% of west  which would be  27+9=36  \n70% of east + 60% of west which would be 24+11=35\n60% of all neighborhoods would be 32 neighborhoods For a very minimal estimate then, maybe 32-4 neighborhoods would need to be under coalition control to justify a claim of \"retaken\".   The entrance into the first neighborhood (Gogjali) was on about Oct 31.  That means that 32-4 neighborhoods will need to be taken in 61 days/8+ weeks.  That would mean about 4 neighborhoods per week.   After about a week, 6 neighborhoods have been retaken.  At this rate, well more than 34 neighborhoods will have been retaken by New Years.   But fighting in Mosul city seems to have become a game of whack-a-mole, with ISIS fighters popping up from undiscovered tunnels behind the lines in \"retaken\" neighborhoods.  This makes it both easier and more difficult to declare a region \"retaken\":  an area appears to have been taken only to have it re-erupt in fighting. Questions:\n-Will 34 neighborhoods be enough to justify a claim of \"retaken\"? \n-Will the rate of progress stall because the inner city will be more favorable to defending by ISIS?\n-Will the rate of progress increase as ISIS fighters become more exhausted, demoralized and isolated?\n-Will residents participate?  in support of whom?  \n        ISIS-by hiding soldiers & giving them support?  \n        the coalition--by staging revolts and informing on ISIS?  \n-How will the suicide bomber strategy play out?\n          It seems like a dumb strategy when the ratio of fighters is so lopsided against the suicide bombers; ISIS has limited soldiers while the coalition doesn't. \n          A mentality that embraces suicide might empower soldiers to take risks that might be very damaging to the coalition, but it might also undermine the will to fight.  Once fatigue and demoralization reach a certain level, why wouldn't a guy just decide to strap on a vest and go blow himself up, doing so in less than optimally strategic circumstances?  How might the mentality of ISIS fighters be different/the same as that of the Japanese? \n-What will the rate of attrition of ISIS' fighting men be? It sounds like more than 100 ISIS soldiers have killed themselves and maybe 6-900 have been killed by the coalition.  The high estimates of ISIS fighters at the beginning of the battle were in the 8-9,000 range.  That means that ISIS has lost perhaps 10% of its soldiers already. \n- I wonder what % of losses a unit can sustain and still remain functional in an urban gorilla war?  Historically, at what % of loss have units just collapsed?  (Outside view) I'm keeping in mind comparisons: \n-look at how long the battle for Aleppo has gone on!  It began in earnest about July 2012!!! -How long it took to retake Fallujah (pop 275k).  A siege of about 3 months preceded the  battle which began on 22 May 2016.  5 weeks later, on 26 June, Iraqi forces had recaptured the city, before recapturing the remaining pocket of ISIL resistance in Fallujah's western outskirts two days later -How long it took to retake Ramadi (pop 375k). The operation to retake Ramadi began in early November 2015.   On 28 December 2015, Iraq's government claimed that it retook the city  - Or how long it took to \"retake\" Kohani (pop 44k) --which, unlike Mosul, had basically been abandoned by citizens so could be bombed into a heap of rubble.   Conclusion:  this question will need close watching for rate & extent of progress and # of ISIS killed.  Most analysts seem to think that the fighting will become more intense and favorable to ISIS as the center of the city is approached, so I'm still negative about Mosul being retaken before New Years, but I'm moving up a little because there's been significant progress."], [29507, "2016-11-07T16:55:08Z", [0.3], "Although initial progress as Mosul's urban perimeter looked optimistic, the reality of Urban combat is simply brutal with civilian causalities spiking (security forces will have to move much slower to do their absolute best to keep these numbers down).

But they're not as strong as they once were. They come to battle with a mix of qualities and capabilities among regiments (para 6). ISIS, an agile enemy, has been preparing its defenses for two years. It takes advantage of the terrain, a network of tunnels and booby-trapped buildings, to great effect. US military officials estimate there are 3,000 to 5,000 ISIS fighters in Mosul. An additional 1,500 to 2,000 ISIS fighters may be waiting outside the city limits. The streets of Kirkukli, a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Mosul, are tight and narrow. ISIS' style is not to challenge Iraqi forces on open ground, which would make them inviting targets for air power. So they sit and wait for Iraqi forces to move into densely populated areas. Then they pounce. The use of civilians as shields makes it difficult for Iraqi forces to fire at snipers. ISIS has mastered this classic tactic of guerrilla warfare. And many ISIS fighters, particularly those left behind in areas east of Mosul, know they're going to die. Fighters are known to pop out from behind buildings, just yards from approaching Humvees, to unleash rocket-propelled grenades.

Artillery shelling thundered across the city as snipers traded fire from rooftops and civilians emerged from the front lines waving white flags. There were fresh indications that other residents were being held back by the militants to be used as human shields. The seesawing battle highlights the challenges ahead for Iraqi forces as they press into more densely populated neighborhoods of the country's second largest city, where they will not be able to rely as much on airstrikes because of the risk of killing civilians. \"Daesh is in the city center and we must be very careful as our forces advance,\" said Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces, using the Arabic acronym for IS. The special forces entered the Gogjali district, on the eastern edge of Mosul, on Tuesday, marking their first major foray into the city itself after more than two weeks of fighting in its rural outskirts. IS fought back Saturday, pushing the special forces from the southern edge of the neighborhood. Both sides fired mortar rounds and automatic weapons, while the Iraqi troops also responded with artillery. Snipers dueled from rooftops in residential areas, where most buildings are just two stories high.\nDozens of civilians emerged from their homes over the course of the day, some carrying white flags. Many civilians traveling with children and elderly relatives said they had to walk more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) to reach a camp for the displaced. Just a few kilometers (miles) from the clashes, Iraqi officers coordinating airstrikes with the U.S.-led coalition watched live drone footage showing a team of IS fighters regrouping near the front line. \"They're moving in front of the mosque,\" an Iraqi soldier said as he called in an airstrike, which moments later flattened a small building. Civilians moved into the area soon thereafter, and the soldiers said the militants appeared to have corralled them there to prevent further strikes (para. 1-9). George, S. & Abdul-Zahra, Q. (2016).

Isis hit the tank amid the most intense clashes of the two-week assault on Mosul. The rocket that hit the US-made tank was fired from a nearby building and sent the crew fleeing from the smoking vehicle.\nIt does not appear the strike caused any casualties, the Associated Press reported. The militant group, which has held Mosul for two years since it made a rapid incursion across northern Iraq in the summer of 2014, has targeted Iraqi positions with mortar strikes.

I'm surprised consensus is only up to 43% (vs. 40% then).  By my count, we are at 18 days since offensive was announced, 58 days remaining until qn closes. Just looking at the responses, there seems to be a huge range of opinions / rationales.  I am reading the news, but really using just two main sources here: a) http://isis.liveuamap.com/ map everyone links to; b) https://twitter.com/MosulEye daily twitter/blog updates of one-the-ground happenings in city. My current thoughts: 1) There were initially worries about whether coalition would hold together (both because of internal tensions and because of training/morale vs. v. intense/committed ISIS troops).  I am no longer very worried about this - it appears they have been quite effective thus far, and I would be surprised if the offensive ultimately fails due to coalition crumbling/effectiveness/inability to re-take city.  It seems now that this is primarily a question of timing. 2) Coalition has taken territory thus far at very a rapid pace.  Of course it is true that what ISIS still holds is likely to be the hardest to retake, but the eastern neighborhoods are dense/urban and have been falling quickly in last 48 hrs (first Gogjali ~24 hrs ago, then update w/ 6 more neighborhoods: al-Malayin, al-Samah, al-Khazra, Kirkukli, al-Quds and al-Karama, ~7 hrs ago, and now just in last couple hrs reports of fighting spreading out across much of rest of eastern bank. 3) At this pace, I would expect the eastern bank to fall in the next few days.  According to the live map, the US bombed out the main bridge within last few hrs, and there is active fighting up to Nineveh ruins on map (according to Mosul Eye), which is already almost to the river.  At this point, it seems fairly clear this qn is mostly just a bet about a) How big a quagmire the western bank neighborhoods will be; and b) what constitutes \"retaking\" Mosul. On a) ISIS reportedly began the battle with 5-6K troops.  There have been mixed reports about whether or not any fled.  Many have mentioned the Al-Baghdadi message re: not fleeing as a rationale for why battle will take a long time / qn will resolve to no.  On flip side, some news outlets claim satellites show roads to Raqqa clogged w/ trucks: http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/03/mass-exodus-as-isis-fighters-families-flee-mosul-for-raqqa.html. I don't know if that's true, but regardless, after casualties and any fled, we're talking about how long a few thousand troops can hold out in a small area against an army of literally >100K + air support amongst a local population that is likely mostly hostile to their cause. There are apparently reports of some citizen-led popular uprisings in Mosul against ISIS (http://isis.liveuamap.com/en/2016/4-november-iraqi-state-tv-reports-popular-uprisings-against).  I don't put too much stock in this, but I don't think this is a situation where local population is going to help them stay dug-in.  \n\nb) I'm assuming they will call this qn when the Iraqi army declares that they've taken the city.  So far, they've been making announcements on TV every time they \"take\" a neighborhood.

The exchange was part of a series of public exchanges that have characterized dialogue between Moscow and Washington in the absence of progress to end the Aleppo siege.

High Commissioner for Human Rights, said. The tactic is a familiar one. In previous battles, Islamic State fighters have retreated to safety and loaded their trucks with civilians to deter U.S.-led coalition airstrikes from targeting them. The militants began shuttling civilians from surrounding villages to Mosul on Oct. 17, the first day of the Iraqi-led ground offensive. Since then, Islamic State has forcibly relocated thousands of families and executed at least 232 people, including former Iraqi military personnel shot on Wednesday, according to the U.N.\nIraqi military sources said their coalition had killed 772 Islamic State militants in combat as of Thursday.

The northern axis continues to focus on regaining the towns of Batnaya and Tel Kayyaf, north of Mosul, in order to position forces to breach Mosul's northern city limits. The Peshmerga entered the Christian town of Batnaya on October 25, but are not assessed to be in control of the city. The Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) is poised to breach Mosul's outskirts from both the east and northeast but called for an operational pause on October 25 in order to wait for the southern axis to advance such that the encirclement of the city is evenly distributed.\n\nThe southern axis, however, has made limited progress during this pause. Operation Inherent Resolve Commander Lt. Gen. Steve Townsend described this area of ISIS's defense as a \"very hard external crust,\" outside of Mosul's hard core and a soft middle on October 26. The ISF has faced resistance from ISIS's suicide attacks and is limited by a shortage in manpower. ISIS has also created a chemical barrier by igniting a sulfur plant on fire located near the confluence of the Tigris and Zab Rivers, north of Qayyarah, when they withdrew from the plant on October 20. The toxic plume of smoke will continue to halt forward movement until the sulfur fire is mitigated or MOPP suits are delivered, though the additional layers of clothing will likely further slow forward progress. \n\nThe ISF finally breached Shura's city limits, north of Qayyarah, on October 28, having encircled the city since October 19. The ISF will need to break through ISIS's external crust and quickly make up progress towards Mosul, lest the axes grow out of sync. The southern axis may require additional reinforcements as it will face more attrition than the other axes due to its longer distance to travel towards Mosul.\n\nNew players are entering the operation. One thousand five hundred members of the Turkish-backed Ninewa Guard Force, based out of Zaylkan, are assessed to be operating alongside the 16th Iraqi Army Division around Tel Kayyaf. It is unclear if the group's Turkish advisors are among the forces or if they remain at their base in Zaylkan, where another 1,500 members remain in reserve. All major Iraqi parties, especially the Shi'a militias, have rejected Turkey's presence in northern Iraq; Turkish direct or indirect participation in the Mosul operation could escalate tensions between Turkey and Iraq. Shi'a militias have also stepped up their involvement in the Mosul operation and are working to open a western axis towards Tel Afar from their current position alongside the Federal Police near Qayyarah. Militia involvement could spark intra-Coalition tensions, especially if Kurdish, Turkish, ISF, and militia forces converge in an area with a proclivity for Sunni insurgency.

One week into the fight for Mosul, and the battle has expanded across Iraq, but has yet to start inside the city itself. Iraqi forces and Kurdish Peshmerga are within just a few miles of the city, pushing from the south, east, and north as an estimated 1,500 ISIS fighters are making a fighting retreat back into their fortified strongholds within Mosul. To slow the coalition\u2019s advance, they\u2019re lighting oil pits, sending columns of thick black smoke into the sky, and laying hundreds of buried bombs along the roadways. Just a few miles away, as many as 5,000 well supplied and deeply dug in ISIS fighters, surrounded by unwilling civilian human shields, await. Fighting spreads. American military officials have said they expect ISIS to lash out in other areas of Iraq to try and shift Baghdad\u2019s attention from Mosul, and the assaults on Kirkuk on Friday, and Rutba in far western Iraq on Sunday -- both hundreds of miles from Mosul -- have pulled some troops into the fight to secure those cities. The fighting in both places continued through Sunday, with several suicide bombers hitting Kirkuk throughout the day. In Rutba, reports indicate that ISIS has taken control of half of the town. Toxic attack. But the biggest surprise came Saturday, when Islamic State fighters lit a sulphur plant on fire, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the skies around Mosul. A defense official speaking on condition of anonymity told SitRep that U.S. troops at Camp Swift and Qayyarah West Airfield near Mosul \u201care in an area far enough away that there is minimal threat to any lasting health effects,\u201d but all troops have gas masks, and they have the option of using them. About 1,000 Iraqi civilians have been sickened by the fumes already. Intel surge. The Pentagon is sending dozens of new intelligence analysts to Iraq to help sift through what leaders think will be an intelligence windfall when the city eventually falls. But hundreds of ISIS fighters have been fleeing the city though an open western corridor to Syria, one tribal chief near the border tells CNN. Big win for the Kurds, may anger Baghdad. The clouds of black smoke don\u2019t appear to be slowing things down much. On Sunday, the Kurds look to have captured the ISIS-held town of Bashiqa, only five miles from Mosul, which would open up a critical lane into the city. But the victory might come at a long-term cost. The Kurds were supported by Turkish artillery, fired from a base near the town that houses hundreds of Turkish troops, along with dozens of tanks and artillery pieces. Baghdad says they\u2019re there without the consent of the Iraqi government, and wants them out. Ankara refuses. Americans in the middle of the feud. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited Turkey, Baghdad, and the Kurdish city of Erbil over the weekend to huddle with U.S. military commanders and local officials leading the fight. The visit produced some real tension, as Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi soundly rejected a preliminary agreement Carter appeared to have reached with Turkish officials that would open the door for Turkey to become more involved in the Mosul operation. While there were some vague threats of war last week over the base, Abadi toned things down Saturday, saying it\u2019s \u201cimportant for us to have good relations with Turkey...I know that the Turks want to participate, we tell them thank you, this is something the Iraqis will handle and the Iraqis will liberate Mosul.\u201d But the Shiite militias that Baghdad is preparing to send west of Mosul aren\u2019t looking to decrease tensions with Turkey.

The suggestion, against all evidence, is that better statesmen, or perhaps a more patriotic one, could have gotten more. Among other things, Erdogan\u2019s reinterpretation of history shows the ironies behind the widespread talk in the United States of his supposed \u201cneo-Ottomanism.\u201d A decade ago, Erdogan\u2019s enthusiasm for all things Ottoman appeared to be part of an effective strategy for improving relations with the Muslim Middle East, a policy that some U.S. critics saw as a challenge to their country\u2019s role in the region. But refashioning the National Pact as a justification for irredentism rather than a rebuke of it has not been popular among Turkey\u2019s neighbors. Criticism of Erdogan\u2019s neo-Ottoman foreign policy is now as likely to come from the Arab world as anywhere else. Erdogan\u2019s use of the National Pact also demonstrates how successfully Turkey\u2019s Islamists have reappropriated, rather than rejected, elements of the country\u2019s secular nationalist historical narrative. Government rhetoric has been quick to invoke the heroism of Turkey\u2019s war of independence in describing the popular resistance to the country\u2019s July 15 coup attempt. And alongside the Ottomans, Erdogan routinely references the Seljuks, a Turkic group that preceded the Ottomans in the Middle East by several centuries, and even found a place for more obscure pre-Islamic Turkic peoples like the Gokturks, Avars, and Karakhanids that first gained fame in Ataturk\u2019s 1930s propaganda. Similarly, in Syria and Iraq, Erdogan is aiming to achieve a long-standing national goal, the defeat of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), by building on the traditional nationalist tools of Turkish foreign policy \u2014 namely, the leveraging of Turkish minorities in neighboring countries. The Sultan Murad Brigade, comprising predominantly ethnic Turkmens, has been one of Ankara\u2019s military assets inside Syria against both Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and the PKK. Meanwhile, the Turkmen population living around Mosul and its surrounding area has been a concern and an asset for Ankara in Iraq.

There are differing versions of the proposed borders of a shrunken Turkish state that the nationalists in the Ottoman parliament put forward \u2014 one of them is reproduced above. Some areas indicated would be allowed to hold referendums; others were considered integral Turkish territory. As you can see, though, Mosul was very much part of this vision. Instead, the Ottoman court signed the withering Treaty of Sevres in 1920, which would have seen what's now Turkey carved up into various spheres of influence controlled by the West, Kurds, Armenians and others. That never came to pass: Turkish nationalists in the Ottoman army mobilized and eventually forced out foreign forces. In the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey's modern borders were set. Mosul, though, was a sticking point, with Turkish nationalists laying claim to it and demanding Britain hold a plebiscite in the region that's now northern Iraq. That didn't happen, and after some fitful politicking at the League of Nations, Turkey and Britain eventually agreed to an arrangement in 1926 where Ankara dropped its claim to Mosul and the nearby cities of Kirkuk and Sulaimanyah in exchange for a portion of the region's oil revenues over the next 25 years.

Consensus is at just 40%, and many of the forecasters I follow closely are lower still.  I'm coming out more optimistic. First off, a lot of the early reports from generals estimated timelines for the offensive of weeks to a few months (here is a 2 month estimate): http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-iraq/ This would put us about at a coin flip if you were just going by the estimated timeline, although you'd have to adjust that for whatever you think the odds the offensive fails is (i.e. 20% chance of failure, so 80% chance of success x 50% chance it's on time or ahead of time = 40% chance for qn).   That's where consensus still is (actually,from reading comments, I think people are assigning a much higher chance to total failure, but also a higher chance to idea that if city is taken, it will be on or ahead of schedule). Regardless, why come out more optimistic?  a) The offensive is reportedly already going faster than planned: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/10/20/iraq-mosul-operation-going-quicker-than-expected/92450398/ b) Some key towns have been captured (Bartella) -http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/fierce-isil-resistance-iraqi-troops-move-mosul-161020185326305.html , which from what I can gather is fairly strategic in terms of positioning and that it allows for shelling of mosul itself. c) Trying not to be too swayed by this, but I can't get over that it is now a 3-front battle and it is 5-6K ISIS troops vs. 108.5K anti-ISIS troops (http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/20/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-iraq/). It is awful to think about tactically how they could slow the advance / use civilians to their advantage, and I could also imagine pockets of resistance remaining long after main battles are over. That said, it's just extremely difficult to believe that they're going to be able to hold the city for 76 days with such a massive mismatch of firepower and manpower.  (good map here of geography of it: http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/10/explosives-booby-traps-slow-mosul-offensive-161018140134022.html) d) ISIS obviously recognizes this reality, and has started withdrawing some resources to Syria, and a commander is quoted as saying \"\u201cThere will be no big great epic battle in Mosul... The tactic now is hit-and-run.\u201d (h/t @andrewsabisky - https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/352129 ).  That makes a lot more sense to me than trying to fight directly.  If your tactic is hit and run though, you aren't likely to hold a city for long. e) All that said, the best eye-witness acct in city I have found is here: mosuleye.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/whats-happening-in-mosul-mosul-eye-report-oct-20-2016/ .  This tells a much different story, and it does in fact sound like they are digging in and preparing to wage a prolonged battle for city (number of troops apparently rising over time as more are called to defend city).   So net-net, I'm starting at 70% chance (or 30% higher than consensus).  I'd acknowledge what a lot of the very low %-chance estimators have argued, which is that there are many reasons to worry about tensions amongst the coalition forces as well as their effectiveness.  I think even with the imbalance of forces, you'd have to grant there is a decent chance the group falters and the offensive fails. I'm putting it at a 20% chance, although admittedly w/o a great rationale for that.

Toksabay and McDowall (2016) states that: ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkish air strikes pounded a group of Kurdish fighters allied to a U.S.-backed militia in northern Syria overnight, highlighting the conflicting agendas of NATO members Ankara and Washington in an increasingly complex battlefield. The jets targeted positions of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in three villages, northeast of the city of Aleppo, that the SDF had captured from Islamic State, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late on Wednesday. The Turkish military confirmed its warplanes had carried out 26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia, the strongest force in the SDF, and that it had killed between 160 and 200 combatants. The British-based Observatory monitoring group reported a much lower toll of at least 14 dead and dozens wounded. Officials of the Kurdish-led administration that controls much of northeastern Syria said dozens had been killed. Complicating matters further, Syria's military called the strikes by Turkey an act of \"blatant aggression\" and said it would bring down any Turkish war planes entering Syrian air space (para. 1-6).

ISIS isn't going to sit still and just be pounded; there will certainly be temporary or isolated setbacks for the Iraqis, and rumors of defeat can demoralize an army with fragile morale (as the article hints morale is).

Consequently, although the ISF will lead the operations into the city proper, they will need to cooperate with the Kurdish Peshmerga, who hold the majority of terrain surrounding the city. However, the Peshmerga participating in anti-ISIS operations will likely exploit the opportunity to take control of areas by displacing Sunni Arabs from their homes, as they did following operations in Sinjar in November 2015.  The shortage of manpower also leaves a gap for Iranian-backed Shi\u2019a militias, which will likely follow the ISF as they clear the cities and remain as a part of the holding force, as they have already done in Shirqat. The Popular Mobilization reported on October 10 that militias are moving to the Ninewa provincial border to participate.

Erdogan also announced that Turkey is actively participating in Mosul operations following PM Abadi\u2019s announcement of operations, which could open up conflict with Iraqi Shi\u2019a militias who vow to attack Turkish forces.  \"The operation to retake Mosul is resulting in a dangerous convergence of Shi\u2019a, Tur\"kish, and Kurdish actors as they jockey for influence in northern Iraq. Iranian proxy militias appear set to play a major role in the operation. A multi-party sectarian, ethnic, and international conflict will likely give opportunities to ISIS and other Sunni insurgent groups, such as the Baathist group Jaysh Rijal al-Tariqa al-Naqshbandia (JRTN), to reconstitute after areas have been cleared.\" As the battle has begun, I cannot discount the possibility for a swift ISIS collapse.\nGiven the clearance rate  at Falluja and Ramadi, the inability to deploy full air resources due to collateral damage to civilians, short of a complete ISIS collapse; \"taking\" Mosul is  likely to take as long as Assad and Russians clearing Aleppo, past the first of the year. But as the battle has commenced, while I cannot foresee an ISIS collapse; I cannot rule it out. Hence I am at 7% and will adjust based on progress of battle."], [27228, "2016-10-17T14:27:25Z", [0.76], "Comment deleted on Oct 17, 2016 03:24PM UTC"], [24474, "2016-10-17T14:26:26Z", [0.16], "Battle for Mosul has started.

Adjusting from 4 to 7% chance leaving me still significantly below GJ consensus. Here is why. A. MOSUL IN  DISEQUILIBRIUM  The narrative for political disequilibrium could not have been scripted with more geopolitical chaos &, consequence.   Beyond the fact ISIL will  NOT  prevail, the main issue remains @ what price &, on what time line  retaking or regaining \"possession & control\" of Mosul will take place.   For perspective, on \"possession & control\" the parameters of Mosul is divided right in the middle by the Tigris River ( Left Coast = Northern part  & East Coast = Southern part the size of 32,308km2 (A).  NB Retaking Discussion  below C ( Declarations of Retaking). Suffice it to say, to RETAKE is to substantively regain possession or control of Mosul, not simply a part of the City.  When the Moors retook Barcelona in 799 it was only after a number of years not months. (B) To retake a City after having been in the hands of an enemy has clear & unmistakeable historical connotations that go to the definition of POSSESSION & CONTROL. (C) The underlying purpose and intent of this  so-called Coalition effort is to retake Mosul by regaining possession & control. Not simply a... PRESS CONFERENCE ...for the world to witness Iraqi or, any other non IS forces....claim...they have  \"retaken Mosul\", when it \"may\" effectively be merely a partial retaking only, with full blown urban warfare being conducted in other parts of Mosul. Why is this critical? His Credibility & Seriousness of Purpose. PM al-Abadi's political authority is SUSPECT in the first instance.  BAGDAD has a big problem. For example, on the political front, whether he will SURVIVE a no-vote of confidence before year end is critical to the Mosul campaign.   Former Iraqi PM al-Maliki ( CLEARLY Shiite  orientation in the run up to a Sunni dominated Mosul) made his political intentions increasingly clear after present PM al-Abadi has potentially a the loss of a THIRD  ( al-Obedi x Minister of Defense, Zebari x Finance Minister) Government  Minister.  Key supporter Minister of Foreign Affairs Ibrahim al-Jaafari's  is also also being subjected to an ouster effort earlier this month.(1) CRITICAL Point: UNCERTAINTY on the political front equals increased military risk & danger with Mosul's decent into disequilibrium.  B. IT'S BINARY, LETS FLIP A COIN, WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY?  For all the painstaking planning that has gone into Mosul on the one hand, the historic Kurdish interests for example ( Erbil is only 80km away from Mosul),  naturally differ substantially from the Turkish ( Ottoman Empire which was under full control  of this region from 1500-1800) &/or Iraqi motivations for Mosul.  Additionally, Iranian \"greater sphere of interests\" objectives on the other hand, are at odds w/ so-called Coalition plans Post ISIL Mosul.  In a nutshell, there is such a degree of uncertainty btw all of the above mentioned  that it remains on par with nothing short of a RANDOM Military & Political  Walk. More specifically, while Erdogan & al-Abadi exchange political rhetoric on Turkish participation in Mosul ( no you won't, on yes we will) (2), on the ground Peshmerga along with the Hashd al-Shaabi confirmed militarily, although considered instrumental to the \"retaking\",  Peshmerga promises NOT enter Mosul beyond certain quadrants.   KRG's commitment remains to the previously controlled Kurdish areas which they will NOT give up thereafter. Kurdish history runs deep in certain areas of Mosul.(3)  Peshmerga also confirms Hashd al-Shaabi will NOT participate in Mosul operations. Hashd, on the other hand, confirms  \"oh yes we will\"!  Iraqi PM al-Abadi has approved participation. (4)  Indeed, al-Abadi has gone so far as to kindly \"REQUEST\" Kurdish leader Barzani NOT to expand Kurdistan's territorial intentions. A strange approach for a Leader of a Military Operation? (5) Or, will the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) Shiite tribal militia carry the brunt of the fight within city limits, as they have elsewhere, with their openly expressed hatred of Iraqi/US forces into Mosul Sunni dominated City ?   EHTNIC cleansing Mosul style??(6)   Supportive of this note, the reliable MOSUL EYE, an independent communication source @MosulEye makes v clear, Mosulis consider Turkish forces nothing short of ISIL forces &, will be treated accordingly. (7) HEADS, will Turkey,  Hashd al-Shaabi participate ? TAILS, will PMF avoid its slaughter house tactics it miserably put on display in Fallujah relative to Sunni civilians?  To what extent? Where?  ****Finally****, when Qais Al-Khaz'ali, leader of Iranian backed PMF says Mosul WILL BE VENGENCE for Hussein, one has clear and convincing circumstantial evidence the Sectarian disputes that have plagued the planning phase have over a 90% probability of being put on display for the world to see but, on a much greater scale than Falljah. (8) CRITICAL Point: There is NO BALANCE OF POWER. The inherent uncertainty on the ground, when combined with the changing facts/circumstances @ the political level, make extremely clear political, military &, sectarian dispute probabilities/variability scenarios REMAIN extremely difficult when not impossible to reduce. ***al-Abadi ***has made a fundamental geopolitical error. By attempting to negotiate w/ all above mentioned parties, he has effectively LOST CONTROL over the regional security situation both in Bagdad (politically) & Mosul (on the battle ground).  C. DECLARATIONS of A RETAKING vs REMOVING ISIL TAKING TIME PROCEDURALLY, GJ Q resolves 1/1/17. EXPECT declarations of a \"retaking\" by ANYONE of these NON ISIL forces putting the onus on IRAQ's PM al-Abadi to confirm that Mosul has been \"retaken\" before year end.  NB: above-mentioned definitional retaking.  17/10/16 was the official commencement of the battle for Mosul according to PM al-Abadi. According to both his own previous assessments &, the resolution date of this GJ Q, that leaves seventy five ( 75 ) days to regain possession & control of a City that covers of thirty (30) kilometers inhabited by over one (1) million innocent bystanders. Thus,  al-Abadi's political credibility & career, among other issues depends upon a Mosul RETAKING.(9) Also, the Head of U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND confirmed as late as September, Mosul plans  are on track to being RETAKEN by year end. (10) Late September, even President Obama went on record to claim Mosul can be retaken quickly.(11)  Balanced against the \"it will happen before year end\" scenario, however, National Intelligence Director James Clapper made clear in late May a YEAR END retaking was difficult to envision. (12) Additionally, U.S. coalition spokesman on 14/10/16 Colonel John Dorrian made clear removing ISIL from Mosul will be a long, drawn out process that will take some time. (13)NATIONAL SECURITY officials have more recently  also pushed back on the \"quick solution\" scenario late September. Even Peshmerga sources make clear house to house urban warfare over the next six (6) months is a realistic scenario. (14) CRITICAL Point: SAVING POLITICAL FACE VS. REGAINING EFFECTIVE POSSESSION & CONTROL  With estimates ranging as high as one million civilians in the City, they will pay the highest price. EXPECT w/in the next sixty (60) days a FREE-FOR-ALL match to lay claim to a certain portions of the City. NB the fundamental distinction btw  regaining possession and control of city the size of Mosul on the one hand,  vs putting an Iraqi flag down on the ground and making claim the City has been retaken will remain a key issue. VESTED \" competing political interests, for the  balance of power in Mosul, as well the U.S. financial commitment  ( billions of U.S.$, excluding the lives of soldiers that are now in harms way),  compel a political justification for the UPCOMING publicity efforts at claims of retaking Mosul before year end. And, to make it more complex - by any one - of these non-Islamic state forces. CONCLUSION:  Mosul runs the gamut of political & military variables. It offers clues on both aleatory & epistemic risk management considerations. No certainty. With such degrees of uncertainty, the burden of proof remains on the prosecuting Coalition Forces to show beyond any reasonable doubt, it will achieve the ultimate objective responsibly & w/in the confines of acceptable humanitarian consequences w/in the stated timelines.  After careful consideration of all the above-mentioned, my best judgement takes me to a 7% chance that a NON IS force will regain possession & control of Mosul b/f 1/1/7. Still extremely cautious.

In social environments in almost unparalleled generality humans when subject to an authority will commit the most horrific acts of inhumanity. That statement entails terrorism from an individual recalling his IRA experiences relative to the current actions of terrorist in Syria. 8 How in-group thinking overrides each individual\u2019s mindset and to what extremes the mindsets exist acceptable among its members. Herbert Kerman, professor emeritus of social ethics at Harvard, stated that, \u201cIt is dangerous to assume that it takes a monster to commit a monstrosity.\u201d8 Milgram\u2019s Experiment on Obedience to Authority, conducted in the early 1960\u2019s shows that in the general populous of educators 35% when asked to exist as the instrument of inflicted punishment or pain through electrical shock, refused the command of authority. However more interesting is the 65%, who would under the command of authority, would inflict a greater amount of pain. 9  Nonetheless only 2.5% inflict the maximum amount of voltage or pain to their student in the experiment. Thus in general not all humans exist in the far extreme of actors who commit atrocities and those caught in the percentages in between, exist only willing to act in reaction to their environmental situations. 9  In consideration of acts of terrorism in conjunction with the social science experiments actors of terrorism all exhibit the same main attribute as their rational of joining and committing acts of terror, anger. This anger may stem from multiple or different causalities, such as social, economic or financial hardships, yet the prime attribute exist solely in the emotion of anger.

Ankara\u2019s demands to include a Turkish-trained Sunni force are threatening to fracture an uneasy alliance of diverse Iraqi fighters in what could be a turning point in the war against Islamic State. The Turkish pressure on Baghdad has triggered new demands from influential, rival Shiite militias, which are rethinking their agreement to play a more limited role in the fight for Mosul, according to Iraqi officials\u2014throwing a wrench into delicate negotiations over the battle plan.\"\nosul, historically a prosperous trading hub of 1.5 million people, is the largest city under Islamic State control. The city\u2019s importance has touched off a rivalry between Iraq\u2019s disparate fighting forces. Kurdish and Shiite fighters are jockeying for a role in what is considered the last major battle against the militancy as both seek to expand their political influence across Iraq. And the dispute has devolved into an unusually personal feud between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who traded caustic barbs this week as the U.S. urged the two leaders to set aside their differences and focus on the battle against Islamic State. On Wednesday, Mr. Erdogan vowed to protect Turkey\u2019s Sunni allies in Iraq from \u201cbeing crushed under the wheels of global power games\u201d and warned that sectarian feuds could drown the region in \u201cblood and fire.\u201d The dispute centers on 3,000 Sunni fighters trained by Turkish forces at a base in northern Iraq. In Baghdad, some officials say they believe the Turkish government in Ankara wants to use the Sunni tribal force as a proxy for its own interests in the Mosul offensive, which include protecting ethnic Turkmen in the area and containing the territorial ambitions of Kurdish forces. For nearly a year, Turkey has rebuffed Baghdad\u2019s demands that it pull its own troops out of Iraq. Turkey has trained Iraqi forces in the country\u2019s Kurdish region for years. But last year, Turkey expanded its military presence outside the Kurdish areas near Mosul. Under the current plans, Iraq\u2019s military, backed by other local Sunni forces, is expected to lead the fight for the heart of Mosul, a Sunni majority city. Shiite fighters and Kurdish forces have agreed to secure the surrounding towns, villages and outlying neighborhoods. But now, Shiite militias and their allies in Iraq\u2019s federal police are demanding a larger role if Baghdad allows the Turkish-backed Sunni fighters to join the loose-knit coalition, according to Iraqi officials. One of Iraq\u2019s most influential Shiite militias threatened to attack Turkish troops in Iraq if they don\u2019t pull out. \u201cWe advise Erdogan to come to his senses and withdraw his soldiers before we send them back home in boxes,\u201d the Shiite Badr Organization, which has strong political ties to Iraq\u2019s security apparatus, said Wednesday. Turkey has offered air support during the battle for Mosul, but not ground troops. Two Pentagon officials said privately that they didn\u2019t believe the diplomatic rift would delay the Mosul operation, which is expected to kick off in a week or so.

Turkey\u2019s President Tayyip Erdogan says Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is \u201cinsulting\u201d him for demanding that his unwelcome 2,000 or so troops depart their northern Iraqi training base at Bashiqa. Erdogan told a crowd in Istanbul this morning, \u201cIraq had certain requests from us regarding Bashiqa, and now they are telling us to leave, but the Turkish army has not lost so much standing as to take orders from you\u2026The Iraqi prime minister is insulting me, first know your limits.\u201d Why this is a big deal: \u201cThe Turkish presence is massively destabilizing. Reports Turkey has stepped up its training of [former parliament speaker Osama] Nujayfi\u2019s militia has set off alarm bells,\u201d writes Middle East analyst Kirk Sowell of Utica Risk Services. \u201cThis matters for two reasons. One, these aren\u2019t just random local Ninawa residents. They are the private army of Osama al-Nujayfi. Nujayfi has long ties to Turkey; in 2010, he flipped from Arab nationalist to working with [Masoud] Barzani\u2019s [Kurdistan Democratic Party] because of the policy change in Ankara. Two, this could increase the chance of direct conflict between Baghdad forces and Turkey-backed Sunni forces, or even Turkish forces directly. If Turkey were simply concerned about fighting ISIS, this would be less of a problem. But this is an effort to set of a zone of influence\u2026This also hugely undermines U.S. policy in Iraq, which depends on strengthening Iraqi govt institutions versus Shia militias.\u201d More on his take, here. If it sounds like Ankara has some new pep in its step, note this new Turkey-Russia undersea gas pipeline deal, announced along with other cooperative efforts between the two countries on the conflict in Syria. Elsewhere around Mosul, U.S. special operators and Iraqi troops are conducting more raids closer and closer to the key northern Iraq city, and new Apaches are up around Erbil.

Here's her comment: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/347293 I think whats most important is where exactly these tunnels are located. Are the majority under the city itself, or outside the city? If the tunnels are constructed in the hills southwest of Mosul - an area the Iraqi Army must traverse to approach the city - it may be a long tome before Iraqi troops even enter Mosul. There is only one highway between the Iraqi staging area and the city, so the ISIS defenders know exactly where to position themselves. If they can strike and disappear rapidly, they can hinder Iraqi Army movements and draw out the campaign. There's also this: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/battle-to-banish-islamic-state-from-mosul-could-become-a-mess/2016/10/11/a78d78d2-8a58-11e6-8cdc-4fbb1973b506_story.html Two interesting things: first, \"Under the military agreement, which lays out the plan of attack, only Iraqi special forces, army, police and volunteer fighters from the area will be allowed to enter the city, according to an Iraqi military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Yahya Rasoul. Iraqi troops will be allowed to move through and build up a presence in areas controlled by Kurdistan\u2019s semiautonomous government, and sectors of the battlefield have been assigned to various Iraqi forces.\" So political consideration determine which formations can even enter the city once the approach is complete. I assume that these formations are considered adequate to finish the job, but what if they aren't? If they fail, a new political agreement might have to be cobbled together that permits other forces to complete the operation. And note that the Kurds have given permission for Iraqi Amy troops to operate from Kurdish territory, but there is no mention of Peshmerga forces taking an active role in the offensive. Further down in the article, the author hints that the Pershmerga are viewed with suspicion. I interpret this as meaning that the main effort on all fronts will be made by Iraqi Army troops. These troops have a spotty record of success, except for the Special Forces, who are by definition elite units and tend to be smaller in number than line units. SO are there enough of them to finish the job in the time frame of this question? The second thing that's interesting is on the map of the Washington Post article. On every map I have ever seen of this theater, there is a large area of territory southeast of Mosul that is identified as being held by ISIS. This area is not contiguous with the ISIS enclave in Mosul itself, but it presumably contains some fighters, and during the overall operation someone will have to isolate this area and/or clear it out. We have already seen in Syria that ISIS can disrupt its enemies supply lines for varying periods of time, sometimes a week or more. ISIS fighters operating from this area could conceivably do enough short-term damage to Iraqi supply lines to temporarily stall progress on the approach to Mosul. So overall, even though the operation is likely to begin quite soon, I still consider it unlikely that it will succeed in the next ten weeks or so. In my opinion, it's an open question is the Iraqi Army will even have entered Mosul in that time frame."], [691, "2016-10-12T19:34:47Z", [0.12], ""], [14777, "2016-10-12T18:13:37Z", [0.13], ""], [3225, "2016-10-12T18:11:36Z", [0.5], ""], [1262, "2016-10-12T16:57:18Z", [0.05], "Lack of coordinated effort will delay these efforts http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/10/turkey-erdogan-iraq-prime-minister-place-battle-mosul.html?utm_source=Boomtrain&utm_medium=manual&utm_campaign=20161011&bt_ee=Cm4NW8yvjVrwrSFyRcN0E6W7YcFj6oMFGHYoPrMEbgOtlZxTesQAFIc7r9sEmt2G&bt_ts=1476203292246"], [29541, "2016-10-12T15:45:19Z", [0.8], ""], [2965, "2016-10-12T13:52:25Z", [0.0], "Based on the wording of the previous resolved question ( retake Aleppo) I am still at 0\nAs noted before, it is entirely possible that a spearhead of a battalion could reach the center of Mosul before January 1, 2016.

The former fighters interviewed by Newsweek describe a similarly intricate network of tunnels with rooms, toilets, medical facilities and enough food to sustain a long fight. \"Chillingly, the fighters say the roughly 11,000 men set to defend Mosul have chemical weapons\u2014\u201cchlorine and mustard gas,\u201d according to Waleed Abdullah, a 23-year-old Iraqi who left the battlefield last month. Abdullah believes about 3,000 ISIS soldiers will fight to the death. The rest, he says, will escape\u2014via the tunnels\u2014and, as the North Vietnamese did nearly half a century ago, continue the fight. And contrary to numerous reports of deteriorating morale among the ISIS rank and file, Waleed says that among the hardcore fighters, \u201cmorale is still very high. They will stay underground for a long time since the tunnels are deep and provide the means of life.\"\n. . . \n\"The inability to hold territory creates \u201cISIS 2.0,\u201d as a senior Middle Eastern intelligence official puts it. \u201cIt means that ISIS adapts and begins to look more like Al-Qaeda,\u2019\u2019 . . .  \u201cThey may not be able to maintain the physical caliphate, but they can build and maintain networks,\u201d the intelligence official adds. \". . .  Two key questions going forward will confront the ISIS leadership. \"The first is financial. The methodical rolling up of the caliphate that has been Obama\u2019s strategy for the past two years has undeniably made it more difficult for ISIS to make money. It has degraded ISIS\u2019s access to oil money in both Iraq and Syria, forcing it to turn more to extortion. That, in turn, further alienates populations living under ISIS\u2019s thumb. . . . \"The second issue for Baghdadi and his top lieutenants is one of face: How much does the loss of territory damage the ISIS brand in the eyes of would-be jihadis all over the world? . . .  According to this view, we likely have seen peak ISIS, its ability to pull off significant attacks damaged and the prestige that attended fighting for it seriously eroded. Many U.S. and European counterterrorism officials doubt it will be that simple. Officials concede they are deeply concerned not so much that the numbers of fighters flowing back into the West will increase but about the type of fighters likely to return.  . . . \u201cOne of the risks is that these guys have learned a lot in terms of weaponized chemical stuff, in terms of using car bombs. I hope this knowledge will not be used here, but we have to be vigilant.\u201d . . . in the past two years, ISIS has sent more than 300 \u201csleepers\u201d from the region to different Western nations. \u201cThey first go to Turkey, where they get a fake passport,\u201d and then slip out individually via varying routes to the West. . . . \n. . . \n\". . .  the strategy to defeat ISIS amounts to \u201crubble-izing\u201d predominantly Sunni cities in Iraq and Syria. \u201cEighty percent of Ramadi was destroyed. Half of Fallujah was destroyed.   \u201cAre we really defeating ISIS? There are 20 million Arab Sunnis in the northern Middle East\u2014350,000 military-age young men in Mosul alone\u2014all asking [the United States], \u2018What are you doing ?\u2019\u201d ISIS, remember, arose in Iraq largely in reaction to the strident sectarian leadership of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite who, once the U.S. bugged out in 2009, set about purging Sunnis from the military and senior positions in the Iraqi government. Many Sunnis believe the U.S. has effectively thrown in with Iran and the Shiite militias in Iraq to defeat ISIS. The former Iraqi Baathist intelligence and military officials who make up ISIS\u2019s leadership under Baghdadi know that despite the loss of territory, those disaffected young men are ripe for recruiting. The same is true in Syria, where some 400,000 Sunnis (and counting) have died in that country\u2019s civil war, for which there is no end in sight now that the cease-fire negotiated by the U.S. and Russia has quickly fallen apart. The sectarian chaos only increases. Shiite militias from Iraq have been deployed in Syria to fight Sunni rebel groups, including ISIS but also including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front) and Ahrar al-Sham\u2014both of which have been active in defending the besieged city of Aleppo from Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian forces. Through such actions, the Sunni groups have \u201csecured [their] place in the hearts and minds of the Syrian people,\u201d according to a recent intelligence report viewed by Newsweek . \" . . .under Zawahiri\u2019s stewardship, Al-Qaeda also grew its largest paramilitary force ever\u2014in Syria alone, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham has 10,000 fighters loyal to it. And it has slowly but surely expanded its footprint globally, in the Levant (Greater Syria) region, the Indian subcontinent and West and North Africa. \"Doctrinal and strategic differences\u2014as well as big egos, intelligence officials say\u2014keep Al-Qaeda and ISIS from joining forces, and that does not appear set to change anytime soon.  . . . But . .  . \u201cAl-Qaeda also has more resources at its disposal today than ever, and more geographic reach.\u201d  . . .  in many respects it is beginning to seem like old times in Afghanistan, with the Taliban ascendant on the battlefield and Al-Qaeda still joined at the hip with once and perhaps future rulers there.\n. . . \n\"The defining feature of the West\u2019s war against radical Islamic militants has been its constant shape-shifting; at times, it can seem like whack-a-mole\u2014enemies are killed, others pop up. The fortunes of the opposition wax and\u2014in the case of ISIS now\u2014wane, as they figure out new ways to attack. ISIS, now degraded, as Obama vowed, will necessarily be in transition but perhaps no less lethal. Al-Qaeda is expanding, patiently, and still has ambitions for large-scale attacks in the West, at a time and place of its choosing. The war grinds on. In early 2013, on his last day as acting head of the CIA, Michael Morell told Obama, who came to office wanting to end wars, \u201cMy children\u2019s generation and my grandchildren\u2019s generation will still be fighting this fight.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The meat of this article for this question is in the first 2 paragraphs, about the sophistication of the tunnels and the morale of the fighters in Mosul.

Concerns also remain that fighting in Mosul will provoke a sprawling humanitarian crisis with up to one million people internally displaced in Iraq.\nMcGurk acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying that while not all details of a transition after the battle have been finalized, the approach in place has worked \u201corganically\u201d in other Iraqi cities retaken from the Islamic State.

But the future is fraught with dangers Fear of a free-for-all Iraq has a plethora of other armed groups, able to draft in well over 100,000 men, who might improve the coalition\u2019s odds substantially. But an influx of Kurdish or Shia militias risks not only alienating Mosul\u2019s large Sunni Arab population but increasing the prospect that they might fight each other to determine the city\u2019s post-IS order. Mr. Abadi seems sensibly intent on restricting the Kurds\u2019 Peshmerga (\u201cthose who confront death\u201d)and the Shias\u2019 Hashd al-Shaabi (\u201cpopular mobilisation forces\u201d) to laying a siege on the city\u2019s outskirts. That would bring them financial benefits, since checkpoints are lucrative. And lest that prove insufficient, the government is also hoping to divert the Shia militias by having them launch an assault on two nearby towns under IS control, Hawijah and Tel Afar.\nThe Iraqi army\u2019s preferred backups are two Sunni irregular forces. Sadly, both are fierce rivals. The first is led by Atheel al-Nujaifi, Mosul\u2019s former governor, whose family has held sway in the city since Ottoman times. Based in Kurdistan, his 5,000 armed men work closely with the Peshmerga and are trained by the Turks. The second group comes from south of Mosul and is drawn largely from the Jabouri tribe. It works closely with Mr. Abadi\u2019s lot and has contrived to replace Mr. Nujaifi as Mosul\u2019s governor and his brother as parliament\u2019s speaker with their own people, both Jabouris.

As always, we are confronted with the discrepancy between the formal narrative and the informal (yet real) facts on the ground. Most people accept the formal number without thinking, and those that do know the truth accept the informal number with a wink and a nod. So, the statement that \"there will soon be 5,000 American troops in Iraq\" is false, for on any given day there are likely some number closer to 10,000. This is approximately the same number that the U.S. currently has garrisoned in Afghanistan, protecting the record-setting production of the poppie industry. Earlier today I watched an interview with CIA Director Brennan where he laments at the time ISIS has to plot and scheme to develop future attacks that they will deliver to the West. If ISIS is a serious threat, and they are, then the entire nonchalant approach to taking them out makes no sense. Why have they been allowed to continue? As the tracking of jihadist fighters in Mosul has attempted to show, this a relatively small group of thugs that a concerted effort could have eliminated years ago. One American division, or the composite equivalent of international forces, focused exclusively on Mosul, could have liberated that city years ago. Overall, the cost to American taxpayers would have been TRILLIONS less, and those future dangers Brennan so confidently forecasts would never have had the time to be hatched. So why the delay? ISIS must, therefore, in this crazy, mixed up world of informal geopolitics, be serving some function by being allowed to continue. The world is being played. Even the most oblivious among us sometimes see that things just don't seem to make sense. They begin to mumble and groan that maybe there's something wrong with the narrative the public has been spoon-fed. Well, our dear friend Senator Ron Johnson is now scratching his head: \u201cIt took us four years to defeat Nazi Germany and imperial Japan,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cAre you telling me that America can\u2019t lead an effort to actually accomplish the destruction of a caliphate that is basically run by tens of thousands of ISIS operatives?\u201d\nhttp://freebeacon.com/national-security/anti-isis-coalition-america-not-leading-enough/ But I don't expect that Ron will go beyond just articulating his initial observation on the absurdity of the situation. This is sad because we're left with \"arguments\" in the abstract about micro issues (in Go terms, the local phenomena) when we're missing the reality of the macro issues (in Go terms, the global phenomena). In life, in reality, the macro issues swamp the micro issues, and if we're not dealing with such root causes we're condemning ourselves to perpetual maladaptation. Don't tell me about ISIS plotting for future bomb attacks if you have been instrumental in maintaining them as a thriving organization Mr. Brennan. And don't tell me about the horrific deaths of citizens and children in Aleppo if you have initiated and fomented the war that started it Ms. Power."], [15196, "2016-09-29T04:42:56Z", [0.25], ""], [4729, "2016-09-29T03:44:03Z", [0.15], ""], [73, "2016-09-29T03:35:25Z", [0.99], ""], [1218, "2016-09-29T00:14:22Z", [0.5], ""], [4273, "2016-09-28T23:45:21Z", [0.07], ""], [368, "2016-09-28T21:36:20Z", [0.0], ""], [14253, "2016-09-28T20:55:32Z", [0.15], ""], [38, "2016-09-28T20:46:34Z", [0.21], "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/09/26/pentagon-now-expects-isis-to-use-mustard-gas-in-mosul-fight.html \"In addition to U.S. troops having access to gas masks and MOPP gear . . .the U.S. has distributed more than 50,000 kits of personal protective gear for Iraqi and Kurdish forces. \"In the Mosul offensive, American advisers are expected to move closer to the battlefront. The Defense Department has authorized U.S. commanders to place advisers with the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish peshmerga at the battalion level. \"In his briefing last Friday, [Army Col] Dorrian said eight to 12 brigades of the Iraqi Security Forces were \"ready to go\" against Mosul, where ISIS has had nearly two years to build up defenses. The U.S. estimates that the group \"no longer is able to mass enough forces to stop the advance\" on the city, and its fighters are experiencing \"flagging morale\" from the loss of territory and the unrelenting coalition airstrikes. . . . . U.S. airstrikes recently destroyed an estimated 29 ISIS boats on the Tigris River and also blew up a bridge over which the group's vehicles were attempting to escape, he said. \"To defend Mosul, ISIS has built \"intricate defenses,\" including elaborate tunnel networks and interconnected layers of improvised explosive devices along likely \"avenues of approach\" to the city, Dorrian said. The U.S. has also seen reports that ISIS has dug trenches and filled them with oil to be set on fire once the offensive begins. \"They've built a hell on earth around themselves,\" he said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm wondering how many of the 50k kits of personal protective gear have made their way to the Kurds, and I'm not sure that I believe (though I'd like to) Dorrian's assessment that ISIS morale in Mosul is flagging.   I am reminded of the reports from Vietnam;  everyone US or Vietnamese soldiers killed was, by definition, \"VC\".  In this instance,  how do we know that everyone killed by Iraqi, rebel or coalition forces are \"ISIS\"?  And how do we know who was in those 29 boats or vehicles attempting to escape Mosul?   I'm no military historian, but it seems to me that military-types always tell the story in a way to make themselves seem victorious, when the reality could be quite the opposite:  maybe all those people were innocent civilians.  What hard facts do we really have about the forces in Mosul, and their morale?   This is one of those questions in which there are unknowns of all sorts:  known, unknown, and assumed--both correctly and incorrectly.   It seems to me that when there's a lot of unknowns, there is a great potential for things to not go as planned--both for the better and for the worse.  It's possible Mosul will fall in short order, OR become a very long bloody battle. The later the offensive is launched, the less likely that this question will resolve as \"yes\" because there would be insufficient time for even the best-case scenario.

The new deployment, if approved by the White House, would assist Iraqi and coalition forces in preparing for the battle to capture the northern city, the extremist group\u2019s last major stronghold in Iraq. That fight is expected to begin as early as mid-October, U.S. officials have said.   The U.S. move would come in the wake of an operation that began Tuesday by Iraqi forces in Shirqat, a town north of Baghdad, to further degrade Islamic State supply lines into Mosul. That operation, which was announced by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in New York, where he is participating in U.N. General Assembly meetings, is a further indication that the Iraqi forces are preparing for the larger fight in Mosul, a city of about one million people. The new U.S. forces would increase the number of American personnel officially deployed to Iraq from 4,400 to about 4,900. The Pentagon also maintains up to 1,500 additional U.S. forces that it doesn\u2019t acknowledge as part of its Iraq force, most at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad or on temporary assignments. The new deployment would bring the overall U.S. presence to as high as 6,400. The 500 would be in addition to roughly 400 new personnel the U.S. sent to Iraq in early September to prepare for the Mosul offensive. President Barack Obama hasn\u2019t yet been presented with the military plan, according to U.S. officials. The White House maintains that the troops the Pentagon sends to Iraq aren\u2019t heading into direct combat. Rather, U.S. officials have said, those troops are there in an advise-and-assist mission. While they are armed and always have the authority to defend themselves on the battlefield, they aren\u2019t performing direct action missions, officials have said repeatedly. Advise-and-assist forces operate under instructions to remain \u201cone terrain feature\u201d behind any battle, meaning they must stay some distance behind the front lines of fighting and serve only in an advisory role. However, there have been instances in which U.S. troops have been killed or injured while operating under these strict guidelines. Most of the new troops would be assigned to an area the U.S. military has established south of Mosul at a logistics hub known as \u201cQ-West\u201d near the city of Qayara. Hundreds of U.S. and coalition forces have massed there in the past several months in anticipation of the Mosul fight. The same base was the target this week of what U.S. officials said was a rocket or mortar fired by Islamic State fighters, and containing a mustard agent, into the perimeter of the base where U.S. service members are deployed, senior defense officials confirmed Wednesday. The weapon was described as \u201ccrude\u201d and ineffective. No U.S. personnel were injured in the Tuesday attack. But the incident marked the first time Islamic State had deployed a weapon containing a mustard agent against U.S. forces, defense officials said. The attack resulted in no change in security posture, defense officials said. Islamic State has used weapons with a mustard agent about two dozen times. They typically have been used against Iraqi or Peshmerga forces or Iraqi civilians, officials said. The fight for Mosul\u2014seen as the biggest battle yet against Islamic State\u2014has been delayed for more than a year. The U.S. military has hinted at different times the effort would begin. Mr. Abadi recently has signaled he wants the city taken by the end of the year. In recent months, U.S. officials also have said that the Iraqi military appears ready to take the lead in the fight and as recently as two weeks ago said they expected Iraqi and coalition forces to enter the city sometime in October. U.S. military officials have said it is unclear what kind of fight they will find once inside Mosul. Gen. Joe Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command, said last month there may be areas Islamic State decides to cede to coalition forces immediately, and others in which it decides to fight to the death. \u201cThey are going to have to make hard decisions about where they\u2019re going to concentrate their power and where they\u2019re going to have to let the coalition and our indigenous partners succeed, and that\u2019s kind of what I see going forward,\u201d Gen. Votel said at the Pentagon on Aug. 30. Separately, the White House is considering steps in Syria to more directly arm the Kurdish forces it has been supporting there. That decision would help to focus the so-called YPG, which may be the primary force behind the retaking of the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the militant group\u2019s caliphate. U.S. officials have been discussing ways to help prepare the YPG for that fight, and the YPG has sought more direct assistance from Washington in the form of more small arms, ammunition and possibly some non-lethal assistance like trucks or medical equipment. Up until now, the U.S. has only indirectly armed Kurdish forces, seen as the most effective in the fight against Islamic State, by equipping the Syrian Democratic Forces, which include Arabs who are closely aligned with Kurdish forces. The U.S. has provided numerous ammunition drops to the SDF as a fig leaf for its quieter support of the Kurds there, U.S. officials have said. The move likely would anger Turkey, which believes the Kurds seek a semi-autonomous state along its border inside Syria and equates military assistance to the YPG with helping the Kurds take a step closer to that end\"."], [2965, "2016-09-22T13:07:57Z", [1.0], " POTUS sends 400 more and reports there is no  agreed plan of attack chosen and states that attack into Mosul will occur around 10-15.

The vote was held by a secret ballot in a vote of 158 to 77. The Iraqi Constitution (Article 61.8.A) mandates that a minister be dismissed on the basis of an absolute majority, which is 165 CoR members.The vote was rendered therefore in a simple majority, the same method that the CoR dismissed Defense Minister Khalid al-Obeidi on August 25.CoR Speaker Salim al-Juburi denied a request from 102 CoR members for re-vote on whether to proceed from the questioning session, held on August 25, to a vote of no-confidence. Juburi also denied a request from Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi to postpone the no-confidence vote. PM Abadi argued that Zebari is critical to Iraq's ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) regarding major international loan agreements. Juburi likewise denied a request from 50 CoR members to postpone the vote.\n\nThe Kurdistan Alliance has effectively collapsed, due intra-Kurdish tensions in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) that spilled into politics in Baghdad. Kurdish political parties have varying interests in Arbil, but they have historically agreed to present a unified platform in Baghdad in order to exact concession for the KRG. However, tensions between Zebari's party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), and a Kurdish opposition party, Gorran, in the KRG have escalated and now affect politics in Baghdad. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) has split loyalties in the dispute, and this internal fracture has failed to prevent the vote from succeeding. Early reports suggest that most non-KDP Kurdish CoR members voted to dismiss Zebari, likely in order to punish the KDP. The KDP issued a statement calling the dismissal a \"violation of the Constitution and the law.\" The fracture of the Kurdistan Alliance will deprive all Kurdish parties their ability to influence politics in the Iraqi Government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's shadow party, the Reform Front, spearheaded the vote, as it did for Defense Minister Khalid al-Obeidi. Maliki hit on fault lines in the Kurdistan Alliance in order to benefit his own interests. Maliki is seeking allies that can support a bid for the premiership and has repeatedly courted the PUK and Gorran to join his support base. He is also targeting ministers who are key allies for PM Abadi in an effort to undermine Abadi's premiership.\n\nISW has previously assessed the implications of Zebari's dismissal. These include:\n\nZebari dismissal could compromise ongoing financial negotiations that are critical for Iraq's economic stability. This includes ongoing discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are scheduled to resume in Washington, D.C., in early October. Zebari has been instrumental for obtaining the $5.3 billion standby loan. His absence may prevent Iraq from unlocking greater loan amounts and addressing Iraq's overall financial crisis.\nThe U.S. campaign for Mosul could suffer if the KDP and Baghdad, two of the U.S.'s major ground partners, no longer have an effective relationship. The breakdown of relations between the KDP and the Iraqi Government may complicate the current plan and timeline for Mosul. The majority of anti-ISIS operations in northern Iraq have occurred in KDP-governed terrain and alongside KDP-Peshmerga, who will be the primarily Peshmerga force to participate in Mosul operations, which are intended to launch in the upcoming months. The KDP made \"historic\" agreements with Baghdad on September 19 over coordination and force composition in the Mosul operations. If the KDP rejects the oversight of the federal government, or if the U.S.'s ability to work with the KDP is hampered by poor Baghdad-Arbil relations, the timeline or success of the Mosul operations may suffer. The KDP may also use poor relations with Baghdad to rebuff plans for the post-ISIS administration of Mosul that do not include Kurdish governance. The KDP may also push to expand Kurdish territory outside of the KRG's boundaries.\nMaliki and the Reform Front may ultimate target PM Abadi with a no-confidence vote. Maliki and the Reform Front has now successfully engineered the unconstitutional removal of two ministers, putting the survival of any minister in the Iraqi Government at stake. Zebari and Defense Minister Obeidi were two of PM Abadi's important allies in the Iraqi Government. Maliki's ability to remove PM Abadi's allies and gain support for himself could prompt a call for a dismissal of PM Abadi. Without the support of the Kurdish and Sunni parties, PM Abadi may have insufficient support to ensure he survives the vote.\nThe split between the Kurdish parties jeopardizes a push for Kurdish independence because an independence referendum would require the support of all Kurdish parties. An independent Iraqi Kurdistan without the PUK-governed territories - primarily the oil-rich Kirkuk Province - is not financially viable. The PUK, which controls half of the Kurdish territories, may block attempts by the KDP to declare independence because the move would be spearheaded by KRG President Masoud Barzani and the KDP. Kurdish independence is less likely, though Barzani will escalate calls for a referendum. However the KDP could still withdraw from Iraqi Government. This will further remove an obstacle for Maliki to gain overarching influence in the CoR and move to retake the premiership"], [691, "2016-09-21T18:59:24Z", [0.48], ""], [51, "2016-09-21T18:52:16Z", [0.25], ""], [4273, "2016-09-21T18:17:43Z", [0.08], ""], [684, "2016-09-21T17:13:14Z", [0.05], ""], [14182, "2016-09-21T17:05:29Z", [0.04], "Down 1 from 5 to 4%.

The variables of having either incomplete military dossiers or, imprecise data on what type of inhabitants within quadrants in or around Mosul are immense. As the facts change on the ground over the next period of time, so too will these probability variables. More specifically, does Peshmerga have complete knowledge of the Iranian led Popular Mobilization Force movements? Are \nOVER EXTENDED Iraqi Forces allowed unlimited access to Mosul's theater of battle or, must they share responsibility w/ Shiite militias who have claimed they will enter Mosul as well...in spite of Mosul Sunni rebels that refuse to recognize... Shiite military existence. Who will be allowed to battle within the City limits, & how the fight will play out ? Nor, do we know w/ reasonable certainty the humanitarian/ethnic push back consequences of a RECLAIMING/RETAKING of Mosul.  Careful past facto analysis of Fallujah & Aleppo has hopefully taught us as much. Both al Abadi & Assad have 0-1% interest in managing the risks associated with their attempted retaking of politically important cities  such as Aleppo & Mosul. Thus, where the uncertainties remain difficult to reduce, cautious judgement, remains reasonable. It compels a low probability forecast under these circumstances.   NB: since LAST update, thirty (30) days ago, there has been virtually NO substantive MILITARY action w/in the parameters of Mosul, as expected. There are now slightly over ninety days (90)  left for this question to resolve an extremely complex calculation! Yet, a review of Middle East,EU & US media continue to push reports MOSUL will at best, fall as QUICKLY as it was taken over by ISIL, or at worst, in line with Iraq Government statements of year end victory. Even US General Votel, Head of U.S. forces in the Middle East makes the case Mosul will be retaken by year end. http://tmsnrt.rs/2bGrvdS Another typical example:  POLITICO Get Ready For Obama's October Surprise.\nhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/iraq-offensive-2016-mosul-islamic-state-isis-isil-obama-foreign-policy-kurdish-214121 NB: the facts in the US for example show that if, embarrassingly, a PRESIDENTIAL candidate G. Johnson can be thrown off guard to look uninformed in a public broadcast interview on Aleppo issues, how then, can the average American know or even care,  about MOSUL?  In point of fact, for the average American - WHAT & WHERE Mosul is & what is stands for, is arguably - factually irrelevant for the American voter. A. POLITICS DECISIVE! WEAK CENTRAL COMMAND CENTER.\n\nThe controlling  element for \"retaking\" Mosul w/in the timeline of this Q is the political NOT, the military component.  During this past thirty day (30) period although there has been NO military push into Mosul there has , however,  been clear & compelling  POLITICAL  direct & circumstantial evidence the embattled PM al Abadi in Bagdad, retains AT BEST  an extremely WEAK Central Command Center SUBSEQUENT to, the recent ouster &  no confidence vote of his Minister of Defense Khalid al-Obedi. Former PM al- Maki has made clear his intentions &, now has increased Iranian support in his endeavor to unseat al Abadi. (** FN1) For example,**** Iraqi  (Kurdish) Finance  Minister Hoshyar Zebari. Iraqi Parliment today voted to sack him as well. http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2016/09/21/Correspondent-Iraqi-parliament-votes-to-sack-finance-minister-Hoshyar-Zebari-.html ****Zabari  HAD for the past three weeks been forced to  FEND off a vote of NO CONFIDENCE  as well this month for various reasons ( not a sufficient quorum b/c of Muslim holidays). Whether Zebari makes good on his recent counter attack  w/ the argument that ...SHOULD BE OUSTED which is now a fact ... he will take down others with him  - presently unidentifiable high Iraqi Council of Representatives officials - which he alleges have been involved in graft and misappropriation of funds provided by Coalition Forces for Iraq military & economic development  ( read US). (FN1) (**) This political chaos is - critical to the military component because - without a STRONG Central Command Center (ONE undisputed leader within the various competing interests), BAGDAD has a pre-programmed &, extremely high probability (>90%) of loss of military control on battle field grounds of MOSUL. (2)  B. MASSIVE FIREPOWER, BUT WHO RECLAIMS WHAT IN MOSUL?\n\nThis political fracturing in Bagdad has created a - fundamentally weak Command Central center - for the Mosul battle. Whether the Kurdish political Alliance w/in Iraq's Ruling Government can remain effective is clearly an open question. (2)  Logically, an uncertain political environment is also an open invitation for various  military forces already positioned on the ground near Mosul to directly & indirectly OPENLY DISPUTE Bagdad's fundamental course of action.  Consider the serious implications of this military fact relative to the various geopolitical forces on the ground for the moment. Especially for al-Abadi. The conclusion is clear.  For example, leading Shiite military commanders are already advising Peshmerga forces to protect their own borders (3) whereas Kurdish leading commanders are essentially telling the Shiite commander \" to STUFF  it\" (4).  RECALL also that Peshmerga answers exclusively to President Barzani KRG not PM al Abadi. Additionally, the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMC) respond in military terms to Iranian Commander Qasem Soleimani.  Iraqi Forces are at the very least subject to & respond to al Abadi, & various international forces led by US Command. (5) Fascinating...... NB: al Abadi is neither beholden to .....nor required to ....comply w/ US Command recommendations. Yet, IRAQ HAS THE ENVIABLE option to TAKE US fund support but must... NOT... comply w/ US recommendations.  AND IF THIS COMPLEXITY, were not enough, ERDOGAN in Turkey has made clear his demand to ALSO play an important role in Mosul! (6) Erdogan's distrust of PKK & Shiite Militias @ the expense of local Turkmams & the Peshmergas. On the other hand, al Abadi, has made clear Iraq does not want Turkish troops in Mosul (7) Therefore, this combination of a weak central command in Bagdad, along with Iraqi,  Kurdish, Iranian, Turkish, various Militia & Coalition Forces guarantees very low probability  (< 5%) of being properly managed in the first instance. Risk management controls in the second instance are at if not close to zero (0). UNINTENDED consequences within the Central Command area, are logically &, clearly foreseeable when ONE HAS ANY DEGREE OF RISK MANAGEMENT concern.  WHAT they are, is an open question.  Finally, what  are the probabilities of various forces directly battling each other within the parameters of Mosul ? Each have fundamentally conflicting interests for their \"RETAKING\" of some part of Mosul albeit they have are using ISIL as common grounds to extract from this battle their own particular political interests. And therein lies the rub with this Mosul dilemma.  C. IS IT HEADS IS IT TAILS? LETS FLIP A COIN! How significantly reduced are Iraqi forces? How deeply embedded within the various regions of Mosul are ISIL fighters? Will it be the over stretched Iraqi Forces that push into Mosul? Will it be PMC that attempts to reclaim portions of southern Mosul? Will Shiite rebels be nice to Mosul Sunni tribal members while ferreting out imbedded ISIL fighters in urban conflict ? A random flip of the coin ? The inherent uncertainty in this process -  - - imagine the child running towards the solider on the battle torn streets - - - is the child LOADED with a detonating devise or, is it just running towards the soldier out of fear or for help while screaming something unintelligible? HOLLYWOOD makes movies like this? It's happening in Aleppo.  Why can't this occur in Mosul ? The PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS with the underlying variables, in the heat of war, are arguably irreducible.  How many ISIL remain in Mosul? 2K, 20K, 30K?  Has ISIL instead recruited foreign fighters? Are chemical attacks possible ? Are kids now being recruited by ISIL capable of becoming weapons of battle?  Instructive on these issues are Sources (8), (9), (10) (11). D. CONCLUSION: The only certainty in this Mosul military campaign is that it has developed into a polarized structure of competing interests. Iraq PM al-Abadi stands under intense political pressure. Iraqi forces remain over stretched. The remaining weeks & months do hold open the possibility but, not a high probability of a clear cut retaking of Mosul before 1/1/17. Critical thinking requires straight forward Questions such as whether Iraq's PM has in political fact & military practice lost full  & effective control of the battle field theater in Mosul?   When viewed from the above-mentioned detailed perspective, this is reasonable and justified question. Adding up the sum of all these parts provides well over a 70% probability al Abadi has indeed lost critical control.    However, as a result of his previous declarations to RETAKE MOSUL before year end, he is nonetheless FORCED politically to commence this assault no later than October. He must be seen to be doing \"something\"! Importantly, forcing a such a retaking at too early a stage of development to survive politically, will have multiple negative consequences for all parties involved.  The substantial uncertainty that accompanies this attack along with,  the clear lack of risk management measures taken, assures unintended consequences on the one hand and, substantially increases the the complex uncertainties on the other hand.

Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \"Our job is to actually help the Iraqis generate the forces and the support necessary for operations in Mosul and we'll be ready for that in October,\" Dunford told a small group of reporters traveling with him.\n\"The noose is gradually tightening around Mosul,\" he added.\nThe city, Iraq's second-largest, is ISIS' last significant stronghold in the country. It and Syria's Raqqa -- the group's self-declared capital -- are the major targets left for the US-led coalition to take back from its control.\nDunford's statement is the clearest sign from a senior US military official that the military battle for Mosul could soon begin once the Iraqis make the political decision to proceed. It also means the battle for Mosul may be raging during the US presidential election, with US forces facing dangers on the battlefield. Those troops might also be called upon to help begin providing humanitarian aid.\nDunford, along with Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. Both are expected to face stiff questioning from Republicans on the panel about the Obama administration's strategy to fight ISIS.\nCNN has learned the Pentagon is now considering setting up new remote bases well outside Mosul as hubs from which US forces can operate.\nThose types of bases, given their locations, are likely to be less secure than the large bases the US has generally been using. They could be used by US military advisers who are expected to work with the Iraqis in the field.\nBecause of the remote locations, security may be difficult. US forces may move \"in and out\" of the bases rather than locate there consistently, one official said. These bases are in addition to the large Iraqi base south of Mosul at Qayyarah, where hundreds of US troops are already located to assist with supplies, logistics and support for the Iraqi forces.\nA key decision to be made is whether additional US conventional and special operations forces will be needed for ensuring the Iraqis succeed, several US defense official told CNN. The US forces will not be on the front lines but will be out in the field with Iraqi units, officials said.\nSome forces already in Iraq could be reassigned to northern Iraq, or additional forces could be sent.\nPresident Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's meeting in New York Monday also signaled the Mosul operation may soon unfold.\n\"We feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly,\" Obama said. Calling Mosul a \"challenging battle,\" Obama also noted that the US will be \"prepared to help provide rapid humanitarian assistance\" to displaced Iraqis.\nAbadi underscored the urgency.\n\"We hope within the next few months we're going to kick Daesh out of Mosul and we'll deliver a huge blow to what Daesh believes in,\" said Abadi, using another name for the terrorist group\" http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/iraq-mosul-isis/index.html\nAll my stated  metrics back in February met.

In June 2014, the jihadist group overran Qayyarah air base and the village surrounding it, which lie just 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of Mosul. Though Iraqi troops retook the base July 9 after launching a protracted ground attack from Baghdad, satellite imagery taken Sept. 13 shows the tremendous damage that Islamic State fighters managed to inflict on the base's facilities before they were forced to retreat. By employing scorched earth tactics at one of the bases used to support the coming operation against Mosul, the group likely hoped to slow the coalition advancing on its positions in and around the city. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the operation to retake Mosul will begin in October as originally planned. Beyond restoring Qayyarah air base's facilities and capabilities, the anti-Islamic State coalition still needs to concentrate a sizable force near Mosul. But debates on the use of largely Shiite popular mobilization units and Turkey's role in the fight have stalled preparations for the offensive, in all likelihood pushing it to the end of the year. In the meantime, officials in Baghdad will have to contend with the fact that the air base was not the only part of Qayyarah to be demolished; the Islamic State also torched the village's oil fields. They are by no means the largest oil fields in Iraq, and their temporary loss will not deal a significant blow to Baghdad's revenue. Coupled with the damage to the air base, though, it could be a chilling sign of what lies in store for Iraq: As the Islamic State loses ground, it is making a concerted effort to ensure that its opponents cannot use the land or resources it leaves behind.\" Appears Mosul Battalions are active.

Also, however, there is a new signal as to some delay in the overall timetable (\"the Iraqis may not be fully ready to move until early November\"), which seems negative.

Coalition planes destroy ISIS chemical factory near Mosul\nhttp://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/217749 To my mind the proffered reason that this facility was bombed out of existence (\"the production center ...  likely made chlorine or mustard gas\") is so tenuous that, if we only take a few moments to stop and think about it, *everything* gets called into question. The production of chlorine gas, if ISIS is so committed, is so easy that an industrial facility is not required for the purpose. Yet, an industrial facility is just that, something that provides industrial efficiencies at scale.  So, what's really going on here is that some industrial facility which likely provided feedstocks to some innumerable number of applications, from sanitation to fertilizers to paints, whatever, you name it, has been destroyed. In short, there's something else going on in Iraq: it's industrial infrastructure is being eliminated. The role of the U.S. rocket artillery, and the recently announced French ground artillery, are along the same lines. These are not tactics necessary for the defeat of ISIS jihadist fighters. These are tactics employed to destroy the industrial base of the surviving inhabitants of that land. These are tactics that evidence a desire to place future inhabitants into a position of dependence. These tactics have nothing to do with fighting ISIS. We are conversant with the colloquial term \"over-kill.\" We think we know what that means. Think of the concept of \"over-destruction.\" Now add the difference in motivation from blood lust, or whatever you think could apply to a condition of over-kill, and think of various motives for over-destruction. Some set of these are at play.

We will go to Tel Afar, they will go to Baaj,\u201d said Jabouri, referring to IS-controlled districts 70km and 140km west of Mosul, respectively, which can be used to reach Syria. \u201cWe will go to Baaj, maybe. It depends on the situation in Syria. They can get to Syria but the situation there is not like before.

An Italian team is helping efforts to repair the dam before it collapses.\" If this is true, and this is \"the biggest attack ever conceived by the Caliphate\" it seems to me pretty obvious that ISIS wants to take control of the dam in order to insure against an attack by Iraqi and/or Kurdish forces.

COMPETING VISIONS FOR SYRIA AND IRAQ: THE MYTH OF AN ANTI-ISIS GRAND COALITION Download the PDF\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute conducted an intensive multi-week planning exercise to frame, design, and evaluate potential courses of action that the United States could pursue to defeat the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) and al Qaeda in Iraq and Syria. ISW and CTP will publish the findings of this exercise in multiple reports. The first report examined America\u2019s global grand strategic objectives as they relate to the threat from ISIS and al Qaeda.[1] This second report defines American strategic objectives in Iraq and Syria, identify the minimum necessary conditions for ending the conflicts there, and compare U.S. objectives with those of Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia in order to understand actual convergences and divergences. The differences mean that the U.S. cannot rely heavily on international partners to achieve its objectives. Subsequent reports will provide a detailed assessment of the situation on the ground in Syria and present the planning group\u2019s evaluation of several courses of action. The key findings of this second report are: The U.S. must accomplish four strategic objectives in Iraq and Syria to achieve vital national interests and secure its people: 1) destroy enemy groups; 2) end the communal, sectarian civil wars; 3) set conditions to prevent the reconstitution of enemy groups; and 4) extricate Iraq and Syria from regional and global conflicts.\nAny American strategy must take urgent measures to strengthen Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi and prepare contingency efforts for his fall. The collapse of the Abadi government and return of his predecessor Nuri al Maliki would be disastrous for the fight against ISIS.\nOngoing international negotiations within the Vienna Framework are bypassing essential requirements for long-term success in Syria. Re-establishing a stable, unitary Syrian state that secures American interests requires the U.S. and its partners to 1) destroy ISIS, Jabhat al Nusra, and foreign Salafi-jihadi groups in Syria; 2) identify and strengthen interlocutors representing the Syrian opposition; 3) facilitate a negotiated settlement between the Syrian regime and opposition; 4) obtain regional acceptance of that settlement; 5) establish peace-enforcement mechanisms; and 6) reconstruct state institutions.\nThe Salafi-jihadi militant base in Syria poses a threat to the U.S., but the U.S. must not simply attack it because that would put the U.S. at war with many Sunnis who must be incorporated into a future, post-Assad inclusive government. The U.S. must separate reconcilable from irreconcilable elements. These other Salafi-jihadi groups must meet the following conditions essential for core U.S. security objectives in order to participate: break with Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS; accept the principle of a future pluralistic and unitary Syrian state; reject violent jihad; commit to disarming to a policing and defensive level; and commit to the elimination of the current shari\u2019a court system and the establishment of political institution-based governance.\nThe superficial convergence of Iranian, Russian, Turkish, and Saudi strategic objectives with those of the U.S. on ISIS as a threat masks significant divergences that will undermine U.S. security requirements. Iran and Russia both seek to reduce and eliminate U.S. influence in the Middle East and are not pursuing strategies that will ultimately defeat al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria or Iraq. Turkey\u2019s support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups, some linked to al Qaeda, stem from the ruling party\u2019s intent to reestablish itself as an independent, Muslim, regional power. Finally, Saudi Arabia\u2019s objectives remain shaped by perceived existential threats from Iran and a growing succession crisis, causing key divergences, especially over support to Salafi-jihadi groups. The U.S. must lead efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria and cannot outsource them to partners.\" In short, as there is no agreement between US and its coalition partners about a future for Iraq or Mosul, there can be no final assault unless Shiite miltias out of the picture. http://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/new-report-series-us-grand-strategy-destroying-isis-and-al-qaeda-0\nEW REPORT SERIES--U.S. GRAND STRATEGY: DESTROYING ISIS AND AL QAEDA\nMar 14, 2016 - John Lawrence The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project (CTP) at the American Enterprise Institute conducted an intensive multi-week planning exercise to frame, design, and evaluate potential courses of action that the United States could pursue to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham (ISIS) and al Qaeda in Iraq and Syria. ISW and CTP are publishing the findings of this exercise in multiple reports in a series titled U.S Grand Strategy: Destroying ISIS and al Qaeda.

The second \u2013 Competing Visions for Syria and Iraq:  The Myth of an Anti-ISIS Grand Coalition -- defines American strategic objectives in Iraq and Syria, identifies the minimum necessary conditions for ending the conflicts there, and compares U.S. objectives with those of Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia in order to understand actual convergences and divergences. The third report -- Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS:  Sources of Strength -- assesses the strengths and vulnerabilities of ISIS and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra to serve as the basis for developing a robust and comprehensive strategy to destroy them. Subsequent reports will provide a detailed assessment of the situation on the ground in Syria and present the planning group\u2019s evaluation of several courses of action.

Attacking the source of ISIS\u2019s strength \u2014 its territorial caliphate \u2014 is relatively straightforward to describe. Expelling ISIS\u2019s hybrid forces from terrain and setting conditions to prevent their return is a much more complicated task with which American and Western militaries are nevertheless familiar.\n--  Current U.S. policy appears to assume that depriving ISIS of its control of Mosul or ar Raqqa will lead to the organization\u2019s collapse. That assumption was likely valid in 2014 and early 2015, but it is no longer true.\n--  Jabhat al Nusra draws strength from its intertwinement with Syrian Sunni opposition groups. The slow pace of U.S. strategy and its exclusive prioritization of ISIS are facilitating Jabhat al Nusra\u2019s deeper entrenchment within the opposition. \n-- All operations against Jabhat al Nusra and ISIS must be integrated into a single coherent strategic concept that takes account of the divergence of interests between the U.S. and its European partners, on the one hand, and Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia on the other.\n--  The U.S. and its Western partners will have to conduct multiple simultaneous and successive operations whose exact course cannot be described fully in advance.\" I  respectfully dissent.

What matters more will be the number in Mosul when the main offensive begins, and since there will continue to exist a western opening to Mosul, this number may vary. If I had to guess, I'd say the jihadist forces in Mosul after they have been pinched back from the southern river valley, and assuming no reinforcements from Syria, etc., will be approximately 5,000. If a large majority of the southern forces head straight through to Raqqa, the number will be less. Urban warfare tactics It will be interesting to see the tactics that will be employed by those forces which seek to retake Mosul, especially since it will not be encircled. I'm thinking that complete encirclement would allow a more measured approach (the enemy is not going anywhere -- and pressure can come from mere contact). But without that, the attacker would seem to be destined to some series of continual assaults (with pressure coming from pace). With encirclement, one might be able to just \"hug\" the enemy and keep pressure on whatever the supply to the front lines were; thus keeping the frontlines in tatters; and playing defense against whatever local counter-attacks they might muster. I'm thinking that the French and American ground artillery units could be used in either a \"hug and let them attack us\" or a \"continuous assault\" variation; so no special indicator there, I don't think. \"We will go to Mosul, they will go to Tel Afar. We will go to Tel Afar, they will go to Baaj\"\nThat seems like a fairly gigantic assumption, and I wonder if there are contingency plans should ISIS choose not to play the role that Jabouri has assigned to them in his imaginary narrative. I again question the wisdom in allowing them to go anywhere. I'm also thinking that ISIS will surrender eastern Mosul fairly rapidly to the Kurds, but will be more resistant in western Mosul. ISIS would make this withdrawal not so much because the Kurds would be better fighters, but because ISIS would not want western Mosul to fall first, cutting off any fighters in eastern Mosul. a. I do believe a determined assault on Mosul will begin this Fall\nb. I do believe the city will be retaken before January 1. I am assuming, similar to Jabouri, that many local ISIS jihadists will run away; and that there will not be a major influx of local collaborators picking up arms and fighting alongside ISIS. I am also assuming that a \"continuous assault\" tactic will be used (at least up to the point that the city center is captured -- which is the marker I am forecasting upon). I am not forecasting higher at the moment because the exact status of the airbase remains unclear, and the Iraqi Army still has scores of kilometers to go to get within striking range of Mosul. A true military dilemma appears to be shaping up for ISIS. 1) They can consolidate in Raqqa and take on the Turkish army. Turkey would have less experienced fighters, more armor, and a rather large pool of replacements. 2) They can consolidate in Mosul and take on the Iraqi army. The Iraqi army is more experienced, but has less armor, and a smaller replacement pool. After eastern Mosul is evacuated, I don't think the peshmerga will have a very large role in the remaining Mosul battle. If ISIS decided to consolidate in Mosul early, my forecast would go down; but indications are, so far, that Raqqa is the base that the ISIS fighters are consolidating upon. *Update#1: \"the estimated 3,000 to 4,500 Islamic State group fighters estimated in Mosul\"\nhttp://www.stripes.com/news/us-sends-more-troops-to-iraq-to-prepare-for-mosul-battle-1.427978 As I mentioned previously, as the battle approaches, the propaganda estimates of ISIS jihadists must come closer to reality.

At present, it appears these approaches to Mosul are open, thus allowing inter-communication with ISIS elements in Syria and elsewhere (Mosul is not fully encircled); and that there are no plans, even after some direct assault upon Mosul might begin, to close these approaches. As stated previously, leaving an escape route is a common tactic in siege campaigns, but usually only after some period of full encirclement. In addition, the reports as to what is occurring in the region are strange. Some indicate it is spotted with Kurdish positions, while other reports indicate Tal Afar is a Shiite populated village, and yet it is a contested area with no semblance of coalition control. Even the particular report cited above is confusing. I can't interpret the word \"lab\" in the sense of a location that is conducting original car-bombing research (despite the fact that such dedicated research facilities are known to exist). Instead, I am interpreting this to mean some sort of construction or assembly facility. And, if this is true, why would ISIS place a \"booby-trap car [assembly facility]\" in such an out-of-the-way, isolated area? Why drive a bomb-laden car 50-100 km to get to the target? Maybe it was a bomb-maker training facility, and not so much a lab. In any case, I'm continuing with my \"any action in the Tal Afar vicinity is good action\" heuristic, but recognize it as a very sloppy tool. Late half-measures better than none?\n\"But some military planners are concerned that ISIS is simply shifting resources and troops from Mosul to better defend the city of Raqqa, Syria, the capital of the self-declared caliphate.

Goldfein lists these as:\n1) rule of law\n2) governance that provides basic services\n3) economic base that provides jobs. \"Rule of law\" is not a sufficient condition! Somehow we must un-learn this dangerous notion that has been, and is continually being, pounded into our heads. One need only look at ISIS. They have their own rule of law. Note the construction of the other two fundamental conditions outlined by Goldfein. They use an X yields Y construction. Yet \"rule of law\" (X) sits out there like a sore thumb. It's not an X. It's not even a Y. At best, it's a Z! We absolutely, positively, need to ditch this simplistic notion which is both incomplete and dangerous. The proper set of fundamental conditions are:\n1) moral governance that provides a legal framework for justice\n2) administration that provides basic services\n3) economic base that provides jobs Just because \"moral governance\" and \"justice\" are more complex and nuanced we must not shy away from embracing them directly.

Previously, immediately following the capture of the airbase, we heard an estimate of six weeks for the base to be refurbished to achieve the condition necessary to accommodate the materiel required for the \"big push\" (contingent on the surrounding areas being made secure). Now, while certainly estimates can change, with the surrounding area finally secured, we are told the initial estimates were wrong. There's just something curious about the timing here ... this new estimate comes out at the very same moment that the area is sufficiently cleared to begin wholesale refurbishment operations. It's not like nobody was on the base in the interim period, looking around, making (confirming) estimates, doing preliminary work. Why weren't the estimates updated as new observations were made?

The PRIZES on offer for the Offense: \"political land grab\" for \"the right to reclaim Mosul\" and, claim portions thereof, have begun EVEN BEFORE the actual battle w/in Mosul. http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/iraq-government-marginalize-kurds-mosul-battle.html;  Clearly, PM  al-Abadi's continued inability to control EITHER the political or military the structure &, involvement of the Kurdistan, Iraqi, Iranian & \"other Coalition Forces\" EACH now \"chomping at the bit to get a piece of the action\" within Mosul,  only adds to his tenuous position as Prime Minister of war torn Iraq, should this \"undisputed disequilibrium\" continue as these various interests each set themselves up to split Iraq up, again? On this particular question, I CONTINUE to apply a forward looking, hopefully out of the box/imaginative, unexpected consequence analysis. Backward looking analysis is of no benefit for resolution of this Q, at least from my perspective. 1. For example, what are the probabilities of Peshmerga, refusing to adhere to al Abadi's instructions on - limited entry -  into Mosul thereby forcing their own \"retaking\" of \"parts\" of the City?  2. al-Abdi's response ? Can he do anything about it? Considering his tenuous political position  3. As the facts on the ground will continue to change dramatically in the coming weeks and, months, what are the probabilities  of military disputes/battles AMONGST themselves?  All are  similarly situated parties w/ significantly different interests,  as they seek out the common goal of eliminating ISIL combatants in URBAN warfare tactics.   4. What are the probabilities of the Popular Mobilization Front, the Peshmerga, the official Iraq Forces, and, of course, other Shi'ite militia not a part of PMF either on the outskirts &, eventually within Mosul itself being able to coordinate a successful retaking of Mosul? Each are justifiable questions under the present facts/circumstances  - to an increasingly complex -  geopolitical issue.  On the one hand for example, the top PESHMERGA  Commander continues ignore al-Abadi's instruction to avoid direct Mosul involvement (Footnote1). Iraq forces will NOT (??!) be allowed to recapture any lost territories w/o OUR coordination he claimed. They clearly & consistently reject al-Abadi's instruction to stop their advancement in & beyond the Nineveh province ( Mosul corridor) (2).  On the other hand, it is increasingly clear QASSEM  SOLEIMANI, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ( IRGC) Commander &, leader of QUDS FORCE has taken over on the ground responsibility of Shi'ia militias inside Iraq. It is common knowledge both Peshmerga & the Qud Force are at odds with each other. NB: Fallujah. The Popular Mobilization Front ( PMF ) will nonetheless play a major role.(3)  5. Is there NOT an unseemly relevance ...to the so-called \"Coalition Forces\" that ...Soleimani & the IRGC who are/have been listed as ...INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS,  that are directly involved in on the ground operations to retake Mosul WITH U.S. DIRECT/INDIRECT involvement ? (4) It is therefore, under the above-mentioned facts & circumstances, an extremely high probability >90% the humanitarian crisis the world has without action watched in Aleppo, Fallujha & other Syrian & Iraqi locations WILL, do so ( watch) again this time w/ factor 2/3x the number of displaced refugees for Mosul through 2017. (5) On the other hand, NB: please note : US Commander Lt. General MacFarland, in his closing address argued, the crisis is not as severe as one contemplates (6) Conclusion: My fundamental hypothesis reference 3/8/16 update stands. To avoid a long story - I will not attach it here to. Simply refer back to the note.  I promised  myself to AVOID any updates until September so I have failed.  Therefore, I shall avoid any such update through SEPTEMBER unless compelling information requires me to UPGRADE my forecast.   Thank you for having the patience to bear w/ my style of analysis. Grammar, spelling. Thought process.  Point is: The innocent individuals in Mosul have an ugly process awaiting. It hasn't even begun for them.  ////////// (1)  http://rudaw.net/mobile/english/kurdistan/21082016 (2) http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2016/08/19/Kurds-reject-Iraqi-call-for-them-to-stop-Mosul-advance/1281471613109/ (3)http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/qassem-soleimani-to-play-major-role-in-mosul-operations.php ; http://m.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/iraqs-shiite-militias-say-they-will-be-part-of-mosul-battle-despite-war-crimes-claims (4) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani; http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Opinion/2016/08/17/US-must-correct-its-Iraq-strategy-in-the-battle-for-Mosul/8981471455423/; https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp644.aspx\n(5)http://rudaw.net/mobile/english/interview/20082016\nhttp://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/kurds-warn-of-possible-humanitarian-disaster-once-battle-for-mosul-starts-1.2762074 (6) http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iraq-situation-report-august-9-15-2016 ; http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/iraq%20SITREP%202016-08-15.pdf "], [14613, "2016-08-25T20:08:19Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2016-08-25T19:57:10Z", [0.46], ""], [368, "2016-08-25T17:59:29Z", [0.0], ""], [22833, "2016-08-25T16:00:20Z", [0.0], ""], [1218, "2016-08-25T15:39:26Z", [0.45], "http://post.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Blobby%20map%2025%20AUG%202016.pdf It looks like they are surrounded ...."], [12879, "2016-08-25T15:29:11Z", [0.0], ""], [27738, "2016-08-25T12:57:03Z", [0.4], ""], [1269, "2016-08-25T11:24:56Z", [0.65], ""], [28414, "2016-08-25T10:05:48Z", [0.73], "\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-08/24/c_135630779.htm Iraqi forces free government compound in IS-held town near Mosul + Turks are coming "], [14208, "2016-08-25T04:34:31Z", [0.0], "Will the French Foreign Legion \"retake\" Mosul? http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/701996/French-Foreign-Legion-fight-against-ISIS-Middle-East"], [38, "2016-08-24T23:05:27Z", [0.66], "http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/iraq-forces-launch-push-to-retake-town-south-of-mosul There is a major campaign underway for Qayyarah, 60km s of Mosul which \"started at dawn with the participation of Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) and army forces\". \"US-led coalition aircraft provided support, . . . \" Also,  \"Iraqi forces had been working with armed residents inside the town for this offensive, a rare occurrence.\"\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/540212/ISIS-Death-Squads-Mysterious-Gunned-Down-Mosul-Abu-Wathba-al-Suadi-SAS-SEALS-IS-DaeshISIS commanders are reportedly being brazenly gunned down in the streets in daylight attacks by secret hit teams. \"  . .  masked killers are said to be prowling the streets of Mosul, Iraq looking for their next target in the Daesh ranks. . . .  a jihadi top brass known as Abu Wathba al-Saudi . . .  was killed in the streets of Mosul.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/iraqs-shiite-militias-say-they-will-be-part-of-mosul-battle-despite-war-crimes-claims \"Iraq\u2019s Shiite militias have made clear they will not be left out of the battle for Mosul, even though this could exacerbate the sectarian conflict in Iraq and stiffen ISIL\u2019s defence of the largely Sunni city.

It is through the western approaches that Mosul has communication and commerce with Raqqa, etc. The article implies (that Townsend implies) that Tal Afar will remain outside of allied control even after the Mosul offensive. While one tactic in siege warfare is to allow an enemy some route of escape, is is usually advisable to open the route only after it had previously been closed, not to allow it to remain open the entire time. How Tal Afar will be handled may not be decisive over all, but it may determine such things as length of battle and how many ISIS fighters actually flee Mosul (to pop up somewhere else later).

The U.S. had gathered some 6,500 Marines and 1,500 Army soldiers that would take part in the assault with about 2,500 Navy personnel in support roles. U.S. troops were grouped in two Regimental Combat Teams: Regimental Combat Team 1 comprised 3rd Battalion/1st Marines, 3rd Battalion/5th Marines, Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 4 and 23 (Seabees) as well as the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion/7th Cavalry. Regimental Combat Team 7 comprised the 1st Battalion/8th Marines, 1st Battalion/3rd Marines, the U.S. Army's 2nd Battalion/2nd Infantry and 2nd Battalion/12th Cavalry. About 2,000 Iraqi troops assisted with the assault. All were supported by aircraft and U.S. Marine and U.S. Army artillery battalions.\nThe 850-strong 1st Battalion of the Black Watch was ordered to help U.S. and Iraqi forces with the encirclement of Fallujah. As part of Task Force Black, D Squadron of the British SAS prepared to take part in the operation, but due to British political nervousness about the possible scale of the slaughter stopped any direct UK involvement in the ground battle.\nInsurgent Forces:\nIn April, Fallujah was defended by about 500 \"hardcore\" and 1,000+ \"part time\" insurgents. By November, it was estimated that the numbers had doubled. Another estimate put the number of insurgents at 3,000; however, a number of insurgent leaders escaped before the attack.\nThe Iraqi insurgents and foreign mujahadeen present in the city prepared fortified defenses in advance of the anticipated attack. They dug tunnels, trenches, prepared spider holes, and built and hid a wide variety of IEDs. In some locations they filled the interiors of darkened homes with large numbers of propane bottles, large drums of gasoline, and ordnance, all wired to a remote trigger that could be set off by an insurgent when troops entered the building. They blocked streets with Jersey barriers and even emplaced them within homes to create strong points behind which they could attack unsuspecting troops entering the building.

I maintain that many of these assassinations are being conducted so as to eliminate witnesses and evidence of collaboration with so-called allied forces. If, for example, the expeditionary targeting force (ETF) which killed Sami Jassim Mohammed Al-Jabouri was actually on a mission to capture him, then that means the mission failed, as have all the other missions which similarly resulted in killings. I don't believe the U.S. would allow such continuous failure to occur; so capturing was never \"the\" mission. If you are actually trying to \"defeat ISIS,\" the intelligence available from the likes of Al-Jabouri would be extremely valuable. They are worth far more to the anti-ISIS effort alive than dead.

These were propaganda statements then, and as propaganda approaches reality, the propaganda must give way. 2) There has never been any focus on \"destruction\" of ISIS. That is, the actual killing of jihadist fighters has never been a priority. Because of this, there is a gigantic number of ISIS fighters who, when the bodies are finally counted, will be found to be \"missing.\" That such large numbers of fighters (10-15,000?) have been allowed to \"melt away\" into the population is just another sign of how poorly the entire \"anti-ISIS\" operation has been conducted. By offering up such numbers now, the U.S. is, in effect, 'fessing up, which means the reality of actual bodies is not too far away.

HYPOTHESIS:  On the one hand, militarily  ISIS  can only DELAY the eventual outcome of being ousted from Mosul UNLESS, Coalition forces continue to dispute amongst themselves & fail to agree on the critical issue of, WHO is entitled to enter the parameters of Mosul to \"officially retake\" the City. Watch this issue carefully. NB POINT:  B8  below. THE most \"hopeful alternative would/could/should be\" ( ALL wishy washy, possibilities that have no place in GJ Super Forecasting) is an all out unofficial  capitulation by ISIS which, manifests itself in  attempts by a majority of members (key & otherwise)  to EXIT through still available corridors, through October, when the battle in earnest begins.   Unfortunately, this alternative remains a v/ low probability event in terms of - the actual significant loss of worldwide credibility ISIS carries w/ it's followers - were it to leave Mosul free of a hard, long, deadly battle. The numbers of those that will actually remain is pure speculation but, the following point is instructive.http://en.abna24.com/cultural/archive/2016/08/01/769341/story.html Thus, the significantly higher probability is a combined overwhelming coalition use of brutal force, that will eventually be brought to bear upon Mosul w/ close to One Million inhabitants. The consequences of which have been evident in ALEPPO, FALLUJAH, & increasingly RAQQA. Each are extremely relevant to any credible Mosul analysis. Each retaking ( or attempt thereto) campaign has carried - unexpected consequences - that simply contribute to an over >85% probability that will \"sow the seeds\" of further instability. NB detailed comments below.  On the other hand, there is still a PROCEDURAL issue. Whether this GJ Q - which now has a FIVE month resolution \"widow\" time limit  for \"anti-Islamic\" forces to \"retake Mosul\" - takes place w/in the 1/1/17 deadline date.  Definitional issues will surely come into play. Completely Defeating IS in Mosul Needs \u201cAbout One Year\u201d - BasNews http://www.basnews.com/index.php/en/news/iraq/289622  The GJ procedural issue is, in the greater scheme of this event, not important.  More critical is the fundamental issue that needs to be addressed by all direct military participants &, those forecasters involved in analyzing this question, as noted more recently in a CIA DIRECTOR  Brennan's ASPEN SECURITY FORUM interview ( previously noted). That is,  the extent to which Coalition Forces can -- realistically save many thousands of lives with proper PRE-ATTACK stabilization planning -- on co-ordinating  POST  assault measures. This IS a significant distinction w/ consequential differences. Adequate pre attack stabilization measures not only assure many thousands of lives, it provides the BEST JUDGEMENT available on combating the vicious circle of innocent survivors being infected w/ ISIS related ideologies that  WILL indeed find their rebirth in the ashes of Aleppo, Fallujah, Raqqa & Mosul should such pre attack stabilization NOT be put in pace PRIOR to the commencement of the attack phase.  These measures now will take time. Years. Not months.  A small but complex example: NB B8 Peshmerga's participation within the City ( not only the outskirts) of Mosul raises a question of their fundamental intention to lay claim on \"parts\" or the whole of Mosul!!  KURDS still  insist they have a clear right to negotiate w/ Iraqi over Mosul a/f the fact of a retaking  for both geographical & military reasons. http://rudaw.net/mobile/english/kurdistan/250720161; on this front alone, Iraq & Kurdistan remain very far apart on the above-mentioned basics.http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/iraq-government-marginalize-kurds-mosul-battle.html Thus, a long term plan for retaking of Mosul MUST from a policy perspective  insure an agreement upon, stable security forces  which are to be agreed upon, what type of reconstruction effort will be agreed upon, who pays for it, who is entitled to what territories post ISIS ouster and,  what guarantees will be provided to the inhabitants to return &, lead a reasonable life &, the like.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRCUO7-lbUE&sns=e ( NB: Fast Forward MOSUL discussion @ 11:00-15min). A. Is The Above-Mentiond, A monumental task,  A useless exercise, or simply a Pipe Dream??! Aleppo & Fallujah make abundantly clear military forces can easily destroy large swaths of a City under the claim of ousting ISIS on the one hand yet, on the other hand:  1) leave intolerable humanitarian consequences ( NB: baking heat in ME summer deserts kill w/o census figures accounting for this fact &, it is getting worse. http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21703269-more-war-even-climate-change-making-region-uninhabitable-middle?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/FirstFTAmericas/product );\n2) have innocent victims be subjected to basic human rights violations https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/iraq-fallujah-abuses-inquiry-mired-secrecy; 3) each of the above-mentioned make clear IRAQ & SYRIAN Governments HAVE & WILL consistently fail to adequately address questions on \"measured governance\" after the fact;  yet  4) worst of all, impose such unnecessary & immeasurable pain and suffering on the innocent inhabitants that the VICIOUS CIRCLE, simply begins again, considering young boys and girls know nothing other than war to rise up again & attack the next government in power.  http://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/idUKKCN10B071 **NOTA BIENNE: ** On this test of \"retaking\", Aleppo, Fallujah & other key areas, Assad in Syria & al-Abadi in Iraq have indeed already failed this test, MISERABLY.  Mosul & Raqqa are the next in line. Therefore, for this singular reason, the following question is appropriate to addressing a \"retaking of Mosul\".    DOES Director Brennan's, in his description of pre attack preparation events in Mosul,  a set out a LITMUS TEST as follows  ( above-mentioned):\n (a) on what an \"all inclusive successful retaking\" actually  means?  That is, a stabilization plan that (1) planning wise sets clear & realistic goals before the fact,  (2) defines a warfare conduct plan that  during military conduct of operations makes clear which specific forces are where they should & should not be at a designated point in time &,  (3) establishes the agreed upon critical components necessary to save many thousands of lives  DURING & AFTER the fact, that are given AUTOMATIC & MANDATORY designation well in advance and, agreed upon  at the PRE STAGE planning phase. NB: third party humanitarian free passage ways assured by \"certain\" parties to the conflict ( not subject to GOVERNMENT intervention) have failed miserably in Aleppo where implementation is still being \"discussed\". B. Facts On The Ground, It Is More Complicated Than Meets The Eye 1. The circumstantial evidence weighs heavily towards such a stabilization plan set out by Director Brennan as ...an impossible task.   Iraq's present \"POST MOSUL\" retaking plan falls woefully short, yet again. http://triblive.com/mobile/10840941-96/isis-mosul-says ; https://rusi.org/publication/rusi-journal/day-after-what-expect-post-islamic-state-mosul 2. Additionally, balanced against this, it is al- Abadi's decision, as he is PM of Iraq. It is also v clear on the one hand, he is extremely thankful for U.S. support, however, on the other hand, as relates to strategic decisions w/in his domain, the U.S. perspective IS   ONLY one of many. In fact, his view is U.S. troops are NOT actually needed.  The tension btw the two Countries is clearly palpable at times. http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/07/22/476382/Iraq-Haidar-alAbadi--Nayef-alShammari-Daesh--Mosul .  On these facts alone, good judgement begs an important QUESTION:  **If the U.S. remains in GOOD FAITH prepared to assist in the various battles in Iraq yet, is UNABLE to effectively & significantly influence  implementation of pre attack stabilization programs whose primary aim is to save thousands of lives &, prevent future similar ideological uprisings, WHY then should the U.S. continue to incur the cost of American lives &, billions of dollars of military support cost?** 3. Moving beyond this critical point, there is the  PRACTICAL weather issue for August/September. Note that the AVERAGE TEMPERATURE mid day range TODAY is btw 90-100 degree Fahrenheit Highs & 70-80 degree lows during this period.  SERIOUS battle is unlikely to begin anytime before late September, early October. http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=80604. It has also been estimated the average \"carry weight\" of an \"assault soldier\"  in these desert terrain areas can range btw 50-70lbs over & above their own weight carrying both consumable ( food, water & the like along w/ non consumable safety and weather related  gear). https://protonex.com/blog/what-do-soldiers-carry-and-whats-its-weight/  Suffice it to say, it is  an terrible practical battle load to carry which, during the planning stages, will be given serious considerations by Senior Level Decision Makers.  Leaving essentially OCTOBER-DECEMBER as the battle period.  A key ninety (90) day procedural GJ time limit for this extremely complex process to find its way to RESOLUTION through a - RETAKING of Mosul - whatever this may eventually come to agreed upon. NB: DEFINITIONAL ISSUES quite likely to come into play. http://www.vox.com/2016/7/29/12324640/iraq-isis-mosul-battle; http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/07/liberation-mosul-deja-vu-160729132258528.html 4. IMPORTANTLY, what does Putin have to do w/ Mosul? His influence has been UNDER-ESTIMATED in Syria.

They have their eyes set upon Mosul as a potential claim as a Kurdish City. NBB8. Is there not an obvious disequilibrium of interests btw the three?

Additionally, al-Abadi is supportive of the claim Mosul cannot be retaken w/o Peshmerga forces!!  There IS a significant dis-equilibrium of geopolitical vested interests given above-referenced Iraqi, Kurdistan, Russian, Iranian, & U.S. direct & indirect involvement.\nhttp://www.nrttv.com/EN/Details.aspx?Jimare=9138;\nhttp://www.iraqinews.com/features/mosul-liberation-abadi-bats-for-cooperation-with-peshmerga/ ; http://www.basnews.com/index.php/en/news/kurdistan/290516 6.

The Mosul population Sunni dominance sets the stage for unexpected & severe consequences as Shiite led Iraqi forces take part in what could well be the \"hollowing out\" of the City as the battle takes hold. On the one hand, al-Abadi insists he has complete control of Shiite led troops who will not be permitted to enter City limits. On the other hand, military leaders of these forces, pretty much say, no way. We will fight and enter regardless of what al-Abdai has to say; setting up course the potential for battle btw specific forces amongst themselves. \nhttp://rudaw.net/mobile/english/middleeast/30072016; http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/11219328;  http://www.vox.com/2016/7/29/12324640/iraq-isis-mosul-battle; http://m.jpost.com/Middle-East/Arab-world-Mosul-dreams-462693#article=6017MEY5M0FBQTg1QkYxMTg4MzJFQzgyQzU1M0UyMzVCMDk= 8. Finally, there is further SIGNIFICANT dispute. On the one hand, Kurdish Peshmerga may attempt to lay claim to Mosul IF GIVEN the opportunity to enter, battle & reclaim the City as Kurdish. On the other hand, the IRANIAN backed/influenced Popular Mobilization ( Shiite force which Mosul Sunni related forces refuse to accept) to this day continue to lay claim that al-Abadi has given them the right to participate \"hands on\"  in the battle which has clear IRANIAN implications. http://iswresearch.blogspot.ch/2016/08/iraq-situation-report-july-26-august-2.html?m=.  CONCLUSION: \"Retaking Mosul\" by a \"non Islamic force\" will eventually become a an RELEVANT definitional  dispute, whether it occurs b/f 1/1/17 or thereafter.  More substantively, fundamentally Bagdad will remain chaotic.  SADR has made clear he is a force to be reckoned with, not to be under-estimated. The above-mentioned makes clear a ninety day deadline to retake Mosul is close to a SLAM DUNK for al-Abadi to ATTEMPT to bring to a close before year end. Political existence wise, time is of the essence for al-Abadi.  He has staked his political capital on his position for Mosul by dogmatically reiterating time and again, the City will be retaken b/f year end. The process is complex. It is a foregone conclusion al-Abadi will FORCE by year end his objective. Such a politically motivated objective carries extremely high probability\nfactors ( when considering ALL of the interests of the relevant parties to this battle) of unexpected consequences which will be borne primarily by, once again, innocent bystanders in the first instance &, political participants in the second instance.

Without knowing more details, it's difficult to interpret the signal. (If pushed for a guess I'd say it was the Kurds lashing out at Baghdad for indicating that the PMUs may be used in Mosul in lieu of the Peshmerga.) In any case, it may be a definite escalation in the internal political battles of Iraq that are not, directly at least, related to ISIS, but between nominally anti-ISIS allies. Potential question resolution difficulty I already anticipate that at some point in the not too distant future, Turkey is going to directly invade Syria. (I believe the coup was faked from the start.) It is also possible that the Kurds unilaterally invade and occupy the eastern half of Mosul, and, separated by the Tigris, the PMUs end up occupying the western half.

I don't think Obama or most Americans would want to see on their TVs the sort of destruction that has happen in Aleppo, being done by US air strikes on Mosul. \nTo the north of Mosul are Kurdish Peshmerga forces, to the South are the (Shia) Iraqi government and army, which is unpopular (or hated) by most Sunnis. So even if ISIS is driven out of Mosul the (Sunni) inhabitants are not necessarily going to welcome their \"liberation\". This would mean likely mean that a post ISIS Mosul would be a de facto (largly) Sunni city occupied by \"foreign\" (e.g. Shias, Kurds) forces. After 15 years experience I don't think that the old neo-cons idea that \"liberated\" Iraqis immediately embrace the ideals of western democracy and live in peace and harmony, has many supporters. \nSo my conclusion is that for the Kurds, the US (and allies) and the Iraqi government there are more reasons to avoid a blood bath in Mosul than there are reasons to try for a quick victory. \nWhy in spite of this I still think there is a chance of Mosul ceasing to be held by ISIS is that non-ISIS Sunnis from within or without Mosul could throw ISIS out.

I'd be silly to not adapt my thinking to a well-considered argument in a situation (such as this) where I have no special insight or access to privileged information. I'm not going anywhere near the forecast of @RiseToVoteSir, however, because I do continue to believe that: a) there is no real \"physical\" barrier to accomplishment of the mission (only 4421 jihadist fighters), which situation will continue; b) that what will be determinative is a matter of moral commitment to achieve the objective; and c) the local population, including the PMUs, may perceive it to be in their best interest to demonstrate this commitment irrespective of any coalition planning. Mosul is like a block of wood sitting on a table. It's just sitting there, waiting to be knocked over. There is a (psychological) battle bubbling below the surface: Who is in control of the anti-ISIS operations anyway? The coalition or the Iraqi government? The Iraqi government has staked out an objective (before the end of the year), and therefore their future credibility must be, in some way, correlated with the achievement of this objective. I am not as confident as, I perceive @RiseToVoteSir in being, that it is the coalition planning that will determine the outcome. I am of the opinion that the Iraqi's have their own agenda, and that since the taking of Mosul is \"as easy as knocking a block of wood off a table,\" it might be their motivation and commitment that will prevail. Having said this, I do expect a lull as the coalition rotates troops and commands, and some delay as these acclimatize themselves. I also consider the closure of the western approaches to Mosul to be a major factor in eventual mission success, and feel that without definite steps to accomplish this the overall mission would be in jeopardy, but not the specific timing of it perhaps. I'm thinking the coalition has intentionally left the western approaches to Mosul open for use as leverage against the Iraqi government. So, how the issue of \"western approaches\" is resolved, particularly the timing, will greatly effect my forecast. I'll be looking to really focus my forecast during the September period.

Less frequently we think in terms of creating new communication networks or adding resources to the system to INTERFERE with existing command-and-control structures. Assume you are CEO of a large organization. Assume you are following a very basic \"incentive-based\" control model. In such a situation your ability to control the organization will be generally determined by your ability to control the various incentives provided to drive particular wanted behaviors. With proper distribution of incentives, you can align organizational elements to move the entire organization in a single direction, working as a CO-ORDINATED team to further the agenda that you, as CEO, have determined. Now, assume that some set of outside agencies come in and begin to provide significant incentives to the same entities nominally under your control. These entities are now incentivized to pursue objectives independent, and often in conflict, with the objectives that the organization NEEDS to be accomplished so that the entire CO-ORDINATED system can move forward together. In short, you get various portions of the organization working at cross-purposes, and both the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization suffer (in terms of meeting the objectives that you, as CEO, have set). This is the situation that the Iraqi government faces. When the Western-coalition negotiates independently with the Kurds, they reduce the effectiveness of the Iraqi central government. When the UN comes in with aid that by-passes Baghdad, they destabilize the central government. These efforts, it is plain to see, have the effect of breaking Iraq apart. As CEO you'd like this construction resource A to complete road section X prior to date Y (so as to prepare for the transport of farm product G in growing season K, for example). Nope. Can't do that now. Construction resource A has been \"stolen\" by NGO M to build something else, and as a result, your entire co-ordinated project series fails.  So, whenever we hear of anything that is \"by-passing Baghdad,\" we should look at it in the light of just one one more thing that weakens the Iraqi central government and contributes to the de-unification (and hence increased sectarianism) of that country. That there is corruption in Baghdad is a separate issue. (The recrimination that Bremer et. al. fostered the creation of the still existing primary channels of corruption with pallet-upon-pallet of U.S. currency isn't relevant either to the specific current question of stability, although it would be to the question of accountability.) There are simple ways that such corruption could be minimized, especially in terms of things like UN dollars.

Both relate to the \"post-ISIS political future of Mosul,\" and the second may possibly accelerate the timeframe for the attack on Mosul. The narrative of the first movement is that Sunni's and Shias everywhere, including Iraq, are forever bitter enemies, and there can be no accommodation or peaceful co-existence. More generally, this narrative is applied to all sects, and is therefore used in support of the independent Kurdistan movement as well. This is the mainstream narrative, and seems to be embodied in the recent movements by various Sunnis who demand some independent Sunni \"mini-state\" within Iraq (with Mosul as it's capital) as the post-ISIS political solution. That this movement is marching ahead is evidenced by the recent parliamentary moves toward constitutional reform which seem to prepare the groundwork for such a semi-independent \"Sunnistan.\" This is the movement that is apparently backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and is apparently silently endorsed by the anti-ISIS Western coalition, as evidenced by both the covert support of the ISIS fighters as well as the management of the pace and scope of anti-ISIS efforts. The narrative of the second movement is that there are nationalistic Iraqis that seek to break free of this sectarian strife, and are seeking to maintain (obtain?) a unified Iraq. This is an alternative (non-mainstream) narrative that does not get a lot of play. But, here is a story that does support this second narrative: \"ISIS brutality has created cross-sectarian alliances that will be hard to reverse.\"\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/feature/iraqs-shia-militias-arent-bad-you-think-16291 Here's an interesting bit: \"Iraqi Hashd al-Shaabi [PMUs] to be granted official status\"\nhttp://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/07/28/477274/Iraq-Popular-Mobilization-Forces-official-status-Prime-Minister-Haider-alAbadi-liberation-Fallujah-Mosul\nhttp://5.160.12.80/en/news/2016/07/28/1142663/iraqi-hashd-al-shaabi-to-be-granted-official-status-pm So, at the same time parliamentary moves are being made to create a framework for a future Sunnistan, the PMUs are being formalized to, presumably, authorize whatever future actions they might undertake. It is possible these two movements will come together, so to speak, in Mosul. If the outcome is to be a Sunnistan with Mosul as its capital, the coalition pace will continue and the battle for Mosul may not start until the political framework for Sunnistan is formalized. If the movement that desires a unified Iraq prevails, Mosul would not be part of any future Sunnistan, and the pace might accelerate with the PMUs taking a more active (and immediate) role in the battle for Mosul.

The message, as I understood it, was that civilians in Mosul were to be instructed to resist control by the ISIS fighters. Or, at least I think I recall such an announcement (message). Since then, we have seen at least three incidents of civilian uprisings in Mosul, each of which was quashed by ISIS, with the concomitant deaths of brave civilians. If we re-arrange the sequence in which we learned the following two events, we now discover another fiasco. First, we learned that ISIS was relocating forces and material within Mosul to embed them in civilian areas. ( http://aranews.net/2016/07/isis-relocates-its-strongholds-in-mosul-to-avoid-airstrikes/ ) Second, we learn of the detail of the exact propaganda messages that have been inserted into Mosul ( http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/millions-of-leaflets-urge-mosul-and-sharqat-people-to-avoid-isis-headquarters/ ). If we make the assumption that the propaganda leaflets were dropped in conjunction with a general \"information warfare\" campaign targeted at Mosul (including the announced \"cyberwarfare\" aspect), we see that ISIS has done no more than respond to the propaganda leaflets themselves in a very predictable fashion. So, unless I am missing something, the timing of the info op was so poor that it inspired premature uprisings and encouraged relocation of ISIS facilities to locations that are likely to generate higher civilian deaths than they would have otherwise. Someone needs to be held accountable for this. The operation apparently achieved some results, but the results were ill-timed. \"This alliance of convenience ... the KRG government, Turkey and Hashd al-Watani\"\nhttp://nationalinterest.org/feature/iraqs-silver-bullet-the-isis-fight-17053?page=2"], [67, "2016-07-25T02:30:44Z", [0.7], ""], [14208, "2016-07-25T02:04:26Z", [0.0], "\"we are relay runners\"  President Obama on Face the Nation interview 24 July 2016."], [368, "2016-07-24T21:03:02Z", [0.05], ""], [13377, "2016-07-24T20:06:02Z", [0.2], ""], [12874, "2016-07-24T18:03:41Z", [0.44], ""], [691, "2016-07-24T12:30:44Z", [0.42], ""], [10898, "2016-07-24T08:35:23Z", [0.3], ""], [755, "2016-07-24T00:56:14Z", [0.3], "WSJ, July 23, 'Iraqi Factions Vie to Take Part in Mosul Offensive - Capturing Mosul is complicated because of tangled local politics, demographics and size': http://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqi-factions-vie-to-take-part-in-mosul-offensive-1469139683\nExpress (UK), July 23, 'Soldiers fighting IS say terrorists have new plan to send Jihadis to us': http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/692540/Soldiers-fighting-IS-terrorists-new-plan-send-bombers-UK-threat-attack\nClips from Express article:\n\"Based just seven miles from Mosul, General Bahram Arif Yassin leads a force of 3,200 Iraqi-Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers.

Nevertheless, with all the \"commotion\" I can't completely discount the outcome within the next 6 months. so, upping my estimate somewhat so I'm not completely off the median (...have to listen to the crowd, you know.). For comparison, I look at Raqqa...isn't that an IFP?....and look at that city... cutting off access roads, isolating blah-blah, making inroads, BUT not yet taking Raqqa back. Mosul is a lot bigger and a lot more complicated. Even if the re-taking of Mosul is one of the highest operational priorities, how does that benefit long-term strategy if the best Iraqi troops are thrown into a killing buzz-saw and end up decimated? If there wasn't some \"magic\" timeline on a piece of paper pointing to a completion date for re-taking Mosul, then it would be a different battle plan and it would complete in 2017. My guess is there are as many special forces and snipers as we can logistically put in place in the battle space. The question becomes whether driven by a paper deadline or more conservative battle plan for success and have a solid, viable, 1st-line Iraqi force remaining. I'm skeptical, so I may not sufficiently appreciate the 3-d battle space in play. GJO just added an IFP about the date of Mosul dam collapse. Who knows. Obviously there is the factor of inability to pour enough shoring grout into the weakening structure. But also, there is the possibility that ISIS weaponizes its collapse as a last-ditch scorched-earth tactic. If  GJO is asking the question, then I'm assuming background intelligence is raising some bigger red flags of late..though probably based on its its increasing architectural weakness.

Thus, \"assembled to protect Mosul\" speaks of both inside and outside Mosul. It is likely many on the outside will fall back to the city proper, but until the western avenues in and out of Mosul are sealed, there's also the possibility these (and others) will escape to Syria or Jordan or Saudi Arabia or wherever. We need to keep re-calling the size of this ISIS force that is such a boogey-man and that is holding the entire world as hostage. THERE ARE ONLY APPROXIMATELY 4,500 JIHADIST FIGHTERS IN MOSUL.

UPDATE: \nHumbly Reiterate my longstanding well BELOW average GJ forecast. Admittedly, feel out \"in the cold\" relative to consensus. Additionally, am extremely wary of the \"bad forecaster\"  dogmatic, unwillingness to change a forecast when the facts change syndrome.  This said, every bit of both circumstantial & direct evidence support the PAST hypothesis  that, in this particular case, the TIMING & POLITICS play a more critical role than, the actual military onslaught to retake Mosul. The ability to eventually knock ISIS out has always be a given. Post Fallujah, this fact comes increasingly into play.  The following is an attempt to BUILD THE CASE of why w/in next five (5) months there remains a low probability of a so-called \"retaking\" which, in and of itself, is subject to definitional disputes. Especially a city the size of Mosul.  Over the past three-four weeks, it is now indisputably clear Bagdad is in a state of chaos. PM al-Badhi's is under  extreme political pressure to \"retake Mosul\". Whether he survives politically is now an open question. For him,  \"time is of the essence\". Politicians \"do what they can\" to survive. Irrespective of the consequences to achieve a political objective. Anywhere. More so, in the ME.   The difference btw being correct on \"retaking\" Mosul before 1/1/17 continues to be a calculated bet,  on the continued political chaos in Bagdad which serves only to undermine PM Abadi's tenuous control over the government ....vs ....an unexpected, efficient & well organized effort by so called Coalition forces to achieve their objective before year end.  BOTH are viable probabilities that justify being weight accordingly. Let me explain. COMMEMT:  For perspective, for example ALEPPO, Syrian has YET to be retaken by Syrian forces. Media & western sources have pushed the agenda Aleppo would be retaken for many months now. As we have seen, in the Western political arena ( Brexit & the U.S.) media has a self serving narrative that, has nothing to do w/ eventual outcome.  A similar GJ Q w/ a SPECIFIC  time  line was posed to forecasters.  Q resolved as a NO simply because of the timeline. Clearly, Aleppo will fall.  From my perspective, the eventual fact has/had never been in dispute. The combination of \"urban warfare along w/ conflicting geopolitical interests\" has only delayed the outcome to the point of creating yet another HUMANITARIAN crisis in the region. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54441; http://www.euronews.com/newswires/3219496-un-emergency-stocks-too-thin-to-feed-syrias-aleppo-if-under-siege/  Considering these SMALLER scale battlefield, outcome & attendant consequences in Syria along w/ Fallujah & Ramadi in Iraq simply provides proper geopolitical perspective on the one hand, with an independent/reasonable judgement, when attempting to forecast the \"retaking\" of a significantly larger, more complex operation in Mosul, Iraq.  Syrian & Iraqi regimes exhibit similar \"key\" battlefield efforts: surround, destroy, hollow out &, think about the consequences thereafter with their military tactics. This assertion comes into play both in Fallujah & Ramadi, especially considering the consequential side effects on the so-called retaking.  Definitional \"retaking\" remains a political priority w/ intended/unintended consequences of forcing short term political gains, irrespective of the, long term serious  consequences for innocent citizens and, further more significant economic/political instability.  For example, up to 50'000 refugees from Fallujah have now been  left in the desert and, another 350'000 (!) supposedly liberated from Ramadi now have nothing to go back to as the City has been destroyed  by Iraqi & supporting forces. Hollowed out. Shallow political victory with little substantive change. http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=16730 ; http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/aleppo-and-ramadi-refugees-fall-wrong-side-wests-syrian-narrative-620925257 Therefore, what becomes critical to distinguish at this stage  in  the *retaking* of Mosul  is: \n1) TIMING  of resolution of GJ Q ( five months - b/f 1/1/17) on the one hand;\n2) w/ the virtual 100% CERTAINTY *NB*on the other hand of two elements:\na) the siege of Mosul will  - indeed ULTIMATELY  -  result in a \"retaking\"; &\nb) the consequences of outcome will set off a chain of far more savage HUMANITARIAN consequences  for those innocent individuals who risk losing their lives by fleeing during what will surely see urban warfare tactics used by ISIS. http://soufangroup.com/tsg-intelbrief-more-u-s-troops-in-iraq/  NB: There are presently approximately 700'000 inhabitants in Mosul, down from nearly 1.9mn. Human shields & the basics of urban warfare in Mosul, w/ a population of close to 3/4 of a million people ...has been set well in advance... of the Iraqi  Coalition strike  upon Mosul City.  \n\nComplex is a simple word for the situation. Much easier would be ISIS to pick up & leave but, this is also now impossible as Mosul is surrounded by Peshmerga forces on the north &, ISF forces on the south. A still available v low probability option <5%  MIGHT, COULD, SHOULD ( all wishy washy, hope words) be an unexpected FULL capitulation by ISIS of Mosul &, agreement w/ Coalition Forces. More complex, is when ISIS members, like a chameleon, in the streets of Mosul turn into innocent bystanders rather than mortal enemies to the Coalition forces.

Mosul has not been under the control of the Iraqi government since the Iraq War. It was governed, more or less, by a multitude of Sunni gangs and organizations, before it was governed by the Islamic State. If Mosul is \"retaken\" from the Islamic State, many fighters will just fade into the background from whence they came, to re-emerge under a different banner later on. (Others will go to Libya; many already have.) The citizens of Mosul do not want to be under the control of the Iraqi government. An invasion by the Iraqi Army would be a bad idea. The powers that be in the US seem to recognize this, but what are they going to do about it?  My guess is that the US will make some deals with some \"friendly\" (i.e. opportunist) Sunnis who will make promises and profess to be against the Islamic State, so that the US can declare Mosul \"retaken\" and \"stable\" and Iraq's national borders preserved before the end of Pres. Obama's term. If the Sunnis get a semi-autonomous region, it may remove some incentive for disenfranchised Sunni populations to turn to organizations like the Islamic State for protection in the future....Another possibility is that the region will simply become a de facto Islamic State. Saudi Arabia will be dumping lots of money in there, so Iraqi Sunnis won't be able to escape radicalization if they want to (which many of them do, as there is a large contingent of secular and liberal Sunnis in Iraq). I'm inclined to go a little higher than consensus on this question, because I think it is a priority for the Obama administration to \"stabilize\" the situation in Iraq and make it look like the Islamic State has been defeated by the end of his term. It's still not clear how they intend to do that, however. And plans can easily go awry. What role will military action play? And what military? Sunni tribal militias, backed by whom exactly?

First of all, everything I read about the successes of the Iraqi Army mentions the use of \"elite troops.\" By definition, elite troops are few in number, so taking a large city like Mosul will almost certainly depend on large numbers of troops that will probably have divergent levels of training and leadership. I think the reliance on elite troops indicates that the fighting for Mosul will take longer than the operations for smaller cities. Moreover, from what I understand, these elite troops are experts in urban fighting. I don't know how they do in the countryside, and in order to take Mosul house-to-house, the Iraqi Army has to actually get there. According to this article ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKCN0ZL1FS ) the Iraqi Army is in the area of Qayara (al-Qayyarah on Google maps) west of the Tigris, and and Makhmour (Makhmur - Google maps) east of the Tigris. So what I say below is based on that as the Iraqi starting point as of this now. Looking at the map, there are only three major roads from the areas mentioned to Mosul. There's Highway 1 in the west, and Highway 80 in the east. Along the river in the west, there's a secondary road that appears to be paved, but it merges with Highway 1 a few miles south of Mosul. Both of the roads west of the river have to go through some comparatively rough country on the last leg toward Mosul. The highway in the east has to cross the Great Zab River, which looks rather wide on the satellite image. There appears to be only one bridge (Highway 80) and once the bridge is blown the river will be an obstacle. The reason I don't think that Mosul will fall in the time frame given is that I don't have very much faith in the Iraqi Army's ability to sustain a push through the hilly country to the west. Such a push would require tactically proficient troops down to the squad level, and savvy NCOs and junior officers. From what I know, the Iraqis are not that good. In the east, I'm sure Iraqi engineers would be able to bridge the river; obviously no river is insurmountable, but how long will it take to effectively cross it? But then the same shortcomings regarding training, NCOs, etc. come into play there. And through it all, the Iraqis have to maintain a lengthening logistical train. In short, I think this will be a very complex and challenging operation, and I don't think the Iraqi Army is up to it over the next six months. They'll be able to do it eventually, but not complete it in 2016.

Excellent  Q w/ extreme consequences.  Date: 30. Juni 2016 um 09:18:42 MESZ Subject: Syria/Mosul COMMENT: MOSUL HYPOTHESIS:\nIn a multi polar world, w/ the political establishment in Bagdad fighting off legislative anarchy does  Haider al-Abadi have sufficient political equilibrium to successfully assist Coalition Command in organizing, managing & retaking Mosul before year end? In Fallujah, he forced a \"retake\" of Fallujah prior to Mosul -  a decision U.S. authorities had previously cautioned against. CIA DIRECTOR Brennan's comments ...on Assad in Syria are noteworthy... relative to Mosul. The two are not separate nor independent. There is organizational modus operandi, or more critically, the consequences of a lack thereof co-primates political agreement, between the engaged forces,  that will continue to influence both timing and success of \"retaking\" Mosul. In Syria for example,  Putin has clearly & successfully filled a void left by the lack of  \"substantial & direct\"  U.S.  military engagement on the ground. This fact has not only strengthened Assad's hand, it has allowed Iran through its Hizbollah support,  to provide direct support to Assad's regime, further resulting in an uncertain & in-transparent mix of conflicting Syrian, Iranian, Russian interests in this region. These facts present a dangerous geopolitical disequilibrium requiring far sighted risk management capabilities.  Whether Iraq's al-Abadi has this capability to assist &, coordinate, oversee within Iraq is a serious & justifiable Q. There is a v high probability he does not have the capability w/in the designated time frame of this GJ Q. Aleppo, ANOTHER one of these GJ Q issues, was   NOT \"retaken\" by resolution date 1/7/16. As had been noted many times.   Due in great part to the inability of Coalition forces to reach a co-ordinated agreeded upon \"POLITICAL solution\". The military solution has always been clear.   This is the CRUX of the problem.  Exemplary, in ALEPPO the \"UN cease fire arrangements\" served only as an opportunity that resulted in providing time for Assad to, in political fact, strengthen his hand.  Therefore, as in Fallujah, Iraq, Aleppo, Syria will indeed be \"retaken\" after being completely hollowed out. However, the consequences of this so-called \"retaking\" along w/ impact on forward looking planning for MOSUL are subject to discussion, disagreement & become critical to resolution to the POLITICAL dilemma.  Whether in Syria or Iraq, on the ground battles, political disagreements between the Coalition Partners on strategic approaches have led to complications. Unforeseeable consequences  ? Or, foreseeable consequences  but, nonetheless military actions taken in the face of serious consequences. Think refugee displacement in Fallujah along w/ the side affects of more complex religious hatred &, upheaval created by Forces policing the area thereafter. In Syria, Brennan now readily admits Assad is stronger. In Iraq, U.S. authorities argued against Fallujah. To focus instead  on Mosul. Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi remains under such political pressure, he MUST show progress, irrespective of the human consequences. He has that \"hollow victory\" of Fallujah now to give him either a \"NOOSE  to hang himself\" or, \" BREATHING room\" for a proper structured and, focused battle plan for Mosul.http://iswresearch.blogspot.ch/2016/06/iraq-situation-report-june-21-28-2016.html?m=1 The relevance of Director Brennan's comments therefore  - become clear - in the run up to the largest offensive Coalition Forces are about to take up  in Mosul.  A task that must be completed according to this GJ Q w/in SIX months. A City of nearly 1mn population. With the dangerously unstable Mosul DAM in play. The \"unexpected\" consequences from such a large, coordinated effort must be \"expected\" before hand. RISK control along w/ OPTIONALITY management take on greater roles for the remainder of the year.   And, MORE critically, the competing religious & economic interests of various forces engaged simultaneously.  There are \"dizzying differences\" between the so-called Coalition Forces.  The much maligned Popular Mobilization Units ( PMU). Iraq Military forces. Kurdistan Peshmerga forces. The National Mobilization forces. And, NB: General Qasem Soleimani ( head of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Quds Force) &, the extent to which it & the PMU have an interest in extending Iran's influence on Mosul.  http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/06/29/472832/syria-john-brennan-cia-bashar-alassad-stronger-takfiri-daesh \"...CIA Director John Brennan acknowledges that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is in a \u201cbetter and stronger\u201d position in the Syrian conflict, compared to last year.

Is that going to work? Petraeus: I think carpet bombing is an absolutely tremendous idea if the enemy accommodates you by laying himself out like a carpet in the middle of the desert, without any civilians or infrastructure around him. Sadly, the Islamic State has learned that that is a losing proposition and does not accommodate us in that way. In fact, the Islamic State is very much underground now in places like Mosul and Raqqa. They are getting hammered when they pop their heads up; they get hammered if they get in a convoy. This campaign is now going a bit quicker than a lot of people anticipated. I've been in fights, the fight to Bagdad [in March 2003], where you are fighting very fiercely and intensely and all of a sudden the enemy just collapses, and I think we'll see some of this from ISIS in Iraq in the months ahead. I just can't imagine a force that is able to stay in the fight given how they're been pounded every day for such an extended period. Don't get me wrong, Mosul is a city of 2 million people, I know it well, my headquarters was there after the fight to Bagdad when I was commander of the great 101st Airborne Division. Mosul is a big city. And it's a very complex city in terms of the ethnic and sectarian groups and tribes. But I think the odds are now that it will be cleared before the end of the president's administration and it could, perhaps, go more quickly than we think. Bergen: Mosul could be out of ISIS hands by January 20, 2017? Petraeus: I think it is possible. Bergen: That's a big deal. Petraeus: It is a very big deal. I've said, from the very beginning, even in the darkest days, that the Islamic State would be defeated in Iraq and that the long-term threat in Iraq had more to do with Iraqi politics -- in which the Iranian-supported Shia militias play a very prominent role. Bergen: ISIS is clearly losing now? Petraeus: No question ISIS is a loser in Iraq and, increasingly, Syria. I am quite certain we will also get al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. There's no way you can run a state, and an army -- which is what ISIS still is right now -- without touching something that is going to lead to your demise sooner or later. Beyond that, we should be prepared for the fact that the Islamic State army is going to be defeated in Iraq, but there will still be residual terrorist cells and insurgent groups that will continue to carry out attacks in places like Bagdad. Comments: I have a very high respect for Petraeus. ETA of Jan 20 2017 for Mosul recapture out of bounds for this IFP, but this is not an exact science.

For those who may have participated in prior discussions on this topic, I'd like to continue the \"formal\" versus \"informal\" distinction. The formal is that which is official, the sorts of communications and announcements that are made to the public. The informal are are those communications that are restricted to \"those in the know\" or some \"inner circle.\" The restrictions may span from simple omission of inclusion within the formal communication, to complete deception. I draw your attention to the following paragraph:\n\"Troop levels in Iraq remain highly imprecise, however, because there are dozens of additional forces there under temporary orders that do not count against the 4,087 limit.\" Here is where knowledge of the informal communication is necessary so as to piece together an accurate understanding of the real number of U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq. The article states that there are \"dozens\" of such forces operating under temporary orders. Anecdotally, I have received information that I deem trustworthy that indicates to me that this estimate may be far too low. In fact, the information was communicated to me in such a fashion as to indicate that specific rotational schedules and troop deployments are being planned around the number of days required to stay within the \"temporary\" threshold. I don't believe such logistical gymnastics would be required if the number involved were only dozens. My sense is it's more like many of hundreds, at least. So, while there may be only 3,600 U.S. troops on the ground in a \"formal\" sense on any given day, my estimate would be that there are closer to 5,000 U.S. troops already on the ground in Iraq in an \"informal\" sense on any particular day. I know it's a bit counter-intuitive to use the word \"informal\" as that set of information which captures the most complete collection; but I don't think we've come up with a preferable alternative yet. Edit/Update: After posting the above I received communication that my estimate of total (informal) U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq of \"closer to 5,000\" was way too low. The claim was that it was closer to 10,000. Since then I have tried to find more specific information on the total (informal) count. Here's the best specific count I can find, as of March 9th: 5031. https://twitter.com/nancyayoussef/status/711952411921928193 The difference is obviously well more than \"dozens.\" If anyone can get data on more current \"temporary\" figures I like to know them please. Edit#2/Update: OK, so there's some concern that troop numbers are not the kind of thing that should be publicly discussed so as to not provide valuable information to \"the enemy.\" I'd buy that in a situation where it was a properly declared war.

Comment:   Why analyzing the modus operandi  is Fallujah relevant to Mosul ?  It's an opportunity to determine the probabilities of success for Mosul. With still nearly 3/4 of a million residents, Fallujah is not Mosul. Additionally, the  ancillary side effects of an all out attack on Mosul carry more extreme & unintended consequences. Not to mention \"disputes on retaking\" the city and, what point in time.  As mentioned, operandi is one variable. Another, is the side effects of taking a strategic decision, as the Iraq Government did, to force Fallujah first,  before Mosul. This  allows  a window of opportunity to analyze those unintended consequences. Another variable. Recall, the U.S. Government made clear its strategic preference to focus on Mosul first in April which, PM al-Abadi eventually decided against, to pursue his short term political gain of selling \" victory in Fallujah\"  to the ruling government in Bagdad which is presently in a state of political chaos. He needs an \"apparent\" victory to maintain his status quo which is presently under duress.  What has... already been forecast previously... ( NB below) is now becoming increasingly clear. On the one hand, Fallujah has become a HUMANITARIAN crisis w/ numbers as high as 90'000  now encamped within  the city without sufficient food and water in 40-50 degree temperatures. And, another 40'000 beyond the city limits encamped in the desert without sufficient basic necessities.  ( NB: below ISW report). More critically, Iraqi forces are still NO WHERE near taking the northern part of Fallujah ( which will eventually occur), in spite of al-Abadi's recent declaration that the \"entire\" city had been retaken. It will require further troop deployment , necessary machinery, weaponry and sufficient time to clean out the remaining parts of Fallujah. Such an effort naturally takes focus away from the primary strategic goal, Mosul.  http://iswresearch.blogspot.ch/2016/06/fallujah-control-of-terrain-map-june-17.html?m=1  However, the tactics now being used to round up, and control this area include executing citizens it believes complicit with the IS, further instilling a hatred against the troops that are supposed to have freed these individuals from IS control.  The Fallujah mission has >65% probability of being destined towards long term failure, with a short publicity success. NB: ISW below.  Note also, retired Kurdish army major general Abdulkhaliq Shahir argues the Fallujah move was a short term gain perhaps but, a strategic long term mistake.

Add to this mix, the clear U.S. objective of avoiding another ME quagmire which has little political support &, the aggressive self interests of the Russians & Iranians to achieve their particular interests in both Countries &, one comes to an undeniable conclusion:\nThe world WILL watch Aleppo be hollowed out & eventually retaken.

Iraqi Shi'a militias, tribal fighters, and the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) continued recapturing territory around Fallujah and began probing attacks into the city of Fallujah. However, there are numerous reports that the Popular Mobilization engaged in sectarian violence in Garma sub-district, reportedly destroying a mosque with explosives, looting homes and buildings, and kidnapping and executing civilians. While the reports could not be confirmed, this conduct is not anomalous for many of the Iraqi Shi'a militias operating in the area. Continued sectarian violence will have serious consequences on the stability of the Fallujah area, providing a support base for Sunni extremist groups and increasing the stabilization force requirements to hold the area. The visit of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - Quds Force commander Qassim Suleimani to the area and the prominent role of Iran's proxy militias underscore the level of influence Iran has over the conduct of the operation; the Popular Mobilization appears content to let the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) with Coalition airstrikes recapture Fallujah city itself while Iraqi Shi'a militias establish themselves in the area and take the credit.

It is an opportunity for the central government to regain the trust of Sunni Arab Iraqis. The residents of Mosul will carefully analyse this battle. If the coalition of Iraqi forces is able to expel ISIL from Fallujah and facilitate the re-emergence of local leadership, without resorting to sectarian violence or over-extending the central government's reach, it may quell anxieties in Mosul.

Fallujah is a Sunni-dominated city, and the mostly Shiite government suspects that that restive city is home to ISIS fighters threatening security in the capital. . . .  \"The calendar presents additional challenges to the Mosul campaign. Iraq already is bracing for additional attacks as Muslims mark the holy month of Ramadan starting the first week of June. In the past, ISIS has often chosen to mark Ramadan by launching spectacular attacks across the world. Such forbidding expectations of ISIS will likely keep the Iraqi security preoccupied with securing currently held territory, rather than claiming new land. And from July until October, Iraq will likely be too hot to launch the kind of sustained campaign needed to reclaim Mosul, as temperatures will easily reach 120 F.  \"At best, U.S. officials believe Iraqi forces will move forward a few towns between now and October, one defense official explained.\n. . . \n\"The U.S. rhetoric about the campaign for Mosul is much like what happened in the run-up to the fight to take back the central city of Ramadi from ISIS. For months, the U.S. military said the fight for Ramadi was imminent, only to push the date back. When the campaign began last fall, it took five months to claim the city, which is only a fifth of the size of Mosul. Iraqi Special Forces led that campaign, while Iraqis only agreed to go in with the help of a heavy U.S. air campaign. \" . .  while some fear pushing Mosul further back slows much needed momentum against ISIS, U.S. officials believe it is better to wait.

They are not in my expertise area and as the case of Aleppo indicates, it is really difficult to pin down what 'retake' means. But hard to resist every time I log into the site. So here goes. Unless IS command completely collapses inside Mosul, retaking will involve a lot of collateral damage. We are talking of a city with million+ inhabitants. It will set of another migration wave of very serious proportions. Despite the rhetoric, think the chances of present US admin triggering that situation in its last months is fairly low/negligible. Also, the morale/discipline of the Iraqi military is not what it ought to be for taking up such a serious offensive. The required 'discipline' can't be manufactured in a few months. Of course, it will be entirely a different matter if the Kurds are provided the required arms/permission for retaking Mosul, but that is unlikely. So, basically the question is, what is the probability of IS command structure collapsing within Mosul? There maybe a lot of deserters in the recent days due to their operational reversals, but does that mean the fighting capacity will be nullified? Unfortunately, I don't think so. In my experience, all organisations (no matter how poorly organised and led) tend to retain at least 20-30% of their members regardless of however bad it gets, perhaps due to sheer human inertia.

This would be something that arises within Iraq, and would be in many respects in opposition to the U.S. dominated narrative. (cc: @dada) And, just for the fun of it, it might go down something like this: The Kurdish peshmerga are used to establish an initial fighting base within the outskirts of Mosul. Then, one at a time, from various and multiple directions, each of the \"40 PMU militias\" would be singularly fed through the Kurds with the objective of conquering just one and only one city block at a time. After each block was captured, that PMU would be withdrawn, the peshmerga would move up, and the next PMU would attack the next city block. The Iraqi army could provide flank and rear security to the peshmerga, and a blocking force at various exits from Mosul. A handful of elite units could be on standby within the peshmerga area to exploit any rapid ISIS collapse. This sounds a lot better to me than having the Iraqis lead the charge. It would place constant pressure on ISIS, and give each PMU a stake in the victory. A rolling tide of constantly replaced PMU's, attacking from multiple directions, would be difficult for ISIS to adapt to, and would diminish the need for static intelligence because ISIS would be continually moving backward, with the frontline (actually secondline) continually filled with the advancing peshmerga. Yeah, I know it's not a game, but I'm thinking \"one block per PMU\" has maybe a lot going for it that might not be obvious.

The military\u2019s logistics and support systems remain underdeveloped, he said, as they have been since the United States began its massive military rebuilding effort in 2003.\u201d\nb) another problem he argues is Iraq's Russian made Su-25 jets \"miss more often than they hit\". 2. 19/4/16: Gulf News report from WAPO's Jackson Diehl arguing no liberation of Mosul in 2016, wherein  the complex, fundamental, practical obstacles on the ground, required at the geopolitical levels ( conflicting political demands on the one hand, with varying degrees of economic assistance on both sides economically & militarily on the other hand) set a very high bar of probability of success. http://m.gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/iraq-failure-is-a-sad-legacy-to-leave-behind-1.1716746\n3. Additionally, HP recently reiterated (...a past thread I have mentioned about the numbers of motivated, healthy, paid for troops necessary to retake Mosul w/in the next 8 months) that Iraq government estimates the number of IS insurgents IN Mosul at around 10'000.

For example, a document (Item D) from January 2016 obtained from a pharmacist who fled from Mosul to the rebel-held area of Azaz in north Aleppo countryside shows that many doctors and pharmacists have been clearing out their clinics and shops by selling medicine and equipment to customers outside the Islamic State wilaya of Ninawa in order to raise money to flee Islamic State territory and minimize Islamic State confiscation of material upon fleeing.

But this is not the way intelligent humans solve problems. We recognize that when we can't go from A to Z directly, we need to go from A to G as an intermediate step first. Some intermediate steps work, some don't. Some intermediate steps get to you to Z faster than others, etc. My argument is that if the priority is to defeat ISIS, and not to provide a playground for the proxies of others, nothing will get the world to the desired state Z faster, and at less cost, than to move to the immediate destruction of ISIS fighters wherever they may be.

Let us assume that the quoted number of 10,000 Daesh defenders is correct. Doctrine (Army Infantry School - TRADOC Command) uses certain ratio's for planning operations. One is that the defender has a built in 3-1 advantage, and in an urban environment that is a 5-1 advantage. There's reason therefore to see need for up to 50,000, but lets say that the the Fist to Arm (support troops required to feed and arm each fighter) ratio is not 5 to 1 as is the case for an expeditionary force but only 3-1 because of the home field advantage - then total force required is a 200,000 strong task force. Thats' just for everyone's consideration and sorry Air Force types - you can pound ground but you can't hold ground,(Air Cav excepted) and American force multipliers only work if the forces on the ground know how to call for and use them. As Anneinaks comment mentions many of the smaller towns encountered were easily taken on the road to Mosul, but subsequently lost and this demonstrates the basic need to leave a force in place to defend ground freshly taken from counter attack. What the existing task force can accomplish is this - they are tying up 10,000 Deash fighters that otherwise could wreak havoc elsewhere and that force is consuming resources as well, which brings me to my point - ISIS could abandon the field of battle to free up assets for use elsewhere."], [83, "2016-04-16T23:53:26Z", [0.05], "Need for Sunnis to play main role in the Mosul campaign and US reluctance to provide an adequate ground force could leave the Mosul under IS control until the next administration.

On March 24th the government in Baghdad announced the beginning of operations to retake the city of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest, from Islamic State (IS). The first phase went well. An Iraqi force of about 5,000 quickly overran several villages. But within a few days progress stalled, when a counter-attack by no more than 200 IS fighters resulted in the loss of the village of al-Nasr and the high ground it sits on. Some 20 Iraqi soldiers were killed. An American marine also died from a rocket attack on a small American \u201cfire base\u201d. . .  \"Iraqi officials still talk positively about pushing IS out of Mosul before the end of the year. . . . But the setback at al-Nasr has been a reality check. Just to take and hold al-Nasr, the local operations command says it needs to bring in more tribal fighters and police. \"Military analysts reckon there is, in fact, little prospect of a concerted attempt to regain Mosul before 2017. Michael Pregent, a former Intelligence Officer who served as an adviser to Kurdish peshmerga fighters in 2005-06 and worked with Sons of Iraq during the 2007 surge (and is now at the Hudson Institute, a think-tank), says no force large enough to do the job has been built. One under-strength Iraqi division with some American military advisers will not cut it. Pentagon sources reckon that a force of at least 40,000 will be needed. \"The problems do indeed appear immense. Iraqi intelligence puts IS\u2019s fighting strength in Mosul at around 10,000, although the Americans think that the number is dwindling as IS comes under pressure elsewhere. Whatever the precise figure, IS has had the best part of two years to build multilayered defences. Mr Pregent says that although there are reasonably capable peshmerga forces to the east of Mosul that can help, these units have little interest in trying to take a city that will never be a part of Kurdistan and in which their presence would provoke ethnic tensions. \"The same concerns, only more so, apply to the Shia-dominated Hashd al-Shaabi, or Popular Mobilisation Units. Their leaders claim that it will be impossible to regain control of Mosul unless they are involved. However, when Iraqi security forces (ISF) drove IS out of Ramadi, the capital of largely Sunni Anbar province, earlier this year, the Baghdad government, under pressure from the Americans, ordered the Hashd, some of which are trained by Iran, to stay away. They did not want a repeat of the sectarian reprisals that marred the retaking of another Sunni city, Tikrit, last year. \"There are other risks in deploying the Hashd for the assault on Mosul. In a survey carried out in February by an Iraqi polling firm that included 120 respondents in Mosul, 74% said they did not want to be liberated by the mainly Shia Iraqi army on its own, while 100% said they did not want to be liberated by Shia militias or Kurds. That does not mean Mosul\u2019s inhabitants support IS\u2014according to a nationwide survey in January, 95% of Iraqi Sunnis oppose it\u2014but it does suggest that they are at least as fearful of their potential liberators as they are of their oppressors. One solution would be to bring more Sunnis into the Hashd, but it will be hard to rebalance a force that consists of some 120,000 Shias and only about 16,000 Sunnis.\n. . .\n\"Another factor in the battle for Mosul will be the size and role of American forces. Air strikes are a given, but the Pentagon has said that it wants to set up more fire bases of the kind that came under attack last month. Both Ashton Carter, the defence secretary, and General Joe Dunford, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, have put forward plans that are believed to include, among other things, the deployment of more special forces and Apache helicopter gunships. These could operate from a new airbase at Erbil, 20 minutes\u2019 flying time from Mosul, if allowed to do so by the Iraqi Kurdistan authorities. However, the White House has yet to agree. . . . there is little indication that he [Obama] is ready to sanction military support on the scale needed to regain Mosul. That may have to wait until the election of a new president\u2014another reason to suppose that Mosul will be in IS hands until next year. \" . . . a recent spate of spectacular suicide-attacks by IS in the south suggests that its strategy is now to destabilise Iraq\u2019s southern provinces, thus putting pressure on the Iraqi army and the Hashd to restrict their operations in the north and west. IS knows that the fall of Mosul will signal, in effect, its defeat in Iraq; so it is determined to delay that moment for as long as it can. It may one day lose its bloody grip on the city. But when, how and at what cost it will be liberated, remains to be seen.\n~~~~~~\nEDIT:  see @Censusguyz http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/209265"], [691, "2016-04-15T20:44:29Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2016-04-15T19:53:03Z", [0.95], ""], [23887, "2016-04-15T19:43:09Z", [0.08], ""], [5386, "2016-04-15T17:29:27Z", [0.7], ""], [19170, "2016-04-15T15:21:08Z", [0.15], ""], [10959, "2016-04-15T08:56:06Z", [0.15], "I am from Iraq, and I honestly  do not think there will be some kind of a large scale attack on Mosul any time soon\nAnd that because of the current situation of the politics in Iraq.

Iraqi forces re-launched an offensive on the town of Hit, 85 miles (140 kilometers) west of Baghdad, under cover of heavy coalition airstrikes early Thursday morning, Sabah al-Numan said. Over the past week the U.S.-led coalition launched 17 airstrikes in and around Hit, according to Pentagon statements. Hit lies along an IS supply line linking the group's extremist forces in Iraq to those in Syria. Iraqi commanders say retaking the town is key to building on their current momentum after retaking Ramadi earlier this year and linking up government forces to the west and the north of Baghdad in preparation for an eventual push on Mosul. The counterterrorism forces, who are leading the Hit operation, reached within three kilometers of the city center Thursday before being forced to stop, al-Numan said. \"The commanders are making a plan to evacuate these families,\" Al-Numan said, adding that leaflets were dropped over Hit indicating which roads can be used to flee safely. Iraqi forces encountered similar problems when trying to clear Ramadi, the provincial capital of Anbar, of IS fighters earlier this year. As government forces advanced across downtown Ramadi, the extremists pulled back and took civilian captives with them as shields. The tactic significantly slowed the advance of ground troops. While downtown Ramadi was declared under government control in December 2015, it wasn't until two months later that Iraqi and coalition forces said the rest of the city was \"fully liberated.\" After storming across Iraq in the summer of 2014, over-running Iraq's second largest city of Mosul, IS still controls large swaths of territory in the country's north and west. https://www.yahoo.com/news/trapped-civilians-stall-iraqi-forces-battling-anbar-090136711.html?nhp=1"], [241, "2016-04-01T10:17:32Z", [0.02], ""], [14572, "2016-04-01T06:11:49Z", [0.68], ""], [10192, "2016-04-01T06:03:08Z", [0.85], ""], [102, "2016-04-01T02:00:51Z", [0.57], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/04/01/gitrep-31mar16pm/"], [1333, "2016-04-01T01:19:26Z", [0.25], "On March 28, the State Department announced it was hiring MosCamp, Inc. to set up the company\u2019s Aqua Dams around the embassy compound and at a separate site at the Iraqi capital\u2019s international airport.

The media has begun to pick up on this, but so far, the accounts do not seem to do it justice. The coalition has trained (or retrained) six Iraqi brigades, typically called the \u201cMosul Counterattack Brigades\u201d or just the \u201cCounterattack Brigades.\u201d It was these formations that did most of the work at Ramadi and several are being shifted north to begin the Mosul operation. They are performing considerably better than other Iraqi brigades, a fact that is increasingly understood throughout the Iraqi government, boosting their prestige and the influence of the United States. Coalition air power is hitting Da\u2019esh much harder than in the past, not because any additional assets have been allocated, but because the American military leadership has been able to convince the Iraqis to forego copious on-call fire support and plastering the ground in front of Iraqi formations with air strikes before even the smallest Iraqi offensive. As a result, U.S. commanders have been able to direct far more strike sorties against deliberate targets such as Da\u2019esh\u2019s oil, money, bomb-making plants, transportation, and leadership targets. Moreover, the coalition has been able to employ Special Operations Forces (SOF) more aggressively and creatively than in the past, achieving some impressive synergies with the air and conventional ground campaigns.  The United States has also put some additional assets into the fight in Iraq, such as the tube artillery deployed to Makhmur and advanced multiple-rocket launcher systems that have been employed elsewhere in Iraq. As the press is already reporting, there are probably about 5,000 American troops in Iraq\u2014not the 3,800 the U.S. government typically claims\u2014and they are far more involved in combat operations than most recognize.

But just one hour later many of them fled, fearing ISIS would strike back. \"Early in the day, there were already signs of trouble. A sergeant named Hussein from the artillery battalion told The Daily Beast, \u201cThere has been some delays in what we expected, but it\u2019s mostly because of their heavy use of sniper fire and of IEDS. We have not been really advancing today, but that is not part of our plan as of yet, but in coming hours, we are planning to move forward.\u201d \"The first challenge was to capture the strategic little village of Nasr that would open the road for the Iraqi military to take the rest of the area. The ultimate short-term aim is to cross the Tigris River and take Qayarrah. This would open the road to the city of Mosul for future operations. \"But the combat around Nasr did not go well. ISIS \u201cleft the village, and came back after a few hours,\u201d said one tired Shia Arab fighter named Mohammed who is part of the Shia-led Hashid Shaabi militia forces. He was angry at the Iraqi army, and the lack of U.S. air support after returning from the fight. \u201cThere were no airstrikes, where are the airstrikes?\u201d he complained. \"The cloudy weather and the lack of U.S. forward air controllers apparently prevented U.S. aircraft from carrying out strikes on Friday, while on Thursday, when the operation began, airstrikes could be seen hitting ISIS positions. \u201cThe operation continues according to the plan. Only the weather conditions are not good,\u201d said an Iraqi colonel, who refused to talk on the record. \u201cIf God wills it, everything will go to plan. The ISIS fighters are just depending on IEDs, and booby-trapped houses, there is no real confrontation. We are just dealing with bombs and snipers.\u201cThere are no civilians, in the area,\u201d he added.  \"It was stunning to see how quickly the mood changed on the battlefield. \"Early in the day, Iraqi soldiers led by the commander of the Nineveh operations, Lieutenant General Najim al-Jibouri, seemed to be in high spirits, dancing traditional dances, and preparing to move out with Humvees into the village of Nasr. \n\u201cOur morale is very high, we are just waiting for the order from the commander. We have weapons. We are fighting terrorists. They have no morals, and no goals,\u201d Iraqi soldier Hussein Samij from Diwaniyah province told The Daily Beast. \u201cAs soon we get orders to really advance, we can get there in two days to Qayarrah,\u201d he added. \"When their artillery struck something that created a huge explosion inside Nasr, Jibouri and his men shouted with joy. They thought maybe they\u2019d hit an ISIS suicide bomber. General Jibouri looked with his binoculars over the trench to see the result of the artillery, and it seemed he already thought he achieved victory over ISIS militants in the village. \nYet one hour later, his men were not so joyful, when most soldiers ran in panic, fleeing in their Humvees, fearing ISIS mortar attacks. Just a few of his men, including the artillery officers, stood their ground. \"This seems to be exactly the biggest problem for the Iraqi army: the lack of morale. One week ago Iraqi soldiers abandoned their base, which forced the United States to send in more Marines in support, and one of them was killed. Again this time, Iraqi army soldiers almost completely deserted their positions, fearing an ISIS response to their artillery when,  in reality, not one mortar shell or bullet hit close to their positions. \"The lack of courage of Iraqi soldiers led to laughter among the Kurdish Peshmerga forces stationed nearby in a supporting role. Unlike the Iraqi soldiers, the Peshmergas did not move one inch, kept on smoking, and were surprised when they saw suddenly all the soldiers fled. \u201cDid you film that?\u201d one Peshmerga soldier asked me, with evident disgust. \u201cThis is not the first time the Iraqi army ran away,\u201d said Peshmerga soldier Ali Ahmed, making the case that the Kurds should get more backing. \u201cUnfortunately the world does not appreciate us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not received much in terms of salaries, weapons or support. \u201cIf this huge force you see here were Peshmerga forces, we would have taken the village easily,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are not afraid.\u201d \"In the beginning it was difficult to take the criticism by the Kurdish Peshmerga seriously due to ongoing the ongoing rivalry between the Kurds and the Iraqi military over disputed territories. And it\u2019s worth noting that the Peshmerga had difficulties defending their front lines in August 2014 when ISIS attacked them and quickly overran many positions, including the Yazidi town of Sinjar, leading to the genocide of the Yazidi minority.  \"Since then, however, Peshmergas have recovered with the help of U.S. airstrikes, Western coalition training, and German advanced anti-tank rockets and weapons. While the Peshmerga only have two brigades equipped with U.S. weapons, the Iraqi Army is fully equipped with weapons, armored vehicles, and artillery. Many of the Kurdish Peshmerga have only their self-armored trucks and their old Kalashnikovs. And, still, they advance more quickly than Iraqi government forces.  \"Commander Zeyran Sheikh Hossani, the deputy commander of the Peshmerga troops here, who closely coordinates with the Iraqi commanders on the front, was shocked. \u201cThe Iraqi army is not moving as strongly as it should be,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cTaking back Sinjar for us Peshmerga was very difficult near the Syrian borders, but we are not like the Iraqi army, and we took it in two days.\u201d \u201cWe fight for our own blood, but the Iraqi army cannot take one village in one day,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they don\u2019t change their military tactics, they will not reach Qayarra, they will not even reach the river,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main problem is they don\u2019t fight for their beliefs, if we had the same equipment and weapons, we would have already cleared the area in a few days.\u201d \u201cAs you can see they have much better weapons and vehicles than us, at the current pace, I wonder how long it will take for them to take Mosul, if they cannot take even one village in two days,\u201d he said. \"Later in the afternoon two ISIS mortars hit close to the Iraqi army positions that had been deserted earlier.  \"The lack of morale among Iraqi soldiers indicates that maybe more U.S. boots on the ground are needed, or more support for the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, in order to make the Mosul operation more feasible. Another option would be involving the Iraqi Special Operation forces that played a major role in clearing out Ramadi.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  A few days ago I wondered if the \"3 villages\" they were attacking were the same \"3 villages\" as on the first day; it seems that the answer is yes.

The attack has started with Iraqi forces moving west from their base in the the Makhmour area, about 40 miles south of Mosul, to recapture four towns from the Islamic State. The attack was supported by U.S. airstrikes and Kurdish peshmerga forces, and the military is reportedly discussing the next advance to retake Qayyara with Shia militias. Kurdish forces say they are bracing for Islamic State counterattacks. In Syria, Assad regime forces have launched their attack on the Islamic State-held city of Palmyra, which militants captured last May. Yesterday, it was reported that government troops had seized the high ground near the city, and state media claimed today that the assault force had entered the city.

Mideast Brief: Foreign Policy [fp@foreignpolicy.com] Dateline 3-24-16 Iraqi forces launch operation to retake Mosul http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35889937 Dateline 12-29-15 There are notable differences between Ramadi and Mosul, not least the populations \u2013 or lack of. Mosul was once a city of some two million and while that is believed to have halved since IS took control in June 2014, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain. Ramadi had a population of 500,000 before the war but all but a few thousand militants had fled when the Iraqi army rolled in last week. Like Tikrit, Ramadi was largely abandoned by civilians when the Iraq army and Shia militias re-captured it from IS (Daesh). That matters because it allowed the US and its allies to pound IS positions with air strikes without fears of massive civilian casualties. Mosul remains a heavily- populated city and relentless bombing is an unlikely option. The Iraqis will have to fight IS street by street, a dangerous and bloody prospect. The lack of civilians also allowed the Iraqis to utilise the Iranian-backed Shia militias known as the Haashd al-Shaabi despite Ramadi and wider Anbar being a Sunni Arab stronghold. As in Tikrit, it is likely that civilians will be returned to Ramadi only once the Shia militias \u2013 which have had a chequered history of sectarian violence \u2013 have withdrawn.

The population is a mix of ISIL supporters and those who are trapped and will be used as human shields.\n-Last week, Iraqi aircraft dropped hundreds of thousands of leaflets, advising people that help was finally coming . . .  and advised them to be ready for \u201cthe biggest battle\u201d.\n-This week, the US-led fighters attacked chemical sites near Mosul supposedly used to produce mustard gas. \n-the Pentagon announced it was using cyber interference to block telecommunications within Mosul as it prepares to assist Iraq in retaking Mosul at an undisclosed date, in the immediate future.\n-Iraqi news outlets have been reporting that ISIL is currently sieving through the local population, arresting hundreds who refuse to join them in the defence of the city.\n-Australian forces just north of Baghdad were training a battalion of Iraqi soldiers who were from Mosul and were being readied for the liberation.\n-the Iraqi army has been gathering in the Makhmour province, just south of Mosul, in anticipation of the fight.\n-Kurdish forces have Mosul surrounded and are holding the insurgents in place, and have reportedly in recent weeks had \u201cdozens\u201d of ISIL fighters surrender to them, fearing they will die in Mosul.\n-Several weeks ago, Kurdish-led forces overran and recaptured the ISIL-held city of Shaddadi, the main town along the supply route that had linked Mosul to ISIL\u2019s headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa.\n-Mosul is now isolated and everything appears in place for an invasion, though there is politics on who will lead the assault. While the Kurdish forces that operate out of their autonomous province in northern Iraq have done most of the fighting so far, the Iraqi government is anxious that its own soldiers will be first into Mosul. . . .

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Iranian-backed Shia militia are also demanding to join the fight, after they were denied a place in the battle for Ramadi.

In my view, this is unlikely to be a disinformation campaign to increase the chances of a Mosul liberation.

Those officials who are highly doubtful of a successful mission culminating this year seem to be hinting at the considerable length of time the battle is forecast to take; this in itself does not reveal information pointing to a vastly different timeline from that which has already been implied by those in power. There seems to be no value in this type of deception. What may have value, however, is pretending as though you're going to attack soon, threatening and threatening, and only invading when the enemy let's his guard down, thinking you're bluffing.

Dateline 3-2-16 The poet Wallace Stevens wrote that there are \u201c13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.\u201d  Well, there must be at least 13 ways to look at the incredibly complicated American war to destroy the Islamic State, aka ISIS, ISIL and Daesh.  The question is, are intelligence commanders at the US Military\u2019s Central Command aka CENTCOM distorting or suppressing some judgments about this important war to make analysts\u2019 reports say just what the Obama White House wants them to? The answer to that tough question is in the hands of the Defense Department\u2019s Inspector General, whose report is not expected until sometime this Spring. In the mean time, the official judgment the intel foot-soldiers dispute, continues to be the White House line: That America is doing just fine, the war has turned a corner, and the Islamic State is losing ground in Iraq and Syria. Of course, wherever opinions vary, political leaders have felt free to pick and choose among \u2018em, and come to their own conclusions.  And when it comes to military and national security intelligence, opinions will always vary.  So what makes this dispute so important?  And what judgments exactly, about the IS war\u2019s past or future, are in dispute? Our guest today, Shane Harris, National Security Correspondent for The Daily beast.com, has been not just following this story, but frequently leading the journalistic pack in breaking important details: Among them, a quantification of how deeply divided the CENTCOM analysts are about what\u2019s been happening to their work. You probably recall that in 2002, the White House of President George W Bush claimed its intelligence services were clear that Iraq\u2019s dictator Saddam Houssein possessed dangerous stock of Weapons of Mass Destruction\u2026chemical, biological and even nuclear warheads, and delivery systems to threaten its neighbors, if not the United States. Even at the time, I reported for Nightline, that many intelligence officers disputed this judgment, and that some of them complained that their arguments were being ignored, as what the President wanted to hear, to support his plan for regime change in Iraq, was being \u201cstove-piped\u201d around careful consideration and rushed to the top as conclusive fact. To prevent such politically-driven abuse, the office of the Director of National Intelligence is now tasked with regularly checking with analysts about how they feel the system is working.  And not long ago, Shane Harris reported that National Intelligence Director James Clapper\u2019s checkers had gotten an earful of complaints that, when it comes to the war against IS, the system is failing badly, because of political thumbs on the scale. Even more recently, Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, Clapper\u2019s investigators found that fully 40% of the analysts at CENTCOM \u201creported that their reporting had been skewed by their bosses.\u201d Here\u2019s another interesting question \u2013 did Gen. Clapper know this?  And did he know it in September when he testified to Rep. Nunes\u2019 committee that no politicization of intelligence had \u2013 or would ever have \u2013 happened on his watch? So much to think about.  And to help us think, we are fortunate to have Shane Harris with us today, author of the esteemed book on cyberwar @War: The Rise of the Military-Internet Complex, and one of the top reporters tracking this story and these questions. http://davemarash.com/2016/03/02/march-2-2016-shane-harris/"], [689, "2016-03-04T15:25:33Z", [0.55], "Comment deleted on May 10, 2016 11:06PM UTC"], [3181, "2016-03-04T15:21:54Z", [0.15], ""], [12654, "2016-03-04T14:56:20Z", [0.4], ""], [1646, "2016-03-04T14:11:54Z", [0.25], ""], [2965, "2016-03-04T13:07:17Z", [0.65], ""], [1269, "2016-03-04T12:39:28Z", [0.4], ""], [1646, "2016-03-04T11:46:13Z", [0.45], ""], [20, "2016-03-04T11:44:55Z", [0.3], ""], [20954, "2016-03-04T10:25:43Z", [0.1], ""], [13377, "2016-03-04T08:49:50Z", [0.1], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/"], [43, "2016-03-04T08:05:31Z", [0.25], "Thinking over comments here: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/157927"], [498, "2016-03-04T05:44:30Z", [0.8], "Iraqi troops killed in ISIS rocket attack near Makhmour\nhttp://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/030320161 This is not good news.

Political bickering may cause the postponing of the operations. However, constrained by weather conditions, Iraqi and coalition forces will have to capture the city before the coming winter if they are to retake Mosul in 2016, as Abadi suggested. Military sources say the battle for Mosul will have to take place in the spring or in summer, as IS generally uses bad weather and the cover of rainy nights to attack frontlines.\n[...]\nThe city has become emblematic in the war against IS, and its liberation would not only destroy IS\u2019 center of power but deal a huge moral blow to the organization\u2019s expansionary narrative by marking the end of the caliphate, as proclaimed by its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Retired US Col. Harry Schute, who is currently a senior security adviser to the Kurdistan Regional Government, told Al-Monitor that it is still hard to say when the Mosul attack will take place, noting that \u201cshaping operations is required before such an offensive.\u201d These preparatory steps, which appear to be starting, include a further attack on IS\u2019 direct and strategic interests and the organization\u2019s supply lines and strategic locations.\n[...]\nOther key cities and regions will have to be taken over before any attack on Mosul can be launched. Schute said that the rest of the Tigris area, namely Baiji and cities such as Gyara and Tal Afar, will have to be liberated before the Mosul offensive. The Fallujah takeover might also be necessary, he added, given the tribal uprising against IS percolating there.\n~~~ COMMENT: I see that the consensus on this is near 50%. Based on this article that seems to have a relatively good summary of things, I don't think that's justified. It looks like a lot of things have to fall correctly for this to happen. Not only is planning still happening, but military folks are acknowledging that politics might delay the start of the campaign.

The deployment has been well-publicized -- it was trumpeted by Ash Carter in front of Congress in December -- but officials have been quiet about when they would begin conducting raids. This latest status update likely won\u2019t come as welcome news for Gen. Joseph Votel, current head of the Special Forces Command, who fired off an internal memo to Carter in December complaining that Pentagon officials were talking too much about what his commandos are doing. (FP\u2019s Dan De Luce got the scoop on that story, and it\u2019s worth rereading in light of the latest leak.) Getting the nod. As long expected, Lt. Gen. Raymond \u201cTony\u201d Thomas has been nominated to be the country\u2019s top commando, and his nomination will head to the Senate for approval to lead the  Special Operations Command. If confirmed, he\u2019ll replace Votel, who has been tapped to replace Gen. Lloyd Austin at Central Command, overseeing the wars in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Thomas currently runs the Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, and has spent his career leading special operations troops, both in the Army\u2019s elite Ranger battalion and Delta Force. He also worked at the CIA in 2013 as the top military liaison to the spy agency, and served as the 1st Armored Division\u2019s assistant commander during a deployment near Mosul in 2007. Notably, Votel and Thomas will share a nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 9.

Because the dam was constructed on a foundation of soluble gypsum, the engineers recommended the implementation of a grout curtain within the foundation before the superstructure was built. Instead, to speed construction of the dam, engineers installed a grouting gallery that would allow continuous grouting of the dam's foundation in order to promote stability. \" To my knowledge, grouting galleries are more commonly found in concrete dams, and are unusual in earth dams like this one.   That fateful decision meant that any prolonged interruption in grouting would endanger the dam. It's never wise to disregard Murphy's Law. From the paper above, the logic of the original (Swiss) consultants (referred to as SC) is explained  \"In the consideration of possible failure due to internal erosion in the embankment or in the foundation; SC put aside such possibility on the grounds that the embankment had a very defensive design by the provision of a wide and very well compacted clay core and ample filters upstream and downstream of the core and provision of drainage zones.

Mosul Dam faces a serious and unprecedented risk of catastrophic failure with little warning. Recognizing the gravity of this challenge, the Iraqi government under Prime Minister Abadi\u2019s leadership is preparing to take actions to mitigate the potential threat of the dam\u2019s failure, particularly following the Da\u2019esh attack on the facility in August 2014.

We would also like to acknowledge the considerable efforts of the Italian government in supporting ongoing efforts to stabilize the dam.

Iraqi commanders and their U.S. advisers are also debating whether the primary invasion force for the Islamic State group\u2019s stronghold should come from the Iraqi-controlled south or from the Kurdish region in the north and east \u2014 or maybe both, the general said. \u201cThe Iraqis clearly are seeing, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood I would estimate between eight and 12 brigades that could be part of the Mosul counterattack,\u201d [Army Maj. Gen. Richard] Clarke [said]. . . . The U.S. has signaled a willingness to provide ground-level combat advisers for Iraqi brigades and also attack helicopters for close-air support in urban terrain. But a key question remains whether the Iraqi government will ultimately request that expanded U.S. support, which is fiercely opposed by some factions of the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. There are about 3,800 U.S. troops authorized for Iraq. \"Clarke said U.S. officials have daily meetings with Iraqi generals about planning for Mosul. \"Everything that we do will be through the \u2014 with the approval of the \u2014 government of Iraq. ...  I think that still remains to be seen, what exact capabilities will be needed. It really goes to what the Iraqis need and when,\" Clarke said. \"If they do this on their own, it will be a more longer lasting, you know, win for the future of Iraq,\" Clarke said. \"The key question for the Iraqis' battle plan will be determining the best approach for the primary invasion force, whether to come from Mosul's south or from the Kurdish region to the city\u2019s north and east, Clarke said. Both options carry risks. Coming from the south is difficult because Islamic State militants control about 100 miles of terrain along the Tigris River, which the Iraqi force would need as a primary supply line linking Mosul to Baghdad. Coming from the Kurdish region is fraught with political problems because the autonomous regional government may not want to stage brigade-size units from the mostly Shiite Arab Iraqi force. And the Kurdish peshmerga fighters themselves are reluctant to serve as a primary invasion force due to ethnic tensions with Mosul's Sunni Arab population. \u201cIt goes to the operational construct of how the Iraqis may do this,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cBecause they could go completely to the Kurdistan region and be right on the footsteps of Mosul. Or they could go up through Bayji, up what we call Highway One, almost due north. And what this gives them are multiple options. \u201cOr they could use a combination of both,\u201d Clarke said. \"Many top U.S. military officials have suggested the Kurds' mission will be limited to \u201cblocking\u201d the Islamic State militants from any retreat in the direction of the Kurdish region. \"American officials expect at least two peshmerga brigades to join in operations in Mosul. \"The U.S. and Iraqis appear to be pushing troops toward Mosul. The Iraqi army is amassing combat units and the U.S. has stood up a train-advise-and-assist team at a division-level Iraqi operations center in the village of Makhmour, about 60 miles southeast of Mosul. Known as the Nineveh Operations Center, the facility in Makhmour is along the edge of Kurdish-controlled territory near the ISIS-held Tigris River valley and will be a primary base for the U.S. to support the Mosul operations.\n. . . \nClarke\u2019s comments suggest that the U.S. military believes the Iraqi force, which collapsed in 2014 as Islamic State militants seized major cities, has grown to a size sufficient for a Mosul operation.\n. . . \n\"In January, a defense official said the fight in Mosul will need \u201croughly 10 brigades\u201d for a total force of between 20,000 and 30,000.  The total Iraqi force that has undergone American-led training recently is reaching that size. About 16,000 Iraqi Security Forces and about 4,000 Kurdish peshmerga fighters have been trained, Clarke said. \"The U.S. military is now shipping two brigade-size equipment sets to the Peshmerga, providing enough weapons, vehicles and support gear to outfit about 4,400 Kurdish troops. \u201cThat equipment is arriving now,\u201d Clarke said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Trained men, materiel and plans seem to be getting lined up.

Iraqi security forces, Pentagon officials said, have begun to approach Falluja from three directions, and are now in what officials called the \u201cisolation\u201d part of the campaign to retake the city. Iraqi forces are trying to encircle the city \u2014 \u201clike a boa constrictor\u201d \u2014 one official said, and will then move to squeeze out Islamic State fighters, much in the same way they did in Ramadi. \"But Falluja is not Ramadi \u2014 it is more densely populated.

Feb 8: \"Iraq deploying thousands of troops to retake Mosul\" --> http://news.yahoo.com/iraq-deploying-thousands-troops-retake-mosul-114704876.html The Iraqi army is deploying thousands of soldiers to a northern base in preparation for operations to retake the Islamic State group's hub of Mosul, officials said on Monday. IS seized Mosul in June 2014 and except for air strikes has held Iraq's second city largely unopposed for more than 18 months as the country's security forces battled the jihadists in other areas. \"Units from the Iraqi army have begun arriving to a military base near the Makhmur district to start launching initial military operations toward Mosul,\" a staff brigadier general told AFP on condition of anonymity. Makhmur lies around 70 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of Mosul. \"There are three brigades located in that base now,\" and their number will eventually reach 4,500 soldiers, said the officer, who is part of the security command tasked with retaking Nineveh province, of which Mosul is the capital. Iraqi forces recaptured Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, west of Baghdad, in December in a major blow to the jihadists. But Mosul is expected to be the most difficult battle of Iraq's war against IS due to its size, the presence of large numbers of civilians in the city, and the long period the jihadists have had to prepare defences. It is the largest city held by IS, and along with Raqa in Syria is one of the two main hubs for the jihadists' operations. The initial aim is to sever IS supply lines between Mosul and areas farther south including Hawijah in Kirkuk province and areas near Baiji in Salaheddin, the army officer said. Iraqi forces have worked slowly and deliberately to isolate other IS-held cities such as Tikrit and Ramadi before launching assaults to retake them, and cutting off Mosul will likely take longer than either. Lieutenant General Sean MacFarland, the commander of the US-led operation against IS, has said that Iraqi generals do not think they will be able to recapture Mosul until the end of 2016 or early 2017 at the earliest. ~~~ COMMENT: Obviously, the money quote comes from the Lt Gen. \"End of 2016\" is pretty vague, but coupled with early 2017 leads me to believe the window that he's talking about would be maybe November through February? It's possible that this timeline is sped up, but I've rarely seen someone offer a window this far out (and call it the earliest) and then move up that window to an even earlier date. The only way that happens is if some faction of the global community makes it a priority to retake Mosul, which could happen. For now, I'm starting really low on this and watching for daily updates.

Mosul consists of a much larger population than any other town or city the ISF has captured previously. And they've depended on their smaller, more elite units like the Golden Brigade to lead the attacks in cities like Ramadi. Ramadi was assessed to have been largely abandoned by ISIS forces, which depending on the reports left either several hundred to 1000 troops in place. Also, the current population of Mosul is still enormous: 700,000 civilians. Which means the coalition air targeting-process is going to be slower and more reluctant to risk civilian casualties. Additionally, ISF has a willingness to slow operations to reduce civilian casualties (Ramadi).

In a volatile situation such as this - a lot. Thus, for me, time is the most important element in the equation and all the \"unknown unknowns\"  it holds. If you consider the question as linear, there are two separate aspects to the issue - assembling the force to do the deed followed by the actual thing - the assault on Mosul. Each piece consumes a great deal of time by their nature. Based on reports and the good observations by many members here getting to \"yes\" would be a near run thing with the time allowed (although I feel many are discounting the \"getting it together\" phase too lightly). But it's not a linear situation given the volatility and wide array of inputs that could effect the outcome. So, to me, you have to accept the realities of the time necessary to accomplish the linear process and then add another sum for the nonlinear nature of the question. These nonlinear unknown unknowns have a value that exceeds those of the linear idea. If it were a simple matter of assembling a force and then marching it up to battle successfully,  I would give that a  low probability of success given the time this process has consumed historically and in applicable reference scenarios. But I reserve a chunk of probability also for the nonlinear nature of the situation. Putting the two together, I'm comfortable at my current estimate where I assume the probability of an unknown slowing event greater than an unknown speeding up event given the nature of the complexity of getting to Yes. What I'm currently struggling with is how to account for the decay of time which has a value, but a value that shouldn't be linear (say, a flat -2 points a month). So the plan for the moment is to hold on time decay, monitor developments, and build a model for the decay of time (and thus the possibility of unknown unknowns) that depletes exponentially as the date for closure nears. Eventually, long before the actual deed is done, there simply won't be enough time to get to Yes even if everything goes as planned - if everyone is still talking but not doing by May/June? At that point, all that is left is for some unknowable event to speed the process somehow and I will have to reflect that possibility as a probability.

How fast is ISIS weakening? How weak will they become before their troops can be routed, or flee without further struggle? I do have a feeling that when ISIS eventually loses, it will happen rather suddenly, as a sense of hopelessness enters the ranks. I don't trust this feeling much, but it did lead me to ask myself the question: Does the average ISIS fighter care more about \"being on the winning side\", or \"being on the side with the righteous cause, no matter what?\" ISIS propaganda I've seen tends to emphasize the former, and the illusion of an ISIS victory (or at least steady progress) can't last forever.

Trying to read between the lines, I think the dam is in poor condition. From Stratfor website (subscription) - The U.S. Military has a contingency plan to address a potential collapse of Mosul dam in northern Iraq, Reuters reported Jan. 28. Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, head of the U.S.-led coalition bombing the Islamic State, said Iraqi authorities understood the possibility of the collapse of the hydroelectric dam, whose foundation requires continual grouting to maintain structural integrity. He told Baghdad reporters that authorities are trying to determine the likelihood of the dam collapsing, adding that the collapse will have disastrous effects. Islamic State militants seized the dam for two weeks in 2014, generating fears they might blow it up and release a wall of water on Mosul and Baghdad that could lead to thousands of civilian casualties. I also don't see the dam as the only thing to consider. Looking at the larger picture - In order to retake Mosul, we need to look at the desire and resources to defend/retake the city. IS is dealing with AQ for control of the revolutionary aspects that both entities strive to achieve (excellent document from Charles Lister of Brookings -  http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2016/01/27-islamic-state-challenges-alqaida-lister). IS has the ability and resources to engage in a wide geographic area. Is it worthwhile to defend a city that may not exist in its current form in the near future? Given how few combatants it took for them to defend Ramadi, it would not take a huge force to defend a city that it controls and has had ample time to supply.  On the Iraqi/U.S. side of the equation, while the government has little to no money (especially with low oil prices). The rebuilding of the Anbar area will test not only cooperation of sectarian elements, but drain quite a bit of monetary resources.

Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said of the CTS troops.\nBut, the senator added, they risk being worn out by overuse.\nThe elite forces recently led the way in taking back Ramadi from militants affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS and earlier spearheaded the offensive to recapture Tikrit when conventional Iraqi troops and Shia militias backed by Iran failed. They held on at the Baiji oil refinery when others fled and recently routed ISIS in fighting near Haditha in western Anbar province, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials.\n\"They are beginning to prepare for other efforts to retake territory\" from ISIS, said Reed, who recently returned from Iraq and meetings with U.S. and Iraqi commanders.\n\"One of the major objectives is Mosul,\" he said, but \"that's probably months and months away\" in the campaign against ISIS.\nJoint Chiefs Chairman Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford said the U.S. was looking at ways to speed up the timeline for commencing operations in Mosul. In Paris on Sunday, Dunford told reporters traveling with him that he will soon make recommendations to President Barack Obama on the possible repositioning of U.S. troops in northern Iraq to aid an assault on Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.\n\"We're about winning\" and \"we want to have the Iraqis win,\" he said.\nThe repositioning would involve placing U.S. advisors closer to Mosul than the Joint Operations Center in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish autonomous region, according to a Defense Department news release.\n\"It is fair to say we will have positions -- we already do (in Irbil) -- up in the north that will facilitate supporting Iraqi security forces as they isolate Mosul,\" Dunford said after meetings with Gen. Pierre de Villiers, chief of France's defense staff.\nFor the Iraqi Security Forces, the push north from Baiji up the Tigris River valley to Mosul will require more Iraqi troops and more U.S. soldiers to train them for a major operation, Army Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a briefing to the Pentagon from Baghdad last week.\n\"Hundreds, not thousands\" of additional U.S. troops will have to be deployed for the training assignment, he said. \"The reason we need new trainers or additional trainers is because that's really the next step in generating the amount of combat power needed to liberate Mosul.\"\nWarren added, \"We know we will need more (Iraqi) brigades to be trained, we'll need more troops trained in more specialties\" to liberate Mosul, the largest city controlled by ISIS.\nIt was impossible to know how many ISIS fighters were defending Mosul, but Warren said the estimates run from 5,000 to 10,000. To take back the city, the second largest in Iraq, \"We think we're going to need, you know, in the neighborhood of eight trained brigades\" of about 3,000 troops each, he said, \"but that's adjustable.\"\nIn Ramadi, three brigades of Iraqi Security Forces were used but only after the Counter-Terrorism Service troops cleared the way into the city. The troops threw up a pontoon bridge across the Euphrates River after ISIS militants blew the existing bridges. The elite forces then attacked to the city center, using bulldozers to throw up earth berms on either side of the advance to block ISIS suicide truck bombers on their flanks, Warren said.\nThe Ramadi assault followed a pattern of Iraqi attack -- CTS troops lead the way, conventional ISF forces conduct clearing operations, and Iraqi National Police, and on occasion Sunni tribal fighter, provide continuing security for rebuilding efforts.\nWhen Ramadi was retaken, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that Mosul also would be retaken in 2016. \"We are coming to liberate Mosul, which will be the fatal blow to\" ISIS, he said.\nIn the north, Fuad Hussein, chief of staff of the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, said his troops were ready for the push on Mosul but were awaiting the arrival of the Counter-Terrorism Service and Iraqi Security Forces.\n\"We had [a] discussion to liberate Mosul last year in March, and now we're in January 2016. So it has been delayed,\" Hussein told the Kurdish Rudaw news service last week. \"The question is why? To be honest it has to do with the Iraqis -- we need a partner.\"\nHussein praised the professionalism of the elite CTS troops. \"That unit has good fighters and are well organized and has a lot of experience,\" he said, \"So we need them to be with us as partners so that we can jointly, with the American help, liberate Mosul.\"\nSince the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the CTS, which was created by the U.S., has received the most training and the best equipment from the U.S., which recognized their unique role in the Iraqi national security structure as a relatively independent and non-sectarian fighting force.\nTo avoid political influence that plagues other units, the Counter-Terrorism Service reports directly to the prime minister, rather than going through the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior.\nIn a paper on the elite troops for the Brookings Institution, retired Army Special Operations Col. David Witty, said, \"Organizations such as CTS are at the heart of U.S. strategies in the Middle East that aim to develop indigenous capacity to combat insurgents and terrorists.\"\nAfter ISIS invaded Iraq and took Mosul in 2014, \"five of Iraq's 14 Army divisions were rated as ineffective, or had disappeared completely. U.S. advisers rated remaining units as infiltrated with Shia militias and Sunni extremists. At the other extreme, the Counter-Terrorism Service was assessed as the one bright spot of ISF. It was the best military organ,\" Witty said.\nThe elite unit \"was able to maintain its cohesion and effectiveness, despite experiencing some of the most intensive combat, suffering heavy losses, and continuing to be used as a regular, although elite, ISF unit, rather than in a dedicated counter-terrorism role,\" Witty said.\nIn a round table session with reporters earlier this month, Sen. Reed said of the service, \"We need to have capable forces fighting alongside them, and that's the goal, and we are trying to train up those forces now.\""], [61, "2016-01-28T01:32:36Z", [0.2], ""], [755, "2016-01-28T00:15:10Z", [0.25], "A great opinion piece stating the Iraqi Army is far from ready to conduct a major combat operation against Mosul:\nThe National Interest, January 25, 'The Long Road to Fallujah and Mosul': http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-long-road-fallujah-mosul-15018\nRemember, the invasion of Europe in 1944 was years in it's planning and execution.

Hundreds of combatants and civilians have been killed over the past week, and Russian aircraft have been dropping supplies to beleaguered army units. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad is battling to retain a foothold in the area. It still controls the military airport to the south, but ISIS claims to have overrun several regime-held districts at the beginning of the week, taking advantage of a sandstorm that grounded military aircraft. But in the last few days, Russian and possibly Syrian warplanes have carried out airstrikes against ISIS areas, while the already desperate situation of civilians has worsened. The Institute for the Study of War -- a Washington-based group that analyzes the conflict in Iraq and Syria -- said Russia had shifted the focus of its air campaign to Deir Ezzor in the face of the major ISIS assault on parts of the city still held by the regime. \"The shift in Russian air operations serves to forestall the immediate defeat of regime forces in Deir Ezzor, one of the last remaining regime outposts in Eastern Syria,\" the Institute said. http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/22/world/syria-isis-deir-ezzor/index.html History of Kurds in Mosul: https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/169/36383.html"], [10039, "2016-01-23T12:56:53Z", [0.6], ""], [16592, "2016-01-23T12:36:12Z", [0.8], ""], [14394, "2016-01-23T09:10:18Z", [0.16], "Slightly upping the chance mosul falls this year as plans seem underway to make an attempt:\nhttp://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/23012016\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-23/iraq-australian-trained-commandos-prepare-for-mosul-offensive/7109600 +5% If the offensive starts in June that leaves very little time to reach the city, surround it and take it.

ISIS is likely to be a formidable foe against an Iraqi Army that has proven itself highly ineffective.  There are few other players that seem keen on getting involved that may hasten an ISIS defeat in Mosul.  Turkey has not demonstrated any interest in defeating ISIS since its primary concern is the Kurds.  And, the Kurds are preoccupied with defending its interests against Turkey, so they would likely only get involved reluctantly.  Additionally, neither the American people nor the Obama administration has the willingness to invest the ground forces required to defeat and destroy ISIS.  Finally, the wealthy Gulf/Arab countries have done little to date to help defeat ISIS.

Mosul has been under IS control for longer and IS forces are quite well entrenched in the city. The battle for Tikrit (a city a tenth the size of Mosul) took months in planning and several weeks for anti-IS forces to secure. A failed attempt to retake Mosul could have disastrous effects on the already low morale of the Iraqi army which means they are unlikely to attempt it without a high degree of confidence. In order to attempt it the army would likely need to be able to encircle Mosul to cut off supply lines and be able to dedicate a substantial number of troops implying that the situation elsewhere had stabilized to the extent that it is feasible to divert troops. \nTroops required: The battle of Tikrit involved around 30,000 anti- IS soldiers (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/world/middleeast/iraq-tikrit-isis.html?_r=0). Given that the IS presence in Mosul is more established (though arguably weakened by a lack of funds/troop payment), the city is over 10 times as large as Tikrit, it is located deeper in IS territory  making it easier for them to get reinforcements and the central government has been unpopular in the past, Mosul is expected to be a harder fight. As such I am estimating the coalition will not attempt it with less than 60,000 troops. Where to get 60,000 troops?  Information on the training of troops has been hard to find (including the ratio of international/Iraqi trainers to troops required) \u2013 due to lack of information we are using U.S. numbers as a base. In 2015, the US claimed to have trained approximately 12,000 troops and volunteers in 9 months with 450 trainers (3 soldiers to 1 trainer per month) (http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/08/training-iraqi-military-barely-defend-150805114501323.html).  At the rate the US trained forces in 2015, to train up to the 60,000 troop level we have set as the base level, it would take the 450 trainers 36 months to train sufficient forces (assuming that already trained troops were included in the overall number). There is also a high-level of absenteeism in Iraqi forces (between 10-20%) so accounting for that, the total number of trained troops would need to be 66,000 (at the lowest end) adding a further 4.5 months. This number does not take into account the fact that there are British/Australian/New Zealand trainers also supporting troop training in Iraq (though at lower numbers) or that the Americans could send reinforcements so we have adjusted this to  24 months (at mininun) to prepare a force for an attack on Mosul. While these numbers are a very broad estimate, the fact that the forces are unlikely to be ready in 2016 is a view announced by the Iraqi Kurdish deputy PM (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-idUSKCN0UU0AO).  Even if you could mobilze and train sufficient forces for an attack on Mosul in 2016 the assault of the city is itself is likely to take several weeks and the preparation to secure the land around it many more months before. The need for coordinated planning from the international coalition for air support and Kurdish forces is also likely to take several months \u2013 hard to say how long each segment of this would take but I think 8 months would be ambitious, meaning that troops would need to be trained before April. Why Mosul?\nThe city of Mosul itself, while important as it is the HQ for IS in Iraq, is arguably not as important as keeping control of the Mosul Dam. In addition, countering IS\u2019s spread into the Anbar province will likely be a higher priority together with containing the southern advance than retaking the city itself. \nGiven this, the likelihood of the government attempting to take Mosul is relatively low \u2013 I\u2019m thinking approximately 20% chance that they try.  Will they succeed? \nThe second element after whether or not they try is if they will succeed. If they try to take Mosul they would only do so with a high degree of confidence (high number of trained troops, Kurdish and international support, already secured more land to the south, be in a position to encircle Mosul) so the success rate is likely to be higher given that all of these elements would likely be in place. Confidence level would probably need to be above 70% - so I\u2019m setting the chance  of success at that level.

My analysis builds on several of them.  \nThe anti-IS forces can be the Turks, from the north, the Iraqi's from the South, and the Kurds from the east.  The US will not act alone because of previous experience and the political environment.  The timeline is 11 months.\nThe Iraqi's are preparing to retake Ramadi with US and Ally assistance.  That will significantly lower their chance of meeting the deadline.  I will give them 5% chance of diverting their forces to the North and successfully dislodging a dug-in force.\nThe Turks are looking more likely to attack IS this year according to Stratfor.  However, they appear to be more concerned with Syria than Iraq and the Iraqi Government warned them to keep out of Iraq when they sent in a small security force.  They would also need to secure a line of communication (LOC) that is rather exposed.  I will give that 5%.\nMost likely of the three are the Kurd's desire for Mosul.  They want the city but Iraq will not let them have it as part of their region.  If they try to secure it from IS they are likely to get tepid, if any, support from Baghdad.  Can they do it in 11 months?  Unlikely if the thorough analysis by @vanderMEI is an indicator.  I will give the Kurds 20% and take away 5% for timeline.    The next big question is if the dam will hold out.  It appears to be lacking in maintenance.  But it is in everyone's interest that it holds.  If it becomes a serious problem you may even find it as an area to compromise in.  If it does burst and flood the city then it becomes a question of who retakes it after the waters recede.  The Turks have no more incentive than before, the Iraqi's will have their own problems in Baghdad which again leaves the Kurd's.  There is high ground directly to the west of the city and the IS forces could probably remain closer to the ruins mixed in with the fleeing population.  The question then becomes, who wants a flooded city in need of a new powerplant and infrastructure.  The Kurd's might if they are looking long term.  I will give the Kurd's another 5% for running faster than IS into the muddy plains.  But what if the Kurds deliberately, and clandestinely, blow the dam?  Then they are rid of IS, have a natural barrier between them, and leave Baghdad too busy to object to their takeover.  I will give them 10% for guile and luck.   The final option left is unilateral withdrawal.  They can either leave on their own or be forced to withdraw by conditions.  They will not leave on their own because they are building the caliphate and must have territory to do that.  Additionally, they believe that all the Jihadi's must die in order for the world to end correctly.  So it will take events elsewhere to force them to withdraw.  Could a Turkish attack force them to leave as they consolidate forces.  This is a real possibility if Turkey really attacks deep inside of Syria.  I will allow 10% for that.  None of the other attacks, air or otherwise, are severe enough to warrant a change - yet.   The key factors for moving the chance up or down will be Turkey's intention, the dam's maintenance status, and the Kurd's readiness to commit.

Apologies for that. To resolve this question, it seems to me that one must first understand why Mosul would be a priority target for anti-ISIS forces - of which there are many and of disparate motivation. I understand why we in the west might consider it a priority as we here demand big prizes for big news and political gain. With our European model of war and conquest, cities matter and big cities matter more. For the other players however - those on the scene with their lives, families, clans, and tribes on the line, the motivation is not as clear. Theirs is not an urban world of states and nations. For these folks I think the best way to come to grips with this is to remove the Sikes/Picot nation state borders and view that landscape in its historic ethnographic sense. This is, it seems to me, important as it will be these many and different ethnographic groups who will be tasked with doing the fighting and dying and it\u2019s well worth asking what\u2019s in it for them. If you then decide that Mosul is not the prize we here think it to be it\u2019s an easier task to resolve the question - will Mosul fall if too few local players care enough that it does? Meticulous calculations of battle strategy and tactics may then become moot. Which is good, because no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.  If you are committed to the Iraqi state as it once was the answer is clear - Mosul is an important priority objective. Some parts of the Iraqi State and surviving institutions would clearly feel this way along with their superpower sponsors. The oil and other revenue sources a large urban area provides matters in this regard. There is also the overarching war against ISIS in its totality, however for all but the western powers, that is a strategic imperative that may be less a motivation at the local level. But who else among the anti-ISIS forces is committed to that nation state cause or the larger war above any other motivation they might have? This is where it gets tricky and the ethnographic model is helpful. The existing Iraqi state, it\u2019s institutions, and its army are for all intents and purposes Shiite, as are the Militias that are semi autonomous and have formed the backbone of the effort to drive ISIS away from the Shiite heartland and its shrines to the south of Baghdad. These folks are hated north of there where Sunni Jaziran Arabs dominate, and who were the victims of these Shiite groups and the reason ISIS was able to \u201cliberate\u201d the area from them so easily. Historically, these Shiite groups have had little interest in these foreign areas and there is little to gain for the tribes and clans that make up the bulk of the Iraqi fighting forces in fighting and dying for this region. There are already problems developing in Ramadi, Haditha, and Fallujha, all heavily Sunni areas along the Euphrates river north west of and a short drive from Baghdad. Shiite forces of any kind holding these near areas may be in for a long and terrible haul but an essential one as they provide the shield which protects vital Shiite shrines like those in Karbala from ISIS attack. I see little strategic imperative for local tribes in stripping these forces for an advance further into the Sunni north, especially an astonishing 400km\u2019s to Mosul. Except for the defense of the Shiite south, there is literally nothing in it for these southern Shiite tribes and clans. They would be a long way from home, in foreign land, and for no strategic gain to them greater than what they have now. The Militias in particular were raised for defense of the shrines in a time of crisis by Grand Ayatollah Sistani, and were never given the task of offense in the service of the corrupt nation state. While Mosul itself is a polyglot, it sits in a historically Sunni area to one side, and Kurd to the other. There is not now or ever has been much if any Shiite influence. Without a committed and driven Shiite force it would be up to the local Kurdish and Sunni tribes to do the dying necessary to oust ISIS on the Ramadi model. Who would that be? I can\u2019t say. But I can say that if the Kurds had designs on Mosul and were able they would have done it before ISIS became entrenched. They may not have the wherewithal but more importantly, they would put themselves in conflict with the Iraqi state who would demand Mosul be returned. The Kurds would have to wrest Mosul from local Sunni extremists and then face down the Shiite state who wants it back. And of course, there are the Turks and Iranians to deal with. There appears to be nothing worth that cost to them at this point. Their best interest would be in consolidating what they have for the inevitable carving of the spoils once the Iraqi state collapses for good. As for the local Sunni\u2019s, a good portion of their clans have been either co-opted by ISIS as a defense against the Shiite state, or at a minimum, cowed into silence. If Mosul were to expel ISIS it would have to be with the active participation of Sunni\u2019s who would rather have the horror of a Shiite return over that of a Sunni extremist occupation. Thus far, there are no signs of anyone making that choice. In summary, there just doesn\u2019t appear to be enough motivation by enough players to fight and die for Mosul. Except for the wreck of the Iraqi nation state and its western backers, no one seems to have much interest in disturbing the status quo at this time or in the foreseeable future.

The Ramadi \"Victory\" seems delusional to me. A more correct adjective would the Ramadi Destruction.\n...the push into Ramadi cannot yet be regarded as decisive. First, it took the Iraqi military seven long months \u2014 since May 2015 \u2014 to make progress into the central neighborhoods of the city. Since the past summer, with the help of the US Air Force, Baghdad has been repeatedly unable to dislodge IS militants. A state military force deploying the latest weapons, operationally supported by the United States with air cover and, reportedly, ground troops, accompanied by Iran\u2019s top military commanders, US-armed tribesmen and led by vengeful sectarian militias has been haphazardly fighting for more than half a year for a mid-size city 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Baghdad that it should not have lost in the first place and which was seized as an afterthought by a nonstate armed group that had already won the prize in Mosul.\nSecond, since Ramadi has been declared \"liberated,\" IS has stepped up its urban guerrilla tactics with deadly results for the elite Iraqi troops. Observer tribesmen claim that the group still controls a third of the city, and there are reports of neighborhoods with the IS flag flying within a hundred meters of the national troops. In the midst of a devastated city, we are at best looking at a prolonged tit-for-tat phase of factional advance-and-retreat cycles previously witnessed elsewhere, notably in Fallujah. In truth, the price paid by the Iraqi military and the US forces in Ramadi is already too high. The strategy they worked on for the past months is now known to IS, which wasted no time in switching in situ to suicide-attack mode and withdrew its fighters to \"stretch the enemy,\" keeping them in expectation of a possible counterattack. There are already indications of the Iraqi authorities overplaying their hand with statements that IS will be defeated in 2016 and Mosul is next.\nFinally, and most revealingly, Ramadi is arguably not that important for IS.

Second, since Ramadi has been declared \"liberated,\" IS has stepped up its urban guerrilla tactics with deadly results for the elite Iraqi troops.

The countries actively fighting ISIL are doing so mainly in a tactical manner and in their own interests, without an overarching plan to genuinely defeat ISIL. Trying to reduce financial resources to ISIL through U.N. cooperation is encouraging, but not nearly enough. The recent Sunni/Shia regional differences couldn\u2019t come at a better time for ISIL and something it has been trying to foment since Zarqawi\u2019s time.   ISIL has many resources besides oil to rely on. Because of crime and corruption in many countries, there is still a stream of income it can rely upon to distribute as needed and where needed. Even items like black market cigarettes and other contraband bring in a fair amount of money.    ISIL still has no problem at the moment recruiting replacements. It also has military leaders who have the ability to initiate kinetic activity in many countries at almost any time it chooses. The attack on Haditha will divert attention and resources from any major projects like Mosul. The dam is vital to the area.

As this is a partisan war, the best place to start is to look at the map and what happened in the last 12 months. Here the BBC has a neat interactive map:\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27838034\nIt is important to note two features:\n1. More bombing runs in Iraqi than in Syria and they are concentrated on the Mosul area.\u00a0\n2. Mosul is the main link into Iraq, yet despite this their financing and power is barely changed in that region.\u00a0 The re-capture of Ramadi is important but rather sad. It is like a 15 minute drive down the motorway from Baghdag. Even that took 6 months and the Iraqi forces only really got the center. To me it means that the Iraqi's alone would have great difficulties getting up to Mosul, they would need to capture huge patches of land and as few key cities, like the entire Baiji-region. --> Iraqi cannot do it alone.\u00a0\nTo the Irbil/Sinjar front. Here the Kurds are in the lead. Compared to the strong-hold of Mosul with their new US and Russian weapons, the Kurds are heavily out-numbered and out-gunned. Yes, they took back Sinjar, a key outpost, but let's be honest, it was deserted. ISIS will just move goods via Haditha or through the hills (minor roads). --> the Kurds cannot do it alone.\nTo the main front Kobane and Raqqa. This is a disoriented front. On the one side the Russians are taking out the Assad resistance by air on on the other side allied bombing runs are doing little to subdue the power influence in Raqqa. Who is supposed to lead the way as likely Raqqa should fall before Mosul? Raqqa is the political capital, but Mosul is the economic capital of ISIS. Gold wins wars, so in my opinion Mosul will be more difficult than Raqqa, meaning Raqqa must fall first. However, there are little ground forces able or capable of doing so. --> Northern Syria will not be re-captured anytime soon.\u00a0\nThis brings my to the essence of the question: Without a Western-led (hence US-led, as the French are hopeless in war) offensive with significant ground forces, Mosul will not fall, especially not within 12 months. So, one must pose the difficult question: what is the likelihood of NATO or the UN sending in a full functional army into Syria and Iraq? In essence a full-scale war. One must ask the rude question \"what's in it for me\"? Reduction of terrorists activity and lowering the wave of immigrants might not be solved this way, so there has to be a huge economic benefit. At 35-40$/bbl of oil, I somehow doubt that we (The West) truly see one. There is no rush, and since the GJOpen question is time related, let us focus on that key element.\u00a0\nGulf War I (i.e. the liberation of Kuwait) was resolved within 5 weeks of ground forces deployment, so the affectiveness cannot be questioned, only the time to get all the approvals and personnel in place. Obama is strictly against another Gulf War, meaning the EU nations must lead the way\u2026this will take to long to pass through the regional and international parliaments. I suspect that gathering a non-US led coalition force from Europe that can act shiftily would take way more than 12 months. Bottom-line, wars are not won with air-strikes and the locals on the ground are too weak. A major terrorist attack (+1000 casualties) would truly change the current opinions and motivation. Likelihood is dropping though.\u00a0\nSo: 4 major hurdles hurdles and a major mood change, let's compound them: 1*2*3*4*5 = 120 / 100 = 1,2% chance.

Ramadi is closer to Baghdad and further from Syria and ISIS \"heartlands.\" This means that it would be easier for the Iraqi army to cut supply lines and get its own troops to the area. \n2. Mosul is Sunni. The Iraq army is mostly Shia. The Iraqi defence forces that were supposed to stop ISIS simply threw down their weapons and left when ISIS approached. Similarly, Kurds would not have an easy time taking the city and have no interest in taking areas they can't hold. \n3. Since Pres. Obama is in office through mid-January 2018, even if a hawk is elected to the White House, short of a black swan event, it is unlikely that US or other foreign troops will be in the area to re-take the city. \n4. It took months of preparation and fighting to re-take Ramadi, which had a war-time population of around 70k people. Mosul is much, much larger (600k people). Many of these people may not be fans of ISIS but are even less enchanted by the idea of Americans, Kurds or Sunnis in control.  Unless the coalition can somehow convince Sunni tribal leaders to field a massive armed force, it is unlikely Mosul will be taken any time soon.

Many of the other commentators have done a good job of analyzing the difficulties the Iraqi Army will have in rapidly shifting from Ramadi to Mosul to take Mosul by 1 Jan.  After they finish Ramadi, which will take a few months more to consolidate, the IA will then have to lick its wounds and prepare for the next operation.  (and everything will slow down for the summer) While they say that the next operation is Mosul, and the US is certainly pressuring them to go for Mosul, they will have a decision point.  There is one strategic factor about this decision point that I have not seen discussed.  The Baghdad government has no incentive to remove threats against the Kurds.  As soon as the Iraqi Army retakes Mosul, then Barzani and the KRG are safe from the ISIL threat, meaning that they then have fewer constraints on \"misbehavior\" (from Baghdad's perspective): actions that promote KRG independence, just like they were doing before the fall of Mosul.  So why would Baghdad sacrifice Shia blood to remove a threat to the KRG before they have to? So it seems doubtful that they will put a lot of pressure from the top to make the operation happen quickly.  And to make it happen before 1 Jan 17 would require a lot of command pressure to overcome the Iraqi's army's risk aversion, organizational problems, force generation, overcoming losses, etc.\nOn the other hand, I bumped my prediction back up from a low around 5-10% to account for the non-zero chance of a rapid ISIL collapse (partial or total).  War is the realm of chance after all.  There are numerous indications of the effects of attrition on ISIL.  There are two possible models for this, a rapid \"wild fire\" collapse or a slow fight to the end.  Their performance to date would favor the attritional slugfest.  However, the complexity of human institutions in violent conflict leads to unpredictable outcomes.  \nAnother possibility is an ISIL decision to not contest Mosul, which could lead to an earlier far to the IA.  The precedent for this is Tal Abyad, which ISIL chose to not fight for.  Not fighting for Mosul would be a much more momentous decision, however, so I do not think this is a high probability outcome, just possible."], [4273, "2015-12-28T03:33:07Z", [0.3], ""], [52, "2015-12-28T03:13:55Z", [0.63], ""], [754, "2015-12-28T02:53:59Z", [0.67], ""], [1122, "2015-12-28T02:51:55Z", [0.45], ""], [13652, "2015-12-28T02:48:29Z", [0.77], "pressure mounting on obama to act"], [7463, "2015-12-28T01:44:02Z", [0.9], ""], [11785, "2015-12-28T01:40:11Z", [0.05], "Daily Beast is not the most credible source but this article lends support to my position:\n http://google.com/newsstand/s/CBIwscyY_yM "], [8229, "2015-12-28T01:29:08Z", [0.05], "Too many global powers for them to under take any offensive operations that far inside Iraq."], [12163, "2015-12-28T01:02:32Z", [0.75], ""], [14023, "2015-12-28T00:27:16Z", [0.75], "Obama will be shamed into action"], [12663, "2015-12-28T00:21:23Z", [0.9], ""], [1333, "2015-12-28T00:10:51Z", [0.17], "Lastly - and I mean it this time - WITHOUT A common enemy THE STAGE COULD BE SET FOR THE NATURAL CLEAVING OF THE NATION OF Iraq INTO ITS 3 RESPECTIVE COMPONENTS!

Daesh carefully engaged the Sunni and Baathist parties that were disenfranchised by the Maliki Gov't (which I cannot find enough descriptive phrases with which to express their level of incompetency.) What Daesh did do was unite Maliki's enemies, and used Gold before Lead to cement alliances, collecting back the gold later and eradicating competition from those who thought they would co rule with Baghdadi. The Sunni and Baathists who were attracted to IS in the 1st place have still not found satisfaction so will not be eagerly awaiting redemption but rather living in fear of of retribution. Gold is in short supply now though, so black mail will be Daesh's stock in trade to encourage their former allies to help them again lest they be exposed.

IF Ramadi was a U.S. led operation our doctrine would call for armor to exploit the rout and pursue them.

If however, iraq did the heavy lifting and Iran wants to show their ass over coalition air support and solidfy their positions to repel a counter attack, There we will see celebration and recruiting for the Shia Militias take place instead of hot pursuit.

The same day, another Iraqi official said that all the foreign Islamic State fighters had left Ramadi and that scores of local fighters remained behind.

It is only one of many sources to consider for the question presented.  So, my overall thoughts at the moment regarding a force trying to retake Mosul - fractionalized Iraqi military, Iraqi government with diminishing monetary resources, surrounding countries that each have different hegemonic interests in Northern Iraq. Why the U.S. and Iraq need a Victory in Ramadi - October 14, 2015\nA U.S. military spokesman for the anti-Islamic State coalition in Iraq, Col. Steve Warren, announced Tuesday that the Iraqi army is ready to retake the city of Ramadi. According to information leaked to reporters, Iraqi forces have moved to about 14 kilometers (9 miles) from the city's outskirts and an assault against Islamic State positions is likely imminent. Washington is reportedly pushing for the Iraqis to retake the city as quickly as possible. Baghdad and Washington are both in need of a victory against the Islamic State; Washington needs to demonstrate success in the face of growing Russian involvement in the Middle East, and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's government is beleaguered by a growing protest movement, budget shortfalls and disintegrating ties between Iraq's Shiite, Sunni Arab and Kurdish populations. Sixteen months after Mosul fell to the Islamic State, Iraq remains in a precarious position. Declining oil prices have removed Baghdad's most salient tool \u2014 petrodollars \u2014 for dealing with competing minority demands. Despite their own oil reserves, the Kurds have been unable to reverse the economic decline that played a part in sending their political climate into disarray.\nBaghdad has struggled to regain control of Ramadi since the Islamic State advanced in May 2014, and the group's position in Anbar province has both created and exacerbated tension between Iraq's Sunni Arabs and Baghdad. Sunni Arab tribes have long pushed for formal inclusion in the Iraqi military through the creation of a national guard \u2014 something Baghdad has traditionally rejected, often at the behest of Shiite militias and their patrons in Iran. Without greater Sunni Arab participation in the fight against the Islamic State, the Iraqi side of the campaign has largely stalled in recent months; Iranian-backed Shiite elements and the remnants of the Iraqi military have found it difficult to push northward past Salahuddin province. The Islamic State's Iraqi stronghold of Mosul, dangerously close to the southern boundaries of Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region, has thus remained beyond Iraqi forces' reach. The Kurdish peshmerga, many armed and trained by the United States, have been largely successful in managing their border against Islamic State incursions. However, like Iraq's Sunni Arabs, the peshmerga are uneasy about working with Baghdad. Security concerns, mounting debts and financial shortfalls are taking their toll on Arbil, where a longstanding debate over extending Kurdish President Massoud Barzani's term has devolved into an imbroglio involving the ousting of the reform-minded Gorran coalition from the government. Barzani faces stiff opposition from the Kurdistan Democratic Party's political rivals. Though he is attempting to break out of the impasse by kicking Gorran out of the government and hoping to strike a bargain with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Kurdistan Islamic Union, the move is likely to backfire and create even more room for Iran, which has tight links with Gorran, to push back against Barzani and, by extension, Turkey. Iraq's Shiites are also experiencing internal conflict, including an anti-corruption movement that began in August holding weekly protests to demand reform in Baghdad. Shiite political forces of all stripes are poised to expand their influence in the Iraqi capital as al-Abadi struggles to accommodate competing sectarian and ethnic interests as well as Russian, Iranian, Turkish and Gulf Arab machinations. The Iraqi government announced Oct. 11 that it was sacking plans to issue a debt tender for $6 billion to $7 billion because of excessively high interest payments that Baghdad would be unable to afford. In recent weeks, rumors have emerged of Gulf Arab or even U.S. loans to Baghdad in addition to emergency funding the International Monetary Fund provided earlier in the year. The Iraqi government is in need of a victory, but if previous offensives against Islamist State positions are any indication, the Iraqi army and allied Shiite militias do not have an easy task ahead of them. U.S. pressure on Iraq to press ahead on Ramadi might indicate increased U.S. air and logistical support for the Iraqi army, especially since Washington is re-evaluating its Iraq and anti-Islamic State strategies as Russia lends support to the Syrian government. The United States is also preparing to deliver the second half of a long-delayed shipment of F-16 fighter aircraft to Baghdad as part of Washington's attempts to maintain its own influence in Iraq. The U.S. push for Iraqi troops to retake Ramadi certainly highlights the larger struggle in Iraq and the region as each country attempts to use Iraq's current struggles for its own ambitions. As Tehran works to maintain its patron-client relationship with Baghdad, both Turkey and the Gulf Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia, are looking to strengthen ties with Iraq's Kurdish and Sunni Arab populations. Both Washington and Baghdad will tout a victory against the Islamic State in Ramadi, but the battle's overall impact for Iraq will be minimal. Lower oil prices will persist and challenge the Iraqi economy. Moreover, pushing out jihadist fighters into the western Iraqi deserts or sympathetic tribal communities will not mend the ethnic and sectarian rifts that have plagued the country for generations. Iraq's continued weakness and internal divisions will not only complicate anti-Islamic State operations but also will intensify the regional competition among Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran. Situation Report - 12/24/15 -\nIraq's armed forces will move to retake the major northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State once they capture the western city of Ramadi, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Dec. 25, Reuters reported. Capturing Mosul would deprive the militant group of its biggest population center, a major source of funding and influence. The capture of Ramadi would also give the army a major boost in its move toward Mosul, which the Islamic State took in 2014. The cities are about 420 kilometers (260 miles) apart by road.

Recent IS attempts to break out by attacking surrounding Kurdish positions were unsuccessful, this can be seen as a desperate throw of the dice by IS. Current conditions require IS fighters (who are on the whole relatively poorly trained and ill disciplined) to live in underground conditions, with limited mobility, supplies or communications. The effects on morale will be debilitating, leading to clashes between IS foreign fighters and local fighters.\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga will hold firm against any breakout attempts and  with coalition support deny IS supply from the North and East. Meanwhile the Iraqi forces will build a coalition with Sunni tribal groups, that will lead to the erosion of IS control in areas to the west and south, cutting the remaining supply routes with Raqaa in Syria. An assault on Mosul in April-June 2016 is likely and IS will crumble within two months.\nThe long term impact of IS occupation (which began covertly as long ago as 2008 but will have been formally exercised for 2 years) will require significant commitment from the Iraqi government to reverse especially when dealing with issues such as child soldiers, traumatised women/family units, UXO and inter communal relations amongst returnees and the resident community."], [706, "2015-12-26T05:32:37Z", [0.99], "Ramadi will encourage the Iraqi forces and its coalition trainers, and Mosul lies close to the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, proven IS wreckers.  An entire year for this to happen?  I count on it!"], [13947, "2015-12-26T03:45:52Z", [0.15], "Here is what I believe to be needed for a successful recapture of Mosul. I have no military experience whatsoever, it just seems like the logical scenario to me: Before government forces march for Mosul, taking the pressure off of Baghdad by removing the threat of ISIS and other anti-government forces in the Anbar province (particularily in Fallujah and Hit) is required. This would allow to free up a large number of troops which are needed for future operations. The battle for Ramadi showed that the government is unwilling to cooperate with uncontrolled ideology-driven Shiia militias prone to war crime (a wise move that will nevertheless slow things down) so troops are very much needed. Also I'd like to note that each city capture so far took around 2 months to execute, these things don't seem to be easy.  After dealing with imminent threats the army could theoretically march straight through the desert and for Mosul but securing Hawija and establishing stable supply lines for a siege that I believe will be a months long, drawn out humanitarian catastrophe could be a smart thing to do beforehand. Taking Al Ba'al or (rather) Tal Afar to the west would cut Mosul and it's surrounding areas from Syria and stop the influx of new ISIS shitheads which also seams to be a not-dumb move and so the operation could hinge on Kurds securing those areas as well. After that we've got a siege of a heavily fortified 1 milion Sunni city conducted by a joint army of Shiite government forces and Kurds.  Trenches are built and minefields set up already and this would be the center of ISIS operations in the whole of Iraq under assault. Ramadi proved that even 400 men can fight off 10.000 troops and slow their advance for two months. Tikrit defended by ~10.000 ISIS fighters required an army three times that size to take and largely ISIS fighters just fled. Here we've got the last stronghold under attack. That's probably the hometown of over a dozen thousand of Iraqi fighters. If they lose, they're finished, I would fight to my death if I were them.  For retaking Mosul I would think that a force of minimum 60.000 (80.000 sounds more reasonable) men would be needed. Also somwhere along the way a reinforced American contingent should be sent to guide bombings and instruct Iraqi troops. Direct involvement of ground troops of any western power (including Turkey) in Iraq is unlikely and I get the impression that the help of Iran and their militias is treated as a last resort kind of thing. Other than just physically encircling the city there are two requirements for the success of the operation. First of all they have to get there. ISIS as a whole must be significantly weakened to make a land offensive effective. Secondly an army large enough for a successful siege must be mustered. The first requirement is best achieved by blowing up oil trucks and pumpjacks in Syria. Weakening ISIS financially destabilises the organisation internally and causes a loss of support as taxes and extortions increas and standards of living fall. Closing the border with Turkey north of Aleppo by the Kurds would be a significant blow to the weapons, foreign fighters and money supply. Another huge setback, though highly unlikely, would be a peace agreement between the Syrian government and rebels. As of the army... It's hard to find any realistic assessment of the present state of the Iraqi military. From the numbers it seems they've got the manpower and equippment, but still http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=iraq ranks them only 112 of 126, roughly on par with Namibia, which has like 10 tanks.
