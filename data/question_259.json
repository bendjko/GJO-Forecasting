For the approx. 10% undecided voters, I think name recognition / inertia and expected higher media spending favor Toomey.  Also, the latest stories indicate that more voters are registering Republican vs. Democrat in Pennsylvania, which is another point for Toomey Pennsylvania unemployment has also tracked below the national average, which I think is another positive for Toomey.

Trump has only a 14.7% chance to win PA based on fivethirtyeight's polls only forecast. Toomey seems to have two disadvantages, as I see it. If polling trends more towards Clinton in the presidential race, Toomey could be susceptible to Republicans staying at home on election day because of a possible landslide presidential election. However, this is likely mitigated somewhat due to PA's Eastern Time Zone location and the voting block voting before election results are in. Toomey also faces the problem of having to count on many Hilary and third party voting to vote across the ticket in order to win. Split ticket voting is down significantly, particularly in the 2012 election, according to the Washington Post.
