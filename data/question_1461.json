Not only will additional CO2 be set free, but also the capacity of sinking CO2 for the future is then reduced. Just by a flight of fancy, there may be even a statistical side effect and distortion based on the relative geographical proximity of CA and the NOAA's observatory on Hawaii (at least one of the four stations mentioned in the source): \n\"The estimated daily global seasonal cycle and trend value for CO2 are determined from the daily averaged CO2 data from the four NOAA/ESRL/GMD Baseline observatories.\" Mauna Loa, Hawaii must be one of them, maybe even Barrow, Alaska will early detect a raised CO2 concentration due to the CA wildfires in the next weeks. The other two are obviously in American Samoa and on South Pole, Antarctica. \nAccording to my understanding of physical processes like diffusion, the additional CO2 from wildfires will not be immediately spread evenly across the global atmosphere but the highest concentrations will be observed in the place of origin, of course, an then will reduce correlated to the squared (or cubic?) distance to origin. So at least one of four observatories may observe a temporary significant shift upwards that creates noise which is hard to be corrected for.\nThe same effect was obviously noticed in the Boulder aerosol measurements in Boulder, CO, as the ESRL published\nhttps://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/smoke.html The website\nhttps://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ may provide useful info and further reading, resources and news on this question's topic, such as: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/ https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/\n(that's probably where the source .txt-file is linked from) https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/covid2.html Just by chance I stumbled upon the ESRL's \"Rapid Refresh\" resources. Concerning the duration of the wildfires, there's hardly any hope for it to end soon by the assistance of rainfalls, as the relative humidity in the 850hPa surface shows:\nhttps://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/displayImage.cgi?image=rh850image&width=806&model=rr&title=RAP\nThe whole west coast, large areas of the Pacific offshore, shows extremely dry air with relative humidity of 20% or less (maybe even caused by the fires themselves...) I'll have to go through all of this in time, for now it seems to be wise to be on the higher end of scale. EDIT: Maybe I've found the solution for myself by just reducing complexity (focusing on the Mauna Loa/HI data, and with the help of this interactive plot: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/graph.html Trend for August 2020 is 414.48ppm for this observatory alone.\nComparison of the \"November 2019\" value (which may be either a monthly average or the 30 Nov 2019-value) with the global value (cyclical and trend) of 30 Nov 2019 in the .txt-file \n\"co2: 410.25\" and \"trend:412.26\" versus 411.37 and 411.27 (as retrieved on 13 September 2020/reported on 12 Sep 2020)\nshows that \n/first, by the time of the question's resolution, global cyclical and  trend value tend to be almost identical, while the cyclical value (the one that resolves the question) is still likely to be slightly higher by .1ppm\n/second, the Mauna Loa,HI \"trend\" value tends to be roughly 1.00ppm higher than the global value. Then, approximation of growth from today's values to 01 Dec 2020 can be done by retrieving the Mauna Loa, HI values of August 2019\n\"co2: 409.95\" and \"trend: 411.87\".\nSo over the three months Sep, Oct, Nov 2019 the trend grew by 0.39ppm Adding this to latest August 2020 \"trend\" value of 414.48ppm but deducting from it the 1.00ppm by which Mauna Loa, HI tops the global value, I receive 413.85ppm.\nAdding the .1ppm by which the global cyclical value tops the trend in the November stats, I receive 413.95ppm.\nI wonder if it has an impact on that approximation that we're not at any month's end right now, but don't think so.\nIf that is a correct method, it's getting weird and very close.\nHowever, I still believe if the values are tipping in 2020, it's rather going to tip to the upside.

After accounting for the average difference between the December whole-month mean value and the mean 1 December value, It appears that in order to remain below 414 PPM, the month-month rate of change between each month over the rest of 2020 would need to average only a little below the average rate of change (~1/7 of a standard deviation) for those months over the last 10 years.  Distinctly possible; over the last ten years, this seems to have happened over the last four months of the year a couple of times, most notably in 2013.

As of this writing (almost halfway through August), the Jul-Aug change appears well above the average; it\u2019s possible that this could suggest a rate of change beginning to run above normal, but more likely that it\u2019s just an artifact of where we are in the month and of no real diagnostic value:  CO2 concentration values averaged over the first two weeks of August have consistently been ~.21 PPM higher than the whole-month average values; correcting for that brings the rate of change right back on trend.

For the 2019 season the June ev sank, probably because of a warmer than average spring and an earlier than average beginning of the growing period in the northern hemisphere. 2020 June ev was in May actually, as this year's traffic emissions have been extraordinarily low, as the 2020 values may be exceptional as a whole! Jul evs of the following year (e.g. 14 Jul 2018 for 2017 season) tend to be ever later and will have shifted this year by 2 to 3 days to est. 15 Jul 2020 for 2019 season. This shift indicates that total emissions are still growing yoy, even though traffic with it's less than 20% share in total emissions globally will have been cut in half in 2020. Two sources of emissions at the moment will (over-)compensate for the reductions in traffic:\nWildfires in the amazon region are at their worst extension in the last decade.\nAnd, maybe even more important, permafrost grounds in northern Siberia are currently melting with temperatures at above 30\u00b0C in some places, more than 20K above what is normal. This sets free large amounts of methane that will migrate to higher strata of the atmosphere, where the molecules have a lifetime of about 90 days (causing a strong greenhouse effect) and then dissolve into H2O and CO2 probably. Wildfires in Siberia have led to an emission of 59 megatons of CO2 in the past 18 months, more than in the 16 years before combined. I think gas production will have released considerable amounts of natural gas (methane, ethane) into the air, as production of gas seems hard to regulate down, while heating consumption was low in Europe during winter 2019/20 and industrial demand and consumption will have crashed in Q1 and the first half of Q2 2020. Global deforestation makes it increasingly difficult for biomass to bind the carbon in carbon(di)oxide and to recycle CO2 to O2, and oceans have warmed, and saturated and soured to an extent that oceans will no longer absorb but rather release additional CO2. In all, I expect a 01 Dec 2020-value that is in line with the four year-trend and will lie only ~0.4ppm below previous (2019) season's maximum 26 Apr - 04 May 2020 of 414.53, at est. 414.11ppm CO2."], [172, "2020-07-07T01:38:45Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], "Crap shoot, currently on track to slightly exceed 414.

So as a base case option 2 seems most likely.  On risks to the downside, the COVID driven reduction in economic activity is likely to be truly unprecedented and there is a chance emissions could fall by a much larger level.

The data to be used for the resolution of this question are unusual.  Instead of raw measurements, average smoothed data are used. CO2 measurements, as in most geophysical data, are rather noisy.  For stable estimates, scientists are not interested in the noise in the data and came up with various ways to smooth the measurements and remove the noise.  According to the headers in the Global Trends in CO2 dataset [1], the \u201ccycle\u201d data column (which determines the outcome of the forecast) comes from averaging four \u201csmoothed\u201d datasets. Each dataset is least squares fitted to a long-term trend (a second order polynomial) and annual oscillations (4 yearly harmonics).  The residuals from the smoothed fitting is low-passed filtered to remove short term variability (i.e. 50-day or shorter variations are removed).  The filtered residuals are added back to the long-term trend and annual oscillation curves [2].  Finally the 4 \u201csmoothed\u201d datasets are averaged and put as the \u201ccycle\u201d column of the Global Trends in CO2 dataset [1]. Both the long-term trend and annual oscillations in the data are rather stable over time.  The long-term trend represents the increasing in CO2 over time. Despite of the various international calls for the reduction of greenhouse gases, it does not change (especially flattening) much over the years.  The annual oscillations are driven by biology, chemistry and physics, associated with seasonal variations in human energy usage, vegetation growth and decay, etc.  They, too, are stable over the years unless there are some large scale catastrophic events. When the 10-year averaged smoothed data are curve-fitted using the same curve-fitting methodology as the data, the residuals represent local variations of CO2 measurements.  Since we are only interested in the global long-term values, deviations from the fitted curve are treated as random noise.  The scheme that I used is to use the fitted curve to predict the future (~300 days in the future) value and use the residuals to determine the error (and probabilities) of the prediction.\nThe underlying assumption in this approach is the fitted curve is almost perfect (see consistence check below) in predicting values ~300 day in the future, and errors in the prediction are random errors.  In my previous forecast [3], the random errors are assumption to be Gaussian.  In this forecast update, the actual empirical probability distribution is used instead since I found that the distribution.  The probabilities are not that different from the Gaussian case.

Now for the forecast itself and the probabilities in it: 1. The reason I accounted a 20% probability for the value to be below the calculated prediction is that I have to take into account factors that are likely to contribute to lower CO2 emission levels. I'm not talking about EU's attempts to limit traffic, get more renewable energy produced and so on - it's a nice effort and I support it, but the impact takes too long to have an effect and at a global scale it's a drop in the CO2 ocean we're swimming (or breathing) in. What could get those levels significantly lower would be economic reasons that have an impact on the consumption of traditional fuels, a global recession that leads to job losses and factories being shut down, high oil prices leading to people having to use public transport instead of their private cars; a new beef related virus leading to a lot of them being dead or killed; etc.  You name it, but there are events that can lead to a lower CO2 emission and thus I had to integrate their cumulated probability in the forecast. 2. The reason I accounted a much higher probability (75%) of the value hitting the \"target\" 414 to 416 is... nothing's going to change that much in our behavior and thus we'll see another year with an increase in the CO2 emission rates. There's actually a good chance to go above a value close to 414 and see something above or equal to 415. We're seeing some help from the Australia fires, we might see another year with similar catastrophes in California, the fact we're heating up the climate doesn't help us lowering the CO2 emission levels. The population is going to grow following, again, an exponential growth and they are not going to turn vegan overnight \u2013 that means meat production will also go up, more animals, more CO2 emissions. Around the world, liberal economies are struggling to get the promised growth of a few percent each year, allowing more purchasing power for each individual consumer, allowing more people to buy cars, eat more and consume more energy (part of it being obtained from conventional fuels) \u2013 an increase of one leads to the increase of the other. We can think of a lot of scenarios where it is likely to see a lot of CO2 burned in the atmosphere, even a conflict having an effect on certain industries to power up their engines more. 3. A 5% chance to see a higher than 416ppm value. A reason for allocating those percents to a higher value can be found on points 1 and 2, but having a cumulated effect. We also need to remember's Taleb's favorite bird, the Black Swan, if we get such events, though their nature is unpredictable, one could argue they are likely to increase the emissions rather than lowering them. I find it hard to believe that before 2021 we'll get some alien technology that lower's the CO2 levels overnight or that algae that consume CO2 will spread around half of the worlds oceans. Imagining scenarios which lead to high CO2 values are more likely and easier to picture, hence reserving those percents here.

By the same argument, >=416ppm barely registers. So it seems we agree on the end-points. The [412, 414] range is almost entirely given in the 0.975 level, so we should give it 0.975 really. This leaves 2.5% for the [414, 416] range, even though the fit (413.994) is the \"most likely value\" and in this range. That means that @Hammer-Time and my forecasts disagree: Is [412, 414] the most likely or [414, 416]? It's hard to say, and I can't see any reason to choose @Hammer-Time's approach over mine -- or vice-versa. I'm going to ameliorate my forecast down from 90% in [414, 416] and put the remaining in [412, 414].

I've revised a bit and updated my predictions a bit. I now make my methods a little more clear.  I now use day, month, and year fixed effects. We have 365 data points a year over 10 years so we certainly have the degrees of freedom to do so. @Emil, all the point estimates are super precise. Confidence intervals are absolutely tiny and as we will see, I don't think they are a good proxy for the confidence of my prediction. The key factor is that the year fixed effects vary a decent amount and hence my predictions are off by a decent amount (max 1 ppm, which about 20x what the confidence intervals suggest). As @Anneinak points out, economic growth can play a big role in year over year changes. However, I have no clue what will happen in the economy in the next year, so I'm not really sure how to factor it in.  Per @danielharan's suggestion, I now report what my prediction method would have given as the prediction for 2011-2019 and what the actual value was. This may give a good sense of the errors on my prediction.  My prediction is comprised of three parts, the intercept, the year fixed effect prediction, and the monthly fixed effect.

First, predicting a series that displays a broad trend (upward sloping) but also cycles. The cycles seem to peak in early May and reach their minimum in late August. The cycles are very constant over time. The trend also seems pretty constant, but may be increasing as global warming becomes more and more of a problem.  I'm going to try twp different techniques to forecast this question and I'll explain them below. I begin with the simpler and get more complicated.  First pass: I look at just December 1 days, from 2009 - 2019, which ignores the effects of the cycles, but obviously decreases the precision of the forecast. That series increases by 2.4 on average, with larger increases of about 3 in recent years. Since last December 1st had a value of 411.46, it suggests a prediction that puts most of the weight in the 3rd bin, a bit in the second, and very little in the two extreme bins.  Second pass: Running a fixed effects regression, where we use year and month as factors. Essentially, the year factors should pick up the trend, while the months should pick up the cycles. When I run the regression over the whole sample I find evidence of this. Months 7 through 10 have negative coefficients, and the coefficients on years are increasing each year.  I then run this out of sample by using 2009 data to predict 2010, 2009 and 2010 data to predict 2011, etc. I find that month coefficients are pretty stable, and year coefficients increase around ~2.5 a year. This gives a point estimate of 414.33. I'm not really sure how to think of the distribution.  Essentially, this second pass is rerunning the first pass but incorporating more information than just data on December 1st.  Let me know what you think, if I'm missing anything, or any broad comments.
