Unfortunately the written document, finally signed last week between the FARC and the Colombian government, still has not resulted in a \"final agreement\".   Why?  The written agreement is only a part of the FARC demands for a \"final agreement\". One additional \"demand\" by the FARC for a \"final agreement\" was the inclusion of the provisions in the constitution, in order to prevent (or at least make it more difficult) for a future government to change the laws.  The Courts indicated that a referendum was required in order to amend the constitution: hence the vote on October 2nd.

This was something that the FARC insisted on, following the Colombian habit of trying to write everything into law rather than trusting in political guarantees. .....  \u201cIt\u2019s a transitional article to guarantee that future governments comply with the agreements.\" The October 2nd vote may or may not be the final step in the \"final agreement\" between the FARC and the Colombian government, but it at least is another step in the right direction.  If the referendum fails, there is no final agreement.  The result would be a signed agreement that does not meet the FARCs requirements and is changable by future governments (for example a future Uribe gov't.).  The Santo's government and the FARC chose to hold the official signing before the referendum to provide positive news to increase the chances of passage.
