Also, the central bank added that it expects to begin slowly raising the repo rate in the middle of 2018. Interest Rate in Sweden averaged 3.22 percent from 1994 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 8.91 percent in July of 1995 and a record low of -0.50 percent in February of 2016. Ferreira (2017) Dec 20, states that: The central bank of Sweden held its benchmark interest rate at -0.5 percent on December 20th, 2017, as widely expected, saying monetary policy needs to remain expansionary for inflation to continue to be close to the 2 percent target. Also, the central bank added that it expects to begin slowly raising the repo rate in the middle of 2018.  Excerpts from the Statement by the Executive Board of the Riksbank: The economic prospects and outlook for inflation in Sweden are largely unchanged from October. Economic activity is strong and the employment rate is high. Although the decline in housing prices is expected to dampen housing investment in the coming years, the effects on GDP growth will be partly counteracted by the stronger demand from abroad (para. 1-3).
