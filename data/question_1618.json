To attack Taiwan may be a bet the PRC doesn\u2019t want to make in the next 30 days in fear of bringing the US into the mix (and Japan, Korea, and Guam, and other states with US basing). The economic ties between Taiwan and the PRC still appear fairly substantial; neither side likely wants to deny their state the benefits of those relationships.  However, due to the increase in \u2018close calls\u2019 between Taiwanese, PRC, and US forces in the area, and the PRC's use of live-fire exercises during a US-Taiwan meeting, an inadvertent lethal confrontation may occur. An outside chance of the PRC flexing military power during the US\u2019s presidential transition may also exist.

The statement today, by U.S. national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, in support of Philippines and Vietnam (see https://reut.rs/396M5mT) suggests that a lethal confrontation within the time frame of this question is now even less than it was 24 hours ago. Trying to take account of any possible confirmation bias, my view is that this statement by O'Brien was clearly intended to be a warning to PRC / PLA that in spite of current local situation in US in the aftermath of the election, the overall policy of maintaining freedom of navigation in the area is unchanged. See also the recent comments by U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger at a meeting with Japan's Suga (https://bit.ly/3lYpahm) which I see as further reinforcement of US policy in the area. Updated 20201122 This unconfirmed visit by a high level, 2 star US Admiral may vex China; see https://reut.rs/3nPBKAa. However, I doubt China will publicly take any direct action to reassert its claims against Taiwan. As below, not while the Trump administration is still in office, even if only by a token of the remaining time he has in office. Equally, considering some of the actions the Trump administration has taken since the election, one could wager that this high level visit is another 'rash' Trump directed event.  Whether China would intentionally take any action that could be stage managed as an accident for the international media, is however, a question that cannot be completely ruled out in the light of this visit. However, in the remaining time of this question, I doubt it is feasible. More likely when the new administration takes office, assuming a Biden administration. At 20201117 Although China claims Taiwan is part of China and China's PLA planes have, on a couple of occasions in 2020 crossed the Taiwan Straits centre line, on the basis of a 'lethal confrontation' meaning at least one death, I do not believe China will risk an all out confrontation with Taiwan or any of its military or milita while the Trump administration is in office. @sebawi - congratulations on The Economist World 2020 Challenge"], [11817, "2020-11-17T05:11:49Z", [0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-11-16T23:23:35Z", [0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-11-16T21:47:27Z", [0.0], ""], [88560, "2020-11-16T18:35:03Z", [0.0], ""], [14027, "2020-11-16T17:29:54Z", [0.03], ""], [1056, "2020-11-16T15:28:22Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-11-16T07:00:56Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2020-11-15T20:34:34Z", [0.0], ""], [19260, "2020-11-15T14:17:52Z", [0.0], "Passage of time."], [1034, "2020-11-15T05:02:19Z", [0.0], ""], [96945, "2020-11-15T03:36:51Z", [0.0], ""], [73183, "2020-11-14T17:37:17Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2020-11-14T06:17:46Z", [0.0], ""], [94872, "2020-11-14T00:56:15Z", [0.01], ""], [1056, "2020-11-13T23:00:43Z", [0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-11-12T21:49:16Z", [0.01], ""], [31275, "2020-11-12T18:03:45Z", [0.0], ""], [27661, "2020-11-12T10:54:37Z", [0.0], ""], [93, "2020-11-12T01:59:00Z", [0.0], ""], [180, "2020-11-12T01:36:15Z", [0.3], "Possible.

Yet the reality that Taiwan would overreact from any antagonism, plus there is more than Taiwan as a player here: Source 2: \u201cThe PLA is very clear that once a war with Taiwan breaks out, their opponent will not just be the Taiwanese military, but the US-Japan alliance and other allies in the region,\u201d said Zhou Chenming, a researcher from the Yuan Wang, a Beijing-based military science and technology institute.\nThe PLA was confident that a combined force of its aircraft-carrier groups, air force and land-based missiles was a \u201cstrong shield\u201d to prevent the US and other fleets from entering the Taiwan Strait, Zhou said.\nStill, a full-scale seaborne invasion of Taiwan would be a huge risk and some observers believe Beijing will try to impose a short, limited campaign to force the Taipei authorities to negotiate, while using its initial advantage in air power to keep US forces at bay.

Although both Taiwan and China were involved in the Vietnam war on opposing sides there was no direct conflict from what I have read. It's around 6 months until this question resolves so I'd say the base rate is about 1-2%. I have listed below factors which I believe could make conflict more or less likely: More Likely:\n- China is conducting military exercises close to Taiwan and has militia close to its border. With sabre rattling of this nature it would not take much to incite a skirmish where lives are lost.\n- Parties and individuals in favour of independence are in power in Taiwan.\n- The West is distracted by Covid-19 and may be unable to oppose any Chinese aggression in the region.\n- With tensions high in Hong Kong and it looking increasingly likely that China may take full control of the region, it may be that the PRC will decide to 'kill two birds with one stone' and annex Taiwan as well. Less Likely:\n- Although the base rate stands at 1.5% there has not been any lethal conflict between the two sides since 1958. Since international relations and the stability of the region have improved in the last 50 years it is likely that the true probability or base rate is significantly less than 1.5%.\n- The history of relations between the two sides has ebbed and flowed between peaceful cooperation and guarded aggression since 1960. The heightened hostility of the last year may not necessarily be any worse than when relations have soured and thawed in the past.\n- Any invasion or lethal conflict with Taiwan would undoubtedly further sour Chinese relations with the rest of the world. Since China's prosperity depends on maintaining trade and cooperation with the West it is unlikely that it would do anything that could lead to significant international condemnation. Considering the points above I do think that lethal conflict is more likely at the minute than the base rate would suggest. However, I do not think that it is twice as likely as normal and I am therefore going to say that there is a 2% chance of lethal conflict occurring before 15th December."], [1034, "2020-06-04T04:16:12Z", [0.0], ""], [88283, "2020-06-03T23:28:40Z", [0.01], ""], [86678, "2020-06-03T21:03:02Z", [0.01], ""], [87342, "2020-06-03T19:51:41Z", [0.09], ""], [77516, "2020-06-03T18:10:17Z", [0.05], ""], [53593, "2020-06-03T14:09:11Z", [0.0], ""], [88954, "2020-06-03T12:11:39Z", [0.1], ""], [57778, "2020-06-03T07:12:45Z", [0.07], ""], [86058, "2020-06-03T03:43:09Z", [0.09], "Error in my previous forecast, was intending to write 9, not 49."], [86058, "2020-06-03T03:39:17Z", [0.49], "China have not been in a lethal confrontation in the last 20 years involving territorial disputes, so it would seem unlikely.

The decisive factors appear to me to be: 1) the level of crisis within the United States due to COVID, 2) the level of global hostility directed at China over COVID's outbreak, 3) China's domestic stability. I believe there a reasonable potential with COVID-19 that the US finds itself in additional outbreaks and even deeper economic crises over the remainder of the year, rendering it either unable to totally disinterested in backing Taiwan against anything other than an all out invasion. At the same time global hostility to China could grow drastically to the point that China feels the need to exert some show of force as a subtle/not-so-subtle reminder of its power and that aggression towards the country or the CCP does not come without consequences. The ideal show of force would be explicitly martial, but implicitly economical. It would not be difficult for the Chinese navy to have some sort of \"hostile\" encounter with a Taiwanese vessel that could serve as a pretext for the Chinese Navy to close the strait temporarily. It seems reasonable that a potential hostile encounter that might precipitate such a crisis would involve a fatality.  This would allow the Chinese to flex their military might while also directly reminding the globe that in a world where the US has become internally focused, and either unable to or disinterested in projecting power in places like the Taiwan Strait, that China is the proverbial \"indispensable man\". China's domestic political picture could greatly impact this situation further that it is not entirely clear to me in what manner. I am not sure whether greater domestic upheaval would make the Chinese leadership more likely to attempt power projections in the Taiwan Strait or less likely but my general feeling is more likely. Greater domestic tranquility in China I believe would make any possible violent episode in the strait less likely.

Historically there has been only 1 in the past half-century or so, giving this question a base rate of under 1% over 6 months.\n- China likes to conduct drills and displays to show their might, but they rarely want to provoke anger through a direct military confrontation.
