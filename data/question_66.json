[2,3]  Not sure how likely it is that those two countries will submit info and everyone else be able to consider it in time.  Plus, as others have noted, there are placeholders for future meetings in 2016 already. Not sure I understand resolution criteria adequately - whether agreement needs to be announced or whether it needs to be signed.  Also not sure if it is possible to reach an agreement without the input of some of the countries....I'm thinking no but may be wrong.

I'm much more pessimistic, though. http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/743136/full-steam-ahead-for-rcep-trade-deal\n\"Sixteen members have tentatively agreed to eliminate tariffs on 65% of all goods, amounting to 8,000-9,000 items, under the RCEP plans,,,,,,at the 10th meeting of negotiating teams from Oct 12-16 in Busan, South Korea.......It will be submitted to the Asean Summit next month in Kuala Lumpur....Further talks are needed for... 15% of products which are mostly sensitive items\",  So it looks like there is only a partial agreement at the moment.  A couple of older references provide more details. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership\nAccording to wikipedia, there are three more negotiating rounds scheduled, in February and then April 2016. However, this article doesn't seem to have been updated since June. There's also this article from two months ago\nhttp://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/mega-trade-pact-recp-to-miss-2015-deadline/story/223100.html\n\"..Ministers emphasised that the RCEP Trade Negotiating Committee should expedite the negotiations with a view to substantially concluding the negotiations by the end of 2015 with the remaining technical issues to be resolved as soon as possible in 2016.\"  Thus, unless conclusion of TTP negotiations has injected more urgency into the RCEP process, it doesn't look like it'll be done by 01 Jan 2016. Certainly China and India will be pushing for it as they are not in the TPP but there's not much time to agree on the remaining 15% of goods, mostly \"sensitive items\".
