Look at the history of the Egyptian economy since 1966. It is not a roller coaster, but has high variability. Sure most forecasts say 3%, but random stuff can hike it up. My forecast is not great, I base it on basically nothing, but it is certainly higher than 1%, so I am going to improve my score compared to the average guesser of today. The question we should ask ourselves is \"how often does a genuinely crappy economy with terrible governance increace by more than 5%, after a few years of poor growth\". Certainly more often than 0% of years. Another thing that might hike it up is fraud.
