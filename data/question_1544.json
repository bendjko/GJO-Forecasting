And today  COVID-19 is a scary beast that forces social distancing, closing schools, travel bans and economy downturn. According to WHO and CDC (and in our minds), the whole world is on fire, even countries like China and South Korea, which apparently got it under control (though may lose it). IOC insistence on Olympic Games seems irresponsible and careless Fast forward 4 months. Imagine - everywhere there was an economic downturn. Restaurants have been closed, sport events cancelled. Unemployment soared, markets crashed. Doom and gloom. But a lot of countries (even Italy), with extreme measures, seemingly took the epidemics under control. Yes, there were (tens) thousands of deaths, the health systems overwhelmed... People made sacrifices and it became \"better\". People discovered that while it is scary on TV and internet, most people didn't get infected, but suffered economically, emotionally nevertheless. Yes, it came to full force to the Southern Hemisphere (with winter there) and now is worsening in Africa and Latin America. But there (some, most promising, which means money for support) athletes adapted, moved to train to Northern Hemisphere, to Japan, South Korea, China (with acclimatization in time as a bonus). People want a relief from all this. And IOC makes a decision - to go ahead with the Olympics (with potential no public on stadiums). Yes, some athletes may miss it. But it looks fair as the most trained for this all previous years and any disruption/postponing looks Unfair to them. What looked as reckless in March now, in July, seems to be bold, inspiring. To hold the Games against all odds. In their future decision not to postpone, IOC cited \u2026 history of the Spanish flu: they reminded that it was the SECOND wave of Spanish flu that killed most people.  The Spanish flu most probably started in late 1917, maybe also in China (the Chinese dispute that). It led to some deaths and spread to North America and Europe. Then it almost disappeared after the season. But it came back in late 1918 (possibly in mutated form) and became a devastating pandemic. So postponed Games can be held under even worse conditions.

It seems to me extremely unlikely that either of them will take place as planned but not the other. In modern times there have been 31 planned Summer Olympics, of which 3 (9.7%) were cancelled due to war. Including Winter Olympics gives us similar numbers, so the base rate for a Yes answer is roughly 10%. But these are already exceptional times. Sporting events (including the Tokyo Marathon) are being postponed, cancelled, or otherwise modified throughout the world. In Japan, currently, the health system is almost unable to cope (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-challenges-idUSKBN2130JR)\u2014and there are unproven concerns that Japan has been intentionally undercounting its cases. Countries around the world are restricting travel and quarantining their citizens. And at the time of writing (16 March) the world is wholly within the exponential growth phase of coronavirus spread, and it's a safe bet to say that we will see tighter and harsher restrictions in a matter of days worldwide. Doctors\u2014in Italy and increasingly elsewhere\u2014are speaking about having to resort to wartime triage decisions. So an alternative framing: what if we see the current circumstances _as if_ we were at war, or about to head into it? Perhaps overly dramatic (death counts much, much lower, and the sacrifices we have been asked to make are extremely modest by comparison) but such a framing helps us give less credence to the outside view. Think for example of the scenario where three or four major players\u2014the US, Italy, France, Germany\u2014declare they will not participate in the Olympics as planned. The pressure to postpone would be hard to resist. Or think of the planning and coordination that such a major event requires been done under self-isolation policies. Or of the qualifying trials that would need to happen worldwide, soon, when major sporting leagues are cancelling even practice sessions. It's not impossible to conceive, but it does seem quite unlikely to me. As a first stab, I'll base my forecast on two possibilities that I'll assume are independent. The Olympics will be cancelled, postponed, or relocated, if:\n* that international pressure leads to it (65%), or...\n* that internal pressure within Japan, either from the health system, public opinion, or from logistical challenges in the face of the pandemic, does (55%) Which leads to a likelihood of _going ahead as planned_ of 16%.

The Paralympics come later in the summer so the temperatures should still be good, and while the athletes are typically young and fit as well, there is more potential that some would suffer more from symptoms based on their underlying physical conditions. If that is widespread, a lack of athletes may disrupt the games, however, the withdrawal of up to 10% of the athletes would likely not cause the games to be canceled. Equally, a postponement would only shift the games into the cooler months, when the infections rates are expected to uptick again, therefore the only reasonable timeframe would be the summer of 2021, but the circumstances would likely be similar to now.

Consider that NBC can't afford to move the games a year and be forced to refund marketing dollars.  Thus, at best they could postpone a few weeks.  Any more than a few weeks and it runs into the NFL.  However, I don't think they will view a few weeks as mattering if the pandemic has already lasted several months.  Thus, what would be gained by postponing?  Nothing. 2) Relocate:  Now this is much trickier as this is overly vague.  I wonder how \"specific\" they mean with \"relocate.\"  Certain events may end up being shifted to alternate locations (this happens at the Olympics on a regular basis).  Roughly 5% of Olympics go off without any events being moved by my quick wikipedia calcs.  Is GJO going to make sure that each of the events was indeed hosted at the specific sites originally planned?  If they aren't going to count this, then at what point does it truly become \"relocating\" 10% of events? 20% 50%?   It's highly probable that Tokyo does not host all of the events (they already have some dozen events at hosted outside the vicinity anyhow)  I would flip my entire answer if it the allowance was provided that \"relocate\" means changing event venues.  If relocation only means changing the host city, then it really isn't practical. I don't see any of these options truly helping the situation. The only \"real\" solution which does not fall under any of the specified restrictions: \n -> Televised Events Only:  This solution solves all of the problems and places all of the financial burden on 3rd parties (airlines/hotels). Lastly, anyone that has done any of the viral outbreak forecasts knows that there is a massive spread and then decline.  Based on the pace of transmission reported by WHO  (though honestly is probably un-reliable), my AI program resulted in a declining estimate of cases by Mid-May.  This was considerably later than what was predicted by the University of Texas: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.07112.pdf"], [18322, "2020-03-04T05:48:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.92], ""], [84606, "2020-03-04T01:39:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2876095-ioc-tokyo-2020-olympics-wont-be-cancelled-or-postponed-due-to-coronavirus I believe that there is a very low chance that the Olympics will be cancelled or postponed. This Bleacher Report article contains a statement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that they have no intent under any foreseeable circumstances to cancel, move, or postpone the Olympic Games. The coronavirus simply just isn't as big of a health scare as initially thought, with only a 2% mortality rate with almost every death reported being from either extremely young or old people or people with poor immune systems due to other medical issues. The media has blown the virus out of proportion and caused panic around the world, which is spreading quicker than the virus itself. The IOC can see through all this and knows that the virus isn't as much of a threat as so many are making it out to be. Additionally, the Olympics still have over four months before its Opening Ceremonies, which should be plenty of time for the virus to blow over as most cases only last around a week. There is still the off chance that extra precautions are taken and the Games are postponed or cancelled (moving them would prove to be extremely difficult due to the immense amount of planning that is put into the Olympics by the host country, and furthermore the virus is now a worldwide pandemic not exclusive to Japan) due to public pressure, but unless this occurs the Olympic Games should continue on as scheduled."], [80235, "2020-03-04T01:16:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [85874, "2020-03-04T01:14:48Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [84336, "2020-03-04T00:24:20Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.38, 0.6], ""], [85774, "2020-03-03T23:42:17Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [38, "2020-03-03T22:38:58Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.05, 0.85], "I am finding it hard to not get caught up in the panic that seems to be spreading faster than this virus.\nI found this article very encouraging & hopeful.

A recent statement by the Japanese Olympic Minister[1] has forced me to revaluate this stance.  In order to arrive at a new forecast I will take the average of the three scenarios: Not cancelled, postponed, and both cancelled (I have taken the stance that the postponement or cancellation of one but not the other should not currently be considered).  Refer to previous forecast (linked below) for discussion of factors, which I do not believe this examination will affect (at least at present time) Availability of Venues later in 2020\n\u2022\tCertainly seems to be the most obvious factor and if a list of olympic venues [2] is viewed it shows that there is a good mix of existing and under construction venues; existing would suggest that they have current tenants or event schedules and under construction could mean that postponing any anticipated tenants might be possible (or not depending on what is going to happen). \n\u2022\tOne example perhaps not being able to delay return to non-Olympic life: Ajinomoto Stadium which is the home of Tokyo FC, which presumably would need to take back possession.  That being said the season starts in March so perhaps no one is using it.  It is currently difficult to track down the pre-and post-Olympic planned uses of venues\n\u2022\tOne example of being able to delay post-Olympic life: Tokyo Tatsumi International Swimming Center: presumably outside of local swim clubs and regional competitions this wouldn\u2019t have any marquee tenants\n\u2022\tMarathons which utilize public roads lie somewhere in the middle of perhaps being possible and perhaps not being possible to postpone\t Availability of athlete accommodations and Athlete/Olympic Village\n\u2022\tOlympic Village: located right beside the Athlete Village (both of which are located on pier which have been razed) does not seem to have any future tenant because all wood used to construct it will be taken down and recycled or returned to municipalities which donated the wood originally[3].  These pieces are to be used as more commemorative pieces \u2013 so no sense that they cannot wait\n\u2022\tAthlete\u2019s Village: Condos and rental units are planned of the 10,000 stand alone living spaces however, they are not planned to be made available until March 2023 [4].  Similarly to the Vancouver Winter Olympics, it stands to reason that extensive remodel or completion will be required.  As such, this seems akin to any construction delay\n\u2022\tCan the athletes even be housed?  It seems the answer to this is yes.  I have assumed that no team of athletes/trainers/delegates will mind any postponement because they train 4 years for this Average weather by month and anticipated virus peak\n\u2022\tFrankly this seems to be a more important factor than the two preceding because not only are the Games limited by weather (it is the summer Olympics after all). But this should be considered in conjunction with the Virus and its anticipated spread\n\u2022\tBased on historical weather averages, it seems that the Games can realistically only be delayed until October (and perhaps early October at that) given the steep drop in temperature beginning in November [5] so the question becomes, will the virus be contained by that point or early enough to schedule a postponement in its logistical entirety \n\u2022\tSome public health estimates are working on the basis that infections would peak three months after first sustained community transmission [6] as astutely pointed out by @pstamp [7]\n\u2022\tA three peak, could push the timeframe a bit too close to the October hard-stop for anyones comfort and making cancellation versus postponement more likely Final thoughts re postponement: \n\u2022\tThis may be perhaps a stereotype, but if there is one nation that seems to understand sacrifice to achievement of societal level goals it is Japan; so it seems possible that anything that needs to be made available could be made available\n\u2022\tI have assumed that no team of athletes/trainers/delegates will mind any postponement because they train 4 years for this\n\u2022\tPublic Health Insider\u2019s, seem to think postponement is most likely [8] but I\u2019m not so sure based on the factors listed above.  Logistically it may be possible, but the runway to postpone is not that long.  I think that the Japanese Olympic Decision Makers think it\u2019s a viable option, but I don\u2019t think that the IOC does. Keep in mind they would take input from WHO, although their statement position is that the games will continue as planned.  A public spat between the two probably wouldn\u2019t go well for the local committee\n\u2022\tThings I have not considered in great depth because I am unable to qualify in detail: broadcasting schedules.  A push to late September or early august coincides with a number of other sports and contracts to run them; that being said, would broadcasters have to pay fees in accordance with long since signed agreements and would they prefer less money from postponed games versus no ad revenue from cancelled games?  I would assume cancelled games relieves them of their financial obligations whereas postponed games do not Note: in regard to relocation, I don\u2019t think I adequately have addressed this yet.  I do not believe that any other venue that would be acceptable to the IOC and the various Individual Nation Olympic Committees would be suitable for relocation.

However, a vaccine had already been produced and administered prior to the Vancouver Olympics and the Zika virus is not transmitted from human to human but via mosquitos. Therefore, qualitatively Covid-19 is different.  This is a black swan event and therefore I am not sure the historical base rate provides much use in calculating a forecast in this instance. I am going to assume that measures can be put in place to protect a relatively small number of athletes (compared to the population at large) e.g. requiring them to arrive 2 weeks in advance and self-isolating, transporting them directly to/from venues to Olympic venues.  The primary consideration therefore is crowds. For this, we need to look primarily at the number of cases in Japan. International visitors may stay away but I do not think this would cause the authorities to cancel the games considering it is so late in the day and that the games are broadcast globally (which wasn't the case in the previous instances where the games have been cancelled). We therefore need to monitor internal cases of Covid-19 in Japan and the authorities response over the next few months. This forecast will need adjusting accordingly as the circumstances are very fluid.  Additional note: there is a 2 week gap between the Olympics and Paralympics.

Sounds like the decision would need to be some time in the next month or two. Given that's a political decision that involves many countries and a large multi-national non-profit I would assume the strong preference will be to kick the can down the road and make a decision later ... which means deciding to go ahead with the games. The US administration seems to be in \"everything is perfectly normal\" mode right now.  So I think they'll strongly prefer a plan based on mitigating risks rather than cancelling, even if the crisis gets substantially worse over the next 30 days. If it does get much worse very fast, then the most obvious risk mitigation strategy is to have fewer or no spectators. At that point I think it comes down to economics. (see: https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/economics-hosting-olympic-games)  For the IOC it's obvious: over 90% of their revenue comes from TV and sponsorship rights which all evaporates if the games are cancelled. For Japan the host country it's cost (mostly infrastructure and security) vs income (mostly general tourism, sponsorship, TV rights and long-term value of the infrastructure and just ~10% from ticket sales). Given that the infrastructure expense is mostly already spent and tourism is likely to suck regardless, so I think economics will push them to go ahead.  If all that's true, how do we come up with a quantitative estimate? First I don't see a scenario in which just the Olympics are canceled without the Special Olympics or visa versa. I'll call those both <5%. For the other buckets I just don't know. I guess by looking at base rates for similar events. Problem: there isn't enough data for Olympics. Maybe include major world championships like swimming, track and soccer/football. The base rate for all of these is virtually zero cancellation even in the face of Zika, wars and terrorist threats. I think COVID will turn out to be on the big side of that spectrum so I'll call it 90-95% chance that they go forward. I would not be surprised to see specific countries decide not to attend or perhaps get un-invited if they have a lot of current cases.  Some other observations: \n1) Japan appears to be successful in managing their own outbreak and I assume that will continue through the spring\n2) tentative consensus seems to be that even if the outbreak gets much worse, coronavirus cases are still likely to drop off as northern hemisphere weather warms so hopefully the trend will be strongly down by the time May and June get here"], [42563, "2020-03-01T22:37:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [2497, "2020-03-01T22:36:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [84533, "2020-03-01T21:52:31Z", [0.02, 0.02, 0.92, 0.04], "Feb 28, 2020 \"FIFA president Gianni Infantino has refused to rule out the possibility of international matches being postponed if the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread.\"  The virus is continuing to spread and Japan has no national organization like the CDC to help protect Japanese citizens.

So, I assume that Japan will be loathe to cancel them entirely.  I assume that even unsuccessful games would mean less of a financial loss than no games at all.    There's cases of COVID-19 in just about every country in Europe now, and there's some evidence that it may be environmentally transmittable.  Athletes from the nations of Europe compose a significant percentage of the participants in the Olympics.  Rather than cancel the games entirely,  Japan might ban athletes from nations were COVID-19 is raging un-contained. Even if many countries decline to participate or are banned, I think that the games will be held anyway to recoup the investment.   0% for cancellation of both. Might they cancel one event and not the other?  Why would they do that?  They need to hold the Olympics to recoup expenses.  They might as well hold the Paralympics because the die will have been cast by the time the Olympics are over.  0% for cancellation of one or the other. re: re-location\nTo where?  It takes years and years of preparation to build facilities/venues to host these games.  Any city which has recently hosted has their facilities already booked for other events by now.  Besides, the only place without COVID-19 is Antarctica, and by then, it'll probably have had a case, too!  0% for re-location for both Might they re-locate one and not the other?  Why?  What benefit would that be?  0% for re-location of one or the other. re:  postponement\nBecause the Olympic & Paralympic games are linked both in nature and in time,  I was about to say that any decision would impact both of them, when it occurred to me that the decision might be to postpone the Olympic games until after the Paralympic games:  ie. flip-flop their order.  Doing this would buy the Olympic committee a little time to prepare for quarantining, training medical staff, etc before the \"main event\".  So, I see postponing as a possibility. Which would they postpone?  Would they postpone both?  Because of the seasonality of flus, if they postpone by much, the date will be on the cusp of the next flu season.  However, by then there might be a vaccine. . . throwing darts, I'm saying 20% postpone the Olympics (until after the Paralympics)  and 5% postpone both in hopes of a vaccine being available. Base rate:\nFor a while there was a lot of fear surrounding zika prior to the Olympics in Brazil and much discussion of cancellation--in part because there was also grave concern about the ability of Brazil to have all the construction of the venues completed.  Over time, as the origin, mode of transmission, rate of infection, etc for zika became better known and pre-cautionary and preventative steps were identified, fears subsided and the games were not cancelled.  I assume that the same will be true with this, however, at this point, COVID-19 seems to be far easier to get than zika, and far harder to take precautions against.  It's not like putting on bug-dope and wearing tightly woven clothes will prevent one from getting COVID-19! \"Before 24 July . . . \"\nI don't see a decision to cancel, re-locate or postpone either/both of these events delayed until the day the Olympics are scheduled to start because these events are too complex and large so they require long lead times.   So, I don't see this question resolving as \"Yes\" at the last minute.  In other words, I don't think that the closing date of this question is going to cause it to close \"pre-maturely\".

The virus may have slowed down somewhat in China, but it still has most of the world's population to infect. Most of the world is still waiting for the real outbreak to begin.

Even if it's mostly subsided by then, there will still be a significant chance that it will come back (cf. the \"deadly second wave\" of the Spanish flu). Given that risk, even if Japan and the IOC want to go ahead with it, many countries may choose not to participate, which would force Japan and the IOC to cancel anyway. There is also the disruption to training. Training in many events involves the gathering of many people: teammates, training partners, coaches, trainers, etc. With traveling substantially reduced and mass gatherings discouraged or prohibited, regular training sessions will be difficult to carry out. Even if they are logistically possible, some participants may decide to postpone training, for fear of getting sick. This is not to mention that many participants actually will get infected.
