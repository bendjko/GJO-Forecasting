Results / calculations follow. Summary of my approach: \n1) I pulled down the viewership information from the past 2 seasons here: \nhttp://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nfl-tv-ratings-viewership-nbc-cbs-fox-espn-nfln-regular-season-playoffs/ 2) Straight Averaging SNF gives you a result of: 16.5M 3) However, this ignores the teams that played, as such I conducted a team-by-team assessment of viewership. DAL / PIT / GB had the most consistent high-viewership (21.9M / 20.6M / 20.2M, respectively) A number of teams had really low viewership and few data-points (LA, CLE, TEN) all with less than 7 Million. So what about the two playing Sunday? \nNE: 19.2M (High) \nDEN: 18.3M (High)   This puts my Base guess of viewership as: 16.9 = [Avg (19.2, 18.3) + SNF Premium (1.8) + Annual Adjust (-1.6)] * Futon to SMW Ratio (.89%) Words of caution: \n1) Standard Deviation of the errors recently is about 7.5% of the estimate (1.3M in this case). \n2) Denver appears to have an upward results bias due to the selection of their opponents.  It's highly probable that the basic model is giving double credit as a result of them frequently being televised playing against high quality teams rather than as an independent observation.\n3) Downward Trend:  Obviously there is a significant downward trend in viewership.  I've started to account for this in my annual adjustment (now up to a 1.6 reduction for 2017).  However, this has been growing rather than shrinking.  Trend lining the miss would suggest a reduction of 1.8 is necessary for this week.  I hope this helps. ------------ Update 11/13/2017 ------------- Results are in:  15.3 Million Viewers. \nI should have adjusted lower based on my words of caution.  The problem is I don't know which of them is actually the cause of the model's miss."], [41270, "2017-11-10T19:43:58Z", [0.76, 0.17, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [23542, "2017-11-10T19:41:43Z", [0.03, 0.06, 0.66, 0.22, 0.03], ""], [12879, "2017-11-10T18:58:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], ""], [33887, "2017-11-10T18:46:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34353, "2017-11-10T18:27:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.43, 0.47], "Going spread on the higher end here initially. New England typically draws large viewership amounts. This, in years past, would have been a great match-up, but with Denver not playing well this year, I think it might tamp down some viewership. The last game NE played on SNF (Oct 22, 2017), they drew 16.7M viewers, so I think it's likely to be somewhere above 15.5M. And with no real competitive programming, I think SNF will lead the networks for viewership."]], "open_date": "2017-11-10T18:00:41Z", "close_date": "2017-11-13T07:59:14Z"}
