Tikhanovskaya was unsuccessful in her campaign for president, however, many do not believe the results that were announced;\n \u201cthe country\u2019s president, Alexksandr G. Lukashenko, claimed a landslide victory in a ballot that was widely denounced as fraudulent. Mr. Lukashenko, who has clung to power amid violent protests denouncing the election, had faced a surprising challenge from Ms. Tikhanovskaya, who became his fiercest rival\u201d (Specia, 2020). \nAfter the election, Tikhanovskaya fled the country of Belarus which is widely speculated to be under the orders of the current government; \u201cMs. Tikhanovskaya, 37, on Sunday fled the country for Lithuania under what her associates said were pressure from the Belarusian authorities\u201d (Specia, 2020). This is a claim that Ms. Tikhanovskaya make out publically and denounce, \u201c\u2018I made this decision absolutely independently,\u2019 Ms. Tikhanovskaya said in another cryptic video message on Tuesday\u201d (Nechepurenk and Troianovski, 2020). The election has caused major uproars throughout the nation, sparking violent protests.  Even though Ms. Tikhanovskaya claims she left on her own accord, it simply does not seem to be the case as she was also quoted urging Belarusians to accept the results of the election and \u201cnot to put your lives at risk\u201d \u201d (Nechepurenk and Troianovski, 2020). While things are still unfolding, this does not seem like a situation that will be resolved anytime soon. As of now, I believe the most likely scenario to be Ms. Tikhanovskaya will not return before October 17, 2020, which I put at 70%, followed by 28% probability of her returning between September 4 and October 16, 2020. That leaves only two percent chance for her to return before September 4th. While nothing is impossible, I find it highly unlikely seeing how volatile the situation is. \nUpdate: Late September/Early October: Former presidential candidate has continued to put pressure on President Lukashenko, \u201cthe Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya will meet Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday, as the standoff in Belarus increasingly takes on a geopolitical dimension, becoming one more bone of contention between Russia and the west\u201d (Walker, 2020). Protests continue to happen throughout the country and Tikhanovskaya has motivated protestors by declaring herself the winner of the previous election, \u201cTikhanovskaya, who officially received only 10% of the vote in the election, has declared herself national leader, and wants to be a transitional figure until new, free elections can be held\u201d (Walker, 2020). There is some speculation that Tikhanovskaya will return to Belarus, \u201cOlga Kovalkova, authorized representative of former Belarusian presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, believes that the politician will soon return home\u201d (Tass, 2020). President Lukashenko also spoke on the matter in a very blunt and telling manner, \u201cincumbent Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said he won\u2019t allow to \u2018give away\u2019 his country even if he dies\u201d (Tass, 2020). Both Tikhanovskaya and Lukashenko claim to be the rightful President of Belarus. However, as previously stated Tikhanovskaya left just after the election and has yet to return. Lukashenko has made it very clear he will not give up his position under any circumstance. With all of this in mind, it is my opinion that Tikhanovskaya will not return to Belarus before October 17, 2020, and I would consider that at 99% probability. The final 1% would be returning between September 4 and October 16, 2020, but once again, this is very doubtful. \nSpecia, M. (2020, August 13).

Svetlana Tikhanovskaya who fled hours after election results were released has recently traveled throughout Europe imploring for the EU to increase pressure on Lukashenko to step down, including speaking with Germany\u2019s Prime Minister Merkel (Browne, 2020; Walker, 2020). While some countries including Great Britain have increased pressure by removing their ambassadors (RFE, 2020), more pressure is likely required collectively from the EU before her return as Vladimir Putin backed Lukashenko with a 1.5 Billion loan and offers of contributing police forces to combat protestors (Kudrytski & Kravchenko, 2020). Additionally, as of 7 October, Russia placed Tikhanovskaya on a wanted list for her role in Belarus (BBC, 2020).

It is clear that she has the support of the people and it seems like she is the person that Belarus needs in this moment, and I believe she is going to do whatever it takes to return and take power.

Tikhanovskaya has met with French President Emanuel Macron to seek his assistance in mediating the dispute, potentially with Russia\u2019s participation.  Tikhanovskaya previously met with leaders in Poland and Lithuania as well (France24, 2020).  This demonstrates some desire to return to her homeland.  However, Russia\u2019s backing of Lukashenko and their unscrupulous treatment of opposition politicians like Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned and nearly died, make any potential return by Tikhanovskaya potentially deadly.  The meetings conducted by Tikhanovskaya in other countries, though, make it clear she intends to return at some point.  If President Lukashenko is forced out of office, that would likely speed her return. Unfortunately, President Lukashenko is not likely to leave office any time soon.  President Putin has backed other world leaders who were under more turmoil than Lukashenko is now; Russia has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, both of whom have faced more significant opposition, and both of whom remain in office.  Putin has shown he is more than willing to support embattled heads of state to whom he is allied, and his support may have saved the current regimes in both Syria and Venezuela. It is also worth mentioning that the European Union is not following up with serious measures on Belarus.  The EU sanctioned forty Belarusian officials for their conduct in the recent election, but Lukashenko\u2019s name was conspicuously absent from this list. (Rankin, 2020).  While he could still face sanctions in the future, it\u2019s worth noting that sanctions from other countries and governmental bodies did not lead to regime change in Syria or Venezuela.  Outside of a country or international body committing military forces to get rid of Lukashenko, a move which would not make it past the UN Security Council on which Russia has a seat, Lukashenko is likely safe to serve his term in office.  Meanwhile, Belarusian protests against Lukashenko continue apace, and while they are inspired by Tikhanovskaya, her physical presence is clearly not required. On this website, this question is phrased to allow three possible answers: Before September 4, 2020 (which did not happen), Between 4 September and 16 October (which has two weeks left), and after 17 October.  It is safe to say that if Tikhanovskaya returns at all, it will likely be after 17 October, which I rate at <99%.  Her return within the next two weeks is rated at >1%. Tikhanovskaya has a lot of political measures to try outside her home country before returning would be necessary to effect change. Works Cited: Good Judgment Open (2020).

Some commentators suggest the purpose of the meeting was to calm the long running protestors or possibly even persuade them that change is a foot. Even if change in the election result and / or constitution is likely, it is not likely to be within the time frame of this question. Updated 20200106 Now it is extremely unlikely that Tikhanovskaya can, or will be able to, return to Belarus in the next 10 days. See https://bbc.in/34BS3Iv Certainly not while Lukashenko is being supported by Russia and still holding some authority. Updated 20200929 Sanctions against Lukashenko and his close allies announced by UK & Canada ( See https://reut.rs/3cEYNt3 & https://reut.rs/3cJcIxW) are unlikely to create sufficient pressure on Lukashenko to resign before on on 17 Oct  in my view and thus enable Tikhanovskaya to return to Belarus before 17 Oct 2020. Further to my forecast below of 20200921 & 20200923, Lukaschenko's apparently surprise swearing in and appointment to the office of President yesterday (https://reut.rs/3kzHdcC) in some respects further entrenches his position of 'authority' albeit Germany has reaffirmed it does recognise Lukaschenko's position (https://reut.rs/2G4rxPq). This event reduces further the likelihood to Tikhanovskaya's return in the next 24 days. Sanctions for 6-8 individuals may be forthcoming from USA, UK, & Canada in the next few days - https://reut.rs/2Hu5Jh3. However, this is unlikely to change Lukaschenko's attitude. Equally, as we know, (https://bit.ly/36bp4h4 & https://reut.rs/3mWTY35) on 14 Sept, Russia's Putin provided Lukaschenko with a US$1.5bn lifeline. What was discussed in private between the two meeting in Socchi and at other times in the last few weeks, we do not know. The withdrawal of Russian border forces a few weeks ago was apparently replaced by joint military exercises and the parachuting of commandos into Belarus territory within the last week (https://bit.ly/2EAqYg8 & https://reut.rs/2RXOkz8).

Of these 19 elections, 9 were direct presidential elections (the rest were parliamentary elections). Of these 19 elections, only 4 elections were overruled later. All of these 4 elections were overruled quite rapidly. The elections in Belarus took place on August 9 and it is still holding up, making it more and more likely every day that it will also stay. Furthermore, the current Belarusian leader Lukashenko was already being accused of fraudulent elections in 2006 and 2015. All of these indicate that even though there was some turmoil and upheaval regarding the election, it is not so likely for an election to be overthrown. Given the current situation, Tikhanovskaya's return is closely tied to the election results and Lukashenko's loss of power. As @walkertheos pointed out correctly, political exiles tend to be long dated in nature and people often overestimate the magnitude of these upheavals. This is very nicely shown in Google Trends \"Belarusian election\" and \"Lukashenko\" where the searches spiked right after the election, however they have quickly returned back to the levels prior election. This might also indicate that the majority of Belarusian population will not initiate a long and overwhelming protest. Moreover, Lukashenko was also talking to the Russian government about their help in the situation. Even though Russia has not expressed its view on the matter publicly, they might also help the government if necessary.

Tikhanovskaya fled Belarus last month after accusing the current President Alexander Lukashenko for rigging the election. While news outlets initially cited that Tikhanovskaya left as part of a deal to get her campaign manager, she subsequently released a video cited safety concerns for children as a main reason. Shortly after the accusations against Lukashenko, riots broke out in Belarus, an they continue to this day.\nAll of this is to say that the factors that initially caused Tikhanovskaya to flee the country are likely still in full effect, as President Lukashenko is desperate to silence the protests against him.

I do not have much quantitative metrics to go against so I will assign and 85% probability that she will not return by October 16th.

Will update further as more information releases. "], [95347, "2020-09-04T02:04:57Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.94], "I know next to nothing about this question, so my default position is one of uncertainty. However, the probability of Tikhanovskaya returning tomorrow is approximately 0. My understanding is that Tikhanovskaya is in a kind of pseudo-exile, despite potentially having popular support. And in general, political exiles have a long time horizon (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_or_government_who_have_been_in_exile). Furthermore, I think it is reasonable to assume that Tikhanovskaya's probability of mounting a successful return is proportional to the amount of unrest in Belarus (because this diminishes Lukashenko's control), and that the amount of unrest decays with time. Put more simply, the longer TIkhanovskaya takes to return, the more additional time we should expect her return to take. There is also confusion surrounding a video released by the government that supposedly shows Tikhanovskaya calling for an end to protests (source: https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/europe/belarus-opposition-leader-flees-intl/index.html). There was speculation that she was threatened to make this video and then leave the country. Regardless of the veracity of these claims, it is certainly a possibility that the Belarusian government holds some kind of leverage over Tikhanovskaya, which is yet another factor complicating the prospect of her return. While I don't have a rigorous mathematical framework for this question, weighing all of the above led me to decide on a 94% probability that Tikhanovskaya will not return to Belarus before October 17. This reflects my high confidence that it will take at least that long, but also uncertainty because I know so little about this subject."], [92863, "2020-09-03T20:43:54Z", [0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [67403, "2020-09-03T20:34:20Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [95426, "2020-09-03T18:12:38Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [8826, "2020-09-03T17:56:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "she would be crazy if she did"], [95340, "2020-09-03T16:35:40Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.98], "https://tass.com/world/1190857\nThis news was from a month ago.

Ms Tikhanovskaya won\u2019t come back in this case (99% conditional proba here) as she fears for her security and that wont change: the violence and abuse used by authorities against protesters is not going away anytime soon [2].

Since moving to Lithuania, Ms Tikhanovskaya has called on Belarusians to continue to demonstrate peacefully against Mr Lukashenko and that has worked so far.

Next, we know that ST has repeatedly said that she will return to Belarus \"when I feel safe there\" (Source: https://www.dw.com/en/belarus-tsikhanouskaya-strikes/a-54645404). As a brief note, she fled to Lithuania on August 11. It is important to note that  even when news broke about the current President Alexander Lukashenko (AL) may flee to Russia in August for safety she did not return. Therefore, let us break down our first calculation as follows by law of total probability: P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16) = P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16 | Safe to return) P(Safe to return) + P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16 | Not safe) P(Not safe) Clearly, defining safe and not safe is not abundantly obvious, but from my googling around, there seems to be 3 main ways it could be safe: (1) AL flees the country between 9/4 - 10/16 (2) AL steps down peacefully (3) Beneficial foreign intervention for ST (obviously Russia invading would not be good for ST's chances). (2) and (3) I put at a total of 0.09 probability. AL leaving is also reasonable but given he's remained in Belarus since the start of the protests and has had multiple chances to leave the country, I put this probability at 0.05 -> P(Safe to return) = 0.14. P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16 | Safe to return) is clearly high and I put it at say 0.9, slightly lowering than what I would like since it is not clear that she would be able to immediately return. For P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16 | Not safe) I put at quite low, given ST's previous actions when AL was rumored to leave the country, say 0.02. This gives us P(ST returns between 9/4 - 10/16)  = 0.1432.

I'm assuming that a \"return to Belarus\" means that she moved back and in residence/living there. At a 22 August press conference, she said she would go back to Belarus as soon as: A) she feels safe in Belarus; B) the government signals it is ready to speak; and C) once all political prisoners are freed. (SOURCE: https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/08/25/its-a-long-way-to-tipperary-for-belarus-opposition-leader-svetlana-tikhanovskaya-a71240) A) Her husband, Sergey, and the original opposition candidate remains in Lukashenko's custody. Herself and her children (whom Lukashenko has previously threatened, necessitating the earlier exile of the children) remain in exile in Vilnius, Lithuania. Due to the fact that almost all of the opposition leaders are jailed, her movement cannot afford her arrest/detainment. Moreover, she has few reasons she'll receive respectable treatment while detained. I don't know a lot about her, but the fact she may have direct or indirect health issue resulting from her radiation exposure as a child (she's one of the \"Chernobyl children\") may mean she would suffer medically while detained by Lukashenko. After an hour or so OSINT research, I haven't found indication Lukashenko is even remotely considering releasing ALL political prisoners, which Svetlana Tikhanovskaya herself cited as an immutable condition of her return to Belarus, nor any indication he wouldn't immediately seek to imprison her and her children, using them and her husband as leverage for capitulation. However, there are many unknown variables that may alter that decision matrix, leading to her returning to Belarus sooner than expected if she makes a deal not discussed openly or in the press.  B) Currently, Lukashenko is condemned by the EU and will be facing sanctions, along with his most prominent supporters/allies, which may ply him/them enough to come to the table for negotiations, meeting the second criteria set forth by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. However, since Lukashenko enjoys support - if not just official recognition - from Russia and China, then he may \"cut his losses\" with any EU-led punishment or sanction, because he and his allies could offset the impact by increased business with Russia and China - to potentially include unethical/illicit dealings. Success at getting Lukashenko to negotiate in good faith largely depends on the Belarusian Opposition's ability to not only maintain international pressure on Lukashenko, but to also get the US to act with more decisiveness against Lukashenko and his activities by officially refusing to acknowledge the election results and demanding international mediation between the Belarus government and opposition. Trump has, typically, called the chaos \"terrible\" and \"will look into it,\" but such milquetoast is meaningless in this type of situation. Bottom line is until the US takes a serious hand in helping the Belarusian opposition, it's unlikely Lukashenko will feel enough pressure to compromise. Syria anyone?

Until Lukashenko feels enough internal pressure (e.g. severe enough protests or his own government/allies withdraw support) and/or external pressure (e.g. international condemnation and sanctions sufficient to overcome their alternative income sources) their is insufficient reason to believe the second of Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's conditions will be met and he'll free ALL political prisoners. Moreover, his recent display of flying over Minsk in riot gear and with an automatic rifle should explicitly signal where his head is at right now. An intervening variable in this would be the unknown effectiveness of the current protests, and how reflective they are of Belarus as a whole. Lukashenko has some definite relevance problems and is counterproductive to progressivism, but how much of Belarus is that? Bottom line, protests may reflect wider and deeper divisions in society and Lukashenko's leadership, or they can merely reflect a fringe/marginal index of Belarusian society?

Also, and this is subjective of course, I get a sort of vibe from her pictures that she is a survivor, not going to put herself in harms way unless there is a very big upside. I am comparing with Juan Guaido, who seems like more of an idealist, willing to die gloriously, and by contrast DID return to Venezuela (And a fat lot of good that's done so far, so maybe she looks at that and thinks, why bother). So she would probably return if there was a decent path to winning or having an impact, but...I don't think there is. I think Lukashenko just wrecks things for a while, and then loses control.
