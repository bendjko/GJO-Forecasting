Hillary Clinton has not been to the state since Labor Day, and her aides said Thursday that she would not be back until next week, after a monthlong absence, effectively acknowledging how difficult they think it will be to defeat Donald J. Trump here... But its Rust Belt profile, Mr. Trump\u2019s unyielding anti-trade campaign and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s difficulty energizing Ohio\u2019s young voters have made it a lesser focus for Democrats this year, even as it remains critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s path to the White House... And with a once-competitive Senate race in Ohio turning into a rout for Rob Portman, the Republican incumbent, Democrats can quietly pull back from the state with little fear of down-ballot consequences... http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/us/politics/ohio-campaign-trump-clinton.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=2"], [29353, "2016-09-30T10:29:39Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [10267, "2016-09-30T03:42:28Z", [0.7, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [10898, "2016-09-30T02:46:09Z", [0.56, 0.0, 0.44], ""], [38, "2016-09-30T01:09:13Z", [0.56, 0.0, 0.44], ""], [241, "2016-09-29T22:07:15Z", [0.42, 0.0, 0.58], ""], [368, "2016-09-29T19:34:35Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25], ""], [691, "2016-09-29T19:03:09Z", [0.36, 0.0, 0.64], ""], [22243, "2016-09-29T17:32:03Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4], ""], [55, "2016-09-29T17:18:30Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.55], "Polls have been volatile and vote looks close.

Polls are about a popularity contest in the summer of 2016.  The election is about a marketing campaign that is focusing on November 2016.  So, lets look at the two sides.  Trump has ... Trump. (And his kids, and Kasich).  It's a one (and a half) ring circus, with one star.  Hillary has ... Oh my god... Everyone.  Tonight I watched Bernie shift to become a strong backer of Hillary.  (Bernie, I have never been more impressed with you.)  (To me, Bernie's was the most important speech of the convention.)  Last week I watched Cruz scream fire in a crowded theater.  I watched Michelle talk about protection, education and mentors of our children, and trust in Hillary.  I watched Melania Trump give a stiff, but good speech, to find out some of it was plagiarized.  I watched Elizabeth Warren on message and effective.  I expedited an old actor to start talking to an empty chair.  My point is the Republicans were incompetent, self serving, and felt like an off script Apprentice, the Democrats were organized, enthusiastic, and (mostly) for Hillary.  Further, from what I see, Trump will be for ... wait for it ... Trump.  Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders (I'm still proud) et. al. are at least making motions like they will help Hillary win.  And a lot of these folks will focus on a hand full of states.  Oh My God.  The other issue is organization.  From what I understand. Hillary has been creating infrastructure for over a year.  She has boots on the ground, ads in the schedule, and money in the bank.  Trump ... hopes the RNC can help him out.  Donors are contributing to Hillary, and until the last month, The Donald was using Twitter.  Trump thinks in 140 characters or less.  Don't get me wrong, the clown still gets lots of attention.  Interesting comparison. Changing my forecast at the state level at last for a few months to 1/2 the distance from the 538 blog to 90% Hillary.  Things to watch for is shock and awe by the Democrats, or the Circus is winning for the Republicans.  (Rounding to the nearest 5% towards 538 , i.e., lean to the mean).
