Country Reports: Middle East and North Africa Overview - 2015: http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257517.htm\n- In 2015, Iran\u2019s state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide remained undiminished through the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), its Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and Tehran\u2019s ally Hizballah, which remained a significant threat to the stability of Lebanon and the broader region. \n\nChapter 3: State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview: http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/257520.htm\n- IRAN\nDesignated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2015, including support for Hizballah, Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, and various groups in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. In 2015, Iran increased its assistance to Iraqi Shia terrorist groups, including Kata\u2019ib Hizballah (KH), which is a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, as part of an effort to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and bolster the Asad regime in Syria. Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to implement foreign policy goals, provide cover for intelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. The IRGC-QF is Iran\u2019s primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad. Iran views the Asad regime in Syria as a crucial ally, a pillar in its \u201cresistance\u201d front together with sub-national groups aligned with Iran, and a key link to Hizballah, Iran\u2019s primary beneficiary and terrorist partner. In addition to its ongoing support for Hizballah in Syria, Iran continued to provide arms, financing, training, and the facilitation of primarily Iraqi, Afghan, and Pakistani Shia fighters to support the Asad regime\u2019s brutal crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of more than 250,000 people in Syria. Iran more openly acknowledged the deaths of Iranian personnel in Syria in 2015, including several senior commanders, and increased Iranian troop levels, while continuing to claim publicly that Iranian forces had only deployed in an advisory role. In Iraq, Iranian combat forces employed rockets, artillery, and drones against ISIL. Iran also increased its arming and funding of Iraqi Shia terrorist groups in an effort to reverse ISIL gains in Iraq. Many of these groups, such as KH, have exacerbated sectarian tensions in Iraq and have committed serious human rights abuses against primarily Sunni civilians. The IRGC-QF, in concert with Hizballah, provided training outside of Iraq, as well as advisors inside Iraq for Shia militants in the construction and use of advanced weaponry. Similar to Hizballah fighters, many of these trained Shia militants have used these skills to fight for the Asad regime in Syria or against ISIL in Iraq. Iran has also provided weapons, funding, and training to Shia militants in Bahrain. In 2015, the Government of Bahrain raided, interdicted, and rounded up numerous Iran-sponsored weapons caches, arms transfers, and militants. This includes the Bahraini government\u2019s discovery of a bomb-making facility with 1.5 tons of high-grade explosives in September. Iran has historically provided weapons, training, and funding to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. These Palestinian terrorist groups have been behind a number of deaths from attacks originating in Gaza and the West Bank. Although Hamas\u2019s ties to Tehran have been strained due to the Syrian civil war, both sides took steps in 2015 to repair relations. Iran continued to declare its vocal support for Palestinian terrorist groups and its hostility to Israel in 2015. Supreme National Security Council Secretary Admiral Ali Shamkhani sought to frame a series of individual Palestinian attacks on Israeli security forces in the West Bank as a new \u201cIntifada\u201d in a speech on November 25. Since the end of the 2006 Israeli-Hizballah conflict in 2006, Iran has also assisted in rearming Hizballah, in direct violation of UNSCR 1701. Iran has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Hizballah in Lebanon and has trained thousands of its fighters at camps in Iran. These trained fighters have used these skills in direct support of the Asad regime in Syria and, to a lesser extent, in support of operations against ISIL in Iraq. They have also carried out isolated attacks along the Lebanese border with Israel. Iran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) members it continued to detain and refused to publicly identify the members in its custody. Iran previously allowed AQ facilitators to operate a core facilitation pipeline through Iran since at least 2009, enabling AQ to move funds and fighters to South Asia and Syria.

As it turns out, under the Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), there are now limitations on what the IAEA is allowed to report. According to Amano, due to new U.N. Security Council and IAEA resolutions, the agency will only monitor and verify Iran\u2019s compliance with its JCPOA commitments and will no longer provide broad reporting on its nuclear program.

Iran\u2019s missile programs began in the 1980s, largely with technology and skills provided by Russia, China, and North Korea. Missile assistance to Iran has been precluded by international sanctions since 2006, although there continue to be reports of Iran-North Korea missile cooperation in violation of these restrictions. Conventional arms sales and military training for Iran were banned in 2010, and remain so until 2020 under U.N. Resolution 2231, which implemented the Iran nuclear deal.  While Iran-Russia military cooperation in Syria has deepened and the countries have discussed new arms sales to Iran, Russia has not shown any inclination to violate the resolution outright. The resolution does not prohibit joint military activities such as Russia\u2019s use of Iran\u2019s airbases for bomber strikes or Russia-Iran ground cooperation in Syria.  The Pentagon report also addresses a key question that has clouded the nuclear deal since its inception\u2014how Iran\u2019s regional strategy and activities might change as a consequence of the deal. The report assesses that \u2018Iran\u2019s covert activities also are continuing unabated. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2013Qods Force (IRGC-QF) remains a key tool of Iran\u2019s foreign policy and power projection, particularly in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Yemen.\u2019 This assessment contradicts more hopeful assessments that the nuclear deal would moderate Iran\u2019s behavior and suggests that Iran is harnessing its expanding weapons arsenal in efforts to increase its regional influence. Iran\u2019s weapons supplies to its regional allies and proxies have helped keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power; empowered Zaydi Shi\u2019a Houthi rebels in Yemen against a Saudi-led coalition; supported 80,000 Shi\u2019a militia fighters in Iraq; and enabled radical underground Shi\u2019a factions in Bahrain to conduct successful improvised explosive device attacks on security forces. All of these activities have put military and political pressure on Iran\u2019s foremost regional rival, Saudi Arabia, which is undertaking activities opposed to those of Iran in virtually all of these theaters. Iran has been known to provide advanced weaponry to its key proxy, Lebanese Hizballah, in the past. The transfer of even modest amounts of its most sophisticated missiles to Hizballah will likely ensure that any new Israel-Hizballah war could escalate into a regional, and potentially even global, conflagration.\" LWJ, August 21, 'Analysis: IRGC implicated in arming Yemeni Houthis with missiles': http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/08/analysis-irgc-implicated-in-arming-yemeni-houthis-with-missiles.php Comments: IR hardliners in the ascendency.

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has trained, armed, supported, and collaborated with a wide variety of radical Shia and Sunni militant groups, as well as Arab, Palestinian, Kurdish, and Afghan groups that do not share its radical Islamist ideology. The IRGC\u2019s elite Quds (Jerusalem) Force has cultivated, trained, armed, and supported numerous proxies, particularly the Lebanon-based Hizbullah; Iraqi Shia militant groups; Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad; and groups that have fought against the governments of Afghanistan, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Yemen. \u201cIran is the world\u2019s foremost sponsor of terrorism and has made extensive efforts to export its radical Shia brand of Islamist revolution. It has found success in establishing a network of powerful Shia revolutionary groups in Lebanon and Iraq; has cultivated links with Afghan Shia and Taliban militants; and has stirred Shia unrest in Bahrain, Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. In 2013, Iranian arms shipments were intercepted by naval forces off the coasts of Bahrain and Yemen, and Israel intercepted a shipment of arms, including long-range rockets, bound for Palestinian militants in Gaza.\u201d The Heritage Foundation\nThe Heritage Foundation is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.

To that end, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has placed an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander at the head of the country's complex military establishment. Maj. Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri took office as the new chief of the Armed Forces General Staff on July 5, marking the first time that the IRGC's leader has filled the position. Because the IRGC is widely perceived to be the best-equipped and best-trained branch of the Iranian military, the country's leaders may be hoping to bring the rest of the defense forces up to speed by having them follow the IRGC's example.\nBut another motive could be behind the promotion. Iran's economy is opening up as a result of the country's recent nuclear deal with the West, and some of Iran's most powerful stakeholders \u2014 the IRGC included \u2014 could see their strength erode because of it. Granting the military organization control over other politicized institutions, such as the armed forces, may be Khamenei's way of ensuring the IRGC's continued influence and, in doing so, protecting his control over one of Iran's most formidable groups.'\nSee also my earlier postings of [IRGC] Quds force Qasem Soleimani running ground ops in IQ.\nDropping 1 basis point.

In fact, this is a vocal sore point for detractors of the nuclear deal and government officials are basically saying that we have to take this one step at a time and we are focused on the nuclear program at this time.

President submit a report to Congress before the proposed rescission would take effect certifying that:\n--There has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government of the country concerned (afoyfs: parliamentarian elections may weaken conservatives' position but there's been no major change in the leadership and policy of Iran's government in its support of regional influences in the Middle East),\n--The government is not supporting acts of international terrorism (afoyfs: evidence to the contrary in the State Department's report for 2014), and\n--The government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future (afoyfs: no dice). 2. President submit a report to Congress, at least 45 days before the proposed rescission would take effect, justifying the rescission and certifying that:\n--The government concerned has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period (afoyfs: evidence of Iran's support for terrorist organizations in 2014), and\n--The government concerned has provided assurances that that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future (afoyfs: no dice). Here is the litany of charges for which Iran is on this list:\n-- Iran continued its terrorist-related activity in 2014, including support for Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, Lebanese Hizballah, and various groups in Iraq and throughout the Middle East.\n-- This year, Iran increased its assistance to Iraqi Shia militias, one of which is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), in response to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) incursion into Iraq, and has continued to support other militia groups in the region.\n-- Iran also attempted to smuggle weapons to Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza. \n-- Iran and its proxies also continued subtle efforts at growing influence elsewhere including in Africa, Asia, and, to a lesser extent, Latin America. Iran used the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) to implement foreign policy goals, provide cover for intelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East.

It's really hard to get taken off a terrorist list - True for states and individuals, unless the US sees a desperate reason to take someone off the list (Iraq, post invasion), Libya and North Korea (as part of a bargain to end their nuclear weapons programs). Additionally, both of the latter two states were considered by the State Department to be either no longer involved in sponsoring terror (North Korea) or actively aiding the US in counter-terror operations (Libya) for years prior to their removal. (http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2005/64337.htm). Nelson Mandela, while not a state, but on the State Department's rolls as a terrorist, had to wait until 2008 to get his name off the list; even a Nobel Peace Prize isn't a sure-fire way to escape classification as a terrorist, once you're on the list. (http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/us-government-considered-nelson-mandela-terrorist-until-2008-f2D11708787).

Most Washington foreign policy groups feel that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are deeply intertwined with every level of the Iranian economy, and that their Quds force is an active supporter of terrorist groups (http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-revolutionary-guards/p14324). The likelihood that anyone within shouting distance of the President is saying anything other than that Iran is a state sponsor of terror seems very low. I leave a 1% chance at Iran being removed because the list of state sponsors of terrorism has received some criticism in recent years.

Starting the process as a ploy would provide the pretext for Iranian moderates to point to the enormous economic benefits that U.S. commercial investment would bring in order to gain influence within Tehran. 2) Lure Armenia & Azerbaijan away from the Russian-Iranian partnership to gain a stronger Eurasia position (i.e. scenario such as a false-flag provocations ) Long seen as the West\u2019s prized partner in the Caspian, 2015 saw a remarkable cooling of Azeri-Western relations over the latter\u2019s strong criticism of Baku\u2019s human rights record. While political and non-energy economic ties (e.g. EU membership) appear to be at a standstill, oil and gas still flow unimpeded through its territory, and Azerbaijan is expected to be the main source for the EU\u2019s anti-Russian Southern Energy Corridor. Interestingly enough, Azerbaijan has moved considerably closer to both Russia and Iran in the past year, excitedly raising the prospects that a trilateral partnership between the three (perhaps via the North-South Corridor) could neutralize the unipolar intentions of the US and EU and flip Baku into a becoming a multipolar pump of energy influence towards the West. Of course, the US would never allow Azerbaijan to become a strategic weapon against it, Turkey, or Israel\u2019s interests (the latter of whichreceives 40% of its oil needs from the country) without some sort of Color Revolution disruption first, so as this realignment scenario moves forward, one can simultaneously expect more Western hostility towards Azerbaijan and friendly outreaches towards Armenia. \nsource: http://www.globalresearch.ca/2016-trends-and-geopolitical-forecast-mega-analysis-of-europe-eurasia-and-the-middle-east/5498329 Now I'll provide the con side \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------James Clapper's testimony today and report said: \"Iran\u2014the foremost state sponsor of terrorism\u2014continues to exert its influence in regional crises \" (top of page 6)   http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Clapper_02-09-16.pdf\n-- \nKerry and Obama have been on record stating the Iranian Deal would not affect their position at the top of the State Sponsored Terrorist list.

That was in April of last year, but Cuba wasn't *officially* removed from the list for another 45 days. Why? There was 45-day review period where Congress could consider blocking the action with a join resolution. So, even if we allow for the fact that the Obama administration might do something unexpected (like this) [as a quick aside -- let's remember that Obama ordered a review of Cuba in December, so 4 months prior them being taken off the list], but right let's forget both of those things for a moment... this act of removing Iran from this list would still have to get through the GOP Congress -- in an election year!
