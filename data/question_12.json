Please note that the question was about whether OPEC would ANNOUNCE changes to its production quota. It did not do that. We also don't consider the failure to reach a decision on the quota as evidence that the quota has changed.

The Saudis will not budge (see my comment of Oct 23).  Since no other OPEC country is willing to cut production, the cartel now stands in ruins.  The argument and the essence of the question was never about whether to increase the OPEC production.  Given the current supply/demand context, that would be nonsensical.  Failure to maintain or reduce the production quota, is simply failure.  When a cartel cannot reach an effective agreement to limit production and control prices, it is no longer a functioning entity.  Sifting through the wreckage misses this reality.  OPEC no longer has the capacity to change any production quota.  That's just gone.

It seems the most likely scenario if they are going to raise the ceiling. A change due to the inclusion of Indonesia would be breaking precedent based on what I've read in the comments. Other articles have indicated that a raise in the ceiling has been interpreted as a bearish signal by the markets.  While it could be interpreted as a \"positive\" signal by non-OPEC producers to acknowledge the reality, adding Indonesia AND officially recognizing the current output would be a sure signal that their current overproduction strategy may be here to stay for a while despite being only a \"technical\" correction; as well as perhaps a signal that the future price ceilings to accommodate Indonesia may be in store. I'd say that's bearish for prices. Coupled with the Saudi's increased discount price to the U.S., a technical correction would clearly be yet another signal not to expect production cuts soon - not really a possibility but just to drive hope the point. Speaking of the Saudi discount, though an inflammatory move within OPEC, perhaps it serves to maintain the ceiling at 30. While the Saudi's don't want to cut and they are playing a game of attrition, they may use it to argue keeping it the ceiling at 30 to appease other OPEC members...not that they've really ever seemed to care about that before. I guess one question would be whether recognizing current output could happen without making an official change to the ceiling. The article suggests such a recognition would be a de facto change, but there seem to be more signals pointing to staying the course.

Although Saudi officials have denied the claim \u2014 and the report of the claim even noted that an agreement is unlikely to materialize at the meeting \u2014 there has been a subtle shift in the Saudi kingdom's tone on its oil policy. According to the leaked plan, Riyadh would call for an oil production cut of 1 million barrels per day with three requirements. First, the cut would need to include countries outside of OPEC, such as Mexico, Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan. Second, Iraq would need to freeze production at its current level (around 4.3 million bpd). Third, Iran would need to participate in the production cut. This plan would seem like an optimal one for Saudi Arabia, and it is not an entirely new idea for Riyadh; the Saudis have been consistent in their position that they would let the market do what it pleases and would only partake in a production cut if everyone in OPEC, not just Saudi Arabia, did so. The big change over the past few months is that Saudi Arabia's rhetoric seems to suggest that Riyadh is more open to the idea and could be on the verge of trying to take a more proactive position in organizing a production cut during the next year or two. Next year could be an optimal time for Saudi Arabia, or all of OPEC, to change its position...\"\"\"\""], [498, "2015-12-03T22:57:26Z", [0.95], "My thinking on this is as follows. They have this central issue that needs to be addressed in some way, at least symbolically:\n\u2022 Current nominal group \"production ceiling:\" 30 million bpd*\n\u2022 Actual group production (including Indonesia): 33 million bpd\n\u2022 Symbolic imbalance: 3 million bpd (This is a credibility imbalance.) Thus, after much haggling, they will do with an increase in the production ceiling to approximately 31 million bpd, accompanied by a pledge (a kind-of, sort-of pledge) to adhere more strictly to the ceiling. (As discussed before, although there may not be \"quotas\" per se, there are, behind the scenes, informal \"production targets\" that members use to approach a country-by-country allocation of the ceiling [the \"secret sauce.]) This is the only move they can make that will not throw the markets into panic one way or the other. Given the proper spin, it can even be presented as striving toward a 6% short-term \"cut.\" They will announce an extraordinary meeting for early 2016 to address the increase from Iran of approximately 0.5 million bpd,, which they look forward to accommodating in an orderly fashion. (There is no need to address these new barrels right now since they are in the future anyway.) The extraordinary meeting will also have an eye toward monitoring the production discipline of all members, etc., etc. [I don't have a good enough understanding of middle-eastern culture, for if I did, with all due respect to Venezuela, et. al., I'd throw in some metaphor about getting the stubborn camel to get moving ...] * The 30 million bpd ceiling was first introduced, I believe, in 2009. Obviously the call of world demand from OPEC has increased since then. Even without Indonesia, the ceiling has fallen behind.

Together with the U.S., it\u2019s responsible for most of the global surplus this year. That\u2019s unlikely to persist in 2016, according to industry forecasters: Iraq is struggling with prices below $50 and is embroiled in a \u201ccostly battle\u201d with Islamic State militants, the International Energy Agency said last month. Even its oil minister expects production growth to slow next year. KUWAIT\nPrice needed: $67\nShare of OPEC production: 8.7 percent\nKuwait is in the strongest position to weather a prolonged period of low oil prices thanks to its current-account surplus, according to Capital Economics Ltd. The country, along with other Persian Gulf members of OPEC, opposed Venezuela\u2019s proposal for an oil-price summit with non-OPEC producers, the Wall Street Journal reported. LIBYA\nPrice needed: $269\nShare of OPEC production: 1.3 percent\nOPEC\u2019s smallest producer, Libya has been unable to restore output to the 1.6 million barrel-a-day level it reached before the Arab Spring in 2011. Production has swung between 250,000 and 850,000 barrels a day in the past year amid an escalating conflict between the divided country\u2019s rival governments. Libya is one of OPEC\u2019s \u201cFragile Five\u201d nations that face greater risk of significant instability and output disruptions in the current oil market, according to RBC Capital Markets Ltd. NIGERIA\nPrice needed: $120 (ING)\nShare of OPEC production: 6.3 percent\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has said oil at $40 isn\u2019t acceptable and OPEC needs to do more to enforce production quotas. The country would consider $60 a barrel more \u201ctolerable,\u201d he said Nov. 21. QATAR\nPrice needed: $55.50\nShare of OPEC production: 2 percent\nAmong OPEC, Qatar boasts the lowest fiscal break-even oil price to balance its budget. That\u2019s still about $10 above current prices. Energy Minister Mohammed Al Sada has said there are signs of a market recovery next year as non-OPEC supply growth is set to slow. SAUDI ARABIA\nPrice needed: $106\nShare of OPEC production: 32 percent\nSaudi Arabia has boosted output in nine of the past 11 months as OPEC\u2019s biggest producer keeps its strategy of defending market share. The nation pumped a record 10.6 million barrels a day in July. Yet it\u2019s not immune to the slump in prices. Despite having a war chest of $647 billion of foreign-exchange reserves, its credit rating was cut by Standard & Poor\u2019s in October on concern the country\u2019s reliance on energy exports for 80 percent of revenue will drive up the budget deficit. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\nPrice needed: $73\nShare of OPEC production: 9.2 percent\nThe U.A.E.\u2019s oil minister, Suhail Al Mazrouei, said Nov. 18 that OPEC shouldn\u2019t be considered a swing producer but rather a steady, low-cost supplier. Mazrouei also said last month he expects a \u201cgradual correction\u201d in prices next year. VENEZUELA\nPrice needed: $125 (ING)\nShare of OPEC production: 7.8 percent\nVenezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino has urged OPEC to adopt an \u201cequilibrium price\u201d of $88 a barrel that covers the cost of new investment in production capacity, or risk prices dropping to the mid-$20s.

But Saudi Arabia and some other countries are against reintroduction of the quotas system,\u201d Zanganeh said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I do not see the establishment of a by-nation quota system, but I can imagine changes:  increasing the overall quota, adding a quota for Iran's increased production or Indonnesia, or abolishing their overall production quota entirely."], [38, "2015-11-28T08:52:03Z", [0.55], "http://oracleherald.com/2015/11/27/will-crude-oil-prices-react-to-the-december-opec-meeting.html \"Some have called the oil exporters' refusal to cut production the biggest mistake in the group's history. But, right now, there's nothing to suggest that any such pact is even a remote possibility, and few OPEC watchers expect the oil producer group to do anything other than rubber-stamp current output policy at talks in Vienna next week.\n. . . \n\"As the 12-member OPEC group prepares to meet next week, Venezuela has warned that crude could drop to as low as the mid-$20s a barrel unless action is taken to stabilize the market. It is hard to see Saudi Arabia doing an about-face at this point on its strategy. If the data is correct and finally the Saudi policy is gaining some traction, then why would they wish to alter course? \"While Saudi Arabia isn't immune to the crisis, which has forced it to burn through currency reserves and tap bond markets to plug a 20 per cent budget deficit, the kingdom still has enough financial firepower to see the strategy through.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.nasdaq.com/article/oil-prices-move-lower-opec-production-quota-eyed-20151126-00224#ixzz3slroNsiS \"Concerns about an unrelenting global surplus was further reinforced by expectations that the Saudi Arabia-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will press on with its strategy of pumping out oil at a high pace and let market forces determine the prices.\n. . . \n\". .  . the market holds conflicting views what the bloc will do. Phillip Futures energy analyst Daniel Ang said despite reports that Saudi Arabia has signalled its willingness to work with other producers to stabilize the market, unless major oil leaders make concrete commitments, the meeting will largely be a \"non-event,\" he said.  Barnabas Gan, an economist at OCBC, expects the bloc to ramp up its daily production from roughly around 31 million barrels a day to 33 million barrels a day as it appears the strategy of inundating the market with supplies to defend its market share and squeeze out lesser competitors seems to be working. . . . \"From a fundamental point of view, an increase in OPEC's production quota is much required; Indonesia's inclusion into the cartel will add roughly 800,000 barrels a day into the overall production pipeline will give OPEC the perfect excuse to propose a higher quota,\" said Mr. Gan.  Moreover, OPEC will need to account for potentially higher oil production from Iran and Libya as well, he added.\n~~~~~~~\n http://www.smh.com.au/business/cheap-oil-to-stay-as-opec-confronts-oversupply-20151125-gl7fho.html#ixzz3slslq1x7  \"For those expecting OPEC's meeting in Vienna next week to herald a return to the years of $US100 ($138) per barrel oil prices, analysts have a clear message: forget about it. Not only will the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries not cut production, it's possible that the current daily production quota of 30 million barrels of crude. . .  could even be formally lifted.\n. . . \n\"OPEC is extracting [more oil] than the allowed quota,\" Iranian oil minister Bijan Zangeneh said last week. \"I asked them to cut oil output to meet the quota. But it does not mean that we will not be producing more oil because it is our right to come back to the market.\" Mr Zangeneh added that \"I do not expect a new agreement [on the quota] to be made on December 4.\"  \"NAB economist Vyanne Lai said the smaller and poorer members of OPEC such as Venezuela, Ecuador, Algeria and Angola would be pushing hard for a cut in the quota to boost prices. But they probably wouldn't succeed. \"Complicating the debate about the quota and Iran is the fact that Indonesia is being readmitted into OPEC after seven years on the sidelines. Indonesia produces 800,000 barrels of oil per day and the OPEC quota would probably be adjusted when Indonesia joined, she said. But that would not weigh on prices as Indonesia has been producing oil the whole time it has been out of OPEC.  The other interesting point about Indonesia, said Ms Lai, is because it is a net oil importer \"within the OPEC dynamics it's not really adding to the competition but taking some away from it.\"\n. . . \n\"CLSA oil analyst Nelson Wang said the overwhelming consensus was that OPEC would not cut production in Vienna. \"I think the right thing for them to do would be to hang on to their production target, which is 30 million barrels per day. After all, they've been producing above that target already for quite some time,\" he said. What might happen instead, he said, was that OPEC would incrementally increase its production quota in line with production increases from Iran, which he expected to resume exports by half a million barrels by the middle of next year. He said the OPEC strategy of trying to win back market share from US shale oil producers had only been partly successful. \"We've seen US oil production declining but not as much as most people expected. I think the US shale oil output will continue to decline over the next few years, which will control some of the oversupply in the market.\" \"But despite the bearish mood there is increasing speculation that some officials in Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most powerful member, would prefer a higher price.

Saudi Arabia knows that shale is a very dangerous technology for them in terms of losing economic dominance over the oil trade, and they intend to knock it out.

In addition,  new technology is beginning to make the break even points of shale decline. In other words,  new technology is making shale increasingly efficient. To counteract this,  Saudi Arabia is not only going to keep prices low,  it's going to have to pump more oil than ever before.  Likewise, in an attempt to stop some of the economic hemorrhaging the country is currently facing, Saudi Arabia will produce more oil in an  attempt to recoup some loses via increased market share.

This reality may preclude OPEC members from taking any action. However, when people are hurting, there is pressure to \"do something\".   Every member of OPEC would benefit from higher prices, but the members MOST eager to limit production or take other action in hopes of increasing the price of oil are the members LEAST likely to abide by any quota or rules imposed on them.  Establishing a price floor or quotas may sound appealing but without any enforcement, those producers willing to sell below that price floor or increase production will increase their market share and undermine the effort. Last year, Saudi Arabia's respected, veteran oil minister's arguments prevailed. This year, SA will not have such a powerful and respected person at the table, so its arguments may not carry as much weight.  Furthermore, it is reported that the kingdom has been shaken by the recent assessment by Standard & Poor that it cannot sustain current government spending levels at this price, so perhaps it will soften its position.  OPEC operates on a principal It operates on the principle of unanimity, and one member, one vote. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC) Members that are pro-quota/pro-change include:  Iran, Venezuela, Algeria, Iraq, Nigeria, Ecuador,  Libya, and Angola. Members that have sufficient reserves or low enough production costs to survive another year of low oil prices include:  Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Kuwait. Indonesia will join, making 13. The way I count the votes, it looks like there will be some sort of change.  This question asks about a production quota change; if the change OPEC adopts is to establish a price floor, the question will resolve as \"no\".  Some producers are so desperate for oil revenue (Venezuela, Iran) that I think a production quota will be more appealing to them than a price floor, since they can sell oil like mad up to their quota, but a price floor might cause sales to shift immediately to non-OPEC producers.\n"], [368, "2015-11-08T22:30:51Z", [0.0], ""], [8159, "2015-11-08T20:50:54Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2015-11-08T13:46:21Z", [0.05], ""], [11026, "2015-11-08T10:55:29Z", [0.08], ""], [231, "2015-11-07T21:34:09Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2015-11-07T20:25:07Z", [0.0], "Current policy relies on market share rather than production quota's.

I have thought that perhaps OPEC would lift its quota ceiling to bring it into closer alignment with actual production, or to acknowledge anticipated increased production by Iran, but what would be the point: it  would not reduce supply and/or increase the price of oil.   As for my idea that maybe KSA would want a quota slapped on Iran (so that with the lifting of sanctions its increased  production  doesn't make things worse) I've not read of that either.

And OPEC's most dominant member, Saudi Arabia, has been cutting prices to secure new markets. \"According to OPEC\u2019s October report, oil production within the organization increased by 0.11 million bpd to 31.57 million bpd in September. \"OPEC will meet on December 4 in Vienna to announce its output strategy. \n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.ft.com/intl/fastft/409991/iran-opec-oil \"The head of Iran's state oil company said he will demand Opec return to output quotas to try tighten the market and boost the oil price, as the country prepares to raise its own exports after years of sanctions. \"Roknodin Javadi, head of the National Iranian Oil Company and deputy oil minister, said oil prices below $50 a barrel were hurting all Opec members, and the producers group needed to once again act in union to create a price recovery, report Anjli Raval and Najmeh Bozorgmehr in Tehran. \"Because of the low oil price and complication of market, everyone is losing,\" Mr Javadi told the FT . . .  \n\"Nobody is respecting the quota today. If everybody respects the quota that is good enough,\" adding that Iran is \"insisting that everybody sticks to quota of 2 years ago, 3 years ago.\" \"Last November, Saudi Arabia led Opec in deciding not to cut production to bolster prices, choosing to instead focus on market share for longer term gains . . . But the collapse in prices to less than $50 a barrel has hurt many Opec members. \"Two months ahead of the next meeting of Opec ministers, Mr Javadi said \"there is lobbying\" for a cut in production. \"There are small hopes that maybe they'll agree on a small reduction.\"  Mr Javadi said a small output cut may not have a huge impact on the price but it would \"not make it worse\" after prices hit the lowest level since the financial crisis in August.  . . . \"Iran is unlikely to participate in any attempt to support the market, however. Mr Javadi said Iran was not in a position to restrain its output after years of sanctions curbing its production, costing the country more than $120bn in export losses.  \"We have the same situation that Iraq had after the war\u2026they didn't accept any [cut in] quota because they would need to rebuild [their export] market and industry. We are in the same situation,\" Mr Javadi said. \"Rumours have swirled about cooperation between Opec and Non-Opec on output cuts ahead of a meeting of oil experts from producer countries this week. But many industry watchers do not expect a change in strategy, with Saudi Arabia - the world's largest exporter - keen to squeeze out higher-cost rivals. Russia, the largest exporter outside Opec, has held numerous talks with the cartel, but has always said it is unable to cut output.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I got badly burned on a question like this last fall because I under-estimated the persuasive power of Saudi Arabia.

OPEC members and non-members are expected to come together on Oct. 21 for a technical meeting. At that meeting, it is expected that Venezuela will unveil a strategy from the old playbook used by OPEC and suggest it revert back to its price band strategy to revive the oil price. \"What the country is proposing is to set up a series of progressive oil production cuts to control prices.  . . . \n\"The band system strategy was first employed by OPEC after oil prices crashed in the late 1990s, when it had a $22 to $28 per barrel band. That strategy worked relatively well until 2005, when demand for oil surged, leading prices to rise past the upper level of the band. The key to that strategy was to keep production in line with demand so that oil wouldn't drop past the $22 per barrel floor. To do so, OPEC, and in some cases non-members, would coordinate a production cut to stabilize the oil price during periods of weaker demand. \"We saw this strategy in action in 2001, when OPEC worked with non-members to coordinate a production cut in order to boost oil prices back into the price band of $22 to $28 per barrel. The coordinated cut was announced at an emergency OPEC meeting at the end of December 2001, as OPEC agreed to a 1.5 million barrel per day production cut, which coincided with a combined 462,500 per day production cut by non-OPEC producers Russia, Norway, and Mexico. \"The strategy clearly worked, as crude prices quickly rebounded back into the upper end of OPEC's price band. \"For such a strategy to work this time around, OPEC will need some level of non-member participation since it has made it abundantly clear that it won't cut alone. The problem lies in the fact that there have been mixed signals from both Russia and Mexico as to their willingness to join a coordinated production cut, while Norway has already said it wouldn't join a cut this time around since its production is no longer as high as it once was because of the declining output from the North Sea. \"Mexico is reluctant to cut for the same reason. Its Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Caldwell told Reuters last month that, \"Mexico is not influencing overproduction because Mexico's oil output has been steadily declining,\" and therefore, \"it would be unacceptable for us to have to cut when our output is already declining,\" saying that a production cut \"is not an option.\" However, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who has been working with Venezuela on getting consensus on a production cut, said Mexico \"expressed readiness to cooperate with OPEC should OPEC decide to enter market management.\" So, it's really hard to tell where it stands.  \"Likewise, Russia has been sending mixed signals. Its Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters earlier this month that it is ready to meet with OPEC and non-OPEC producers to discuss the current oil market situation. However, the country's oil producers said they won't cooperate with OPEC. In fact, one of the country's top oil producers, Rosneft, went so far as to blame OPEC for the continued problems in the oil market. Its CEO Igor Sechin said, \"They fail to observe their own quotas [for OPEC oil output]. If quotas had been observed, global oil markets would have been rebalanced by now.\" In other words, we wouldn't need a coordinated production cut if OPEC wasn't already producing more than its stated quota.   \"Venezuela is hoping that by reviving an old strategy it can improve the oil price and, therefore, its economy. However, it still faces a tough sell, as such a move is predicated upon non-OPEC members joining a cut again, as they have in the past.

Gulf Arabs are more inclined to accept a lower price to keep consumers hooked on cheap gasoline and thus extend the Age of Oil.

The Mexicans say their focus is on restoring the productivity of their biggest field.

Much thanks for disabusing me of the notion that the proffered correlation between the total OPEC group quota and that of individual members is no more than a simple summation. It is, in fact, a \"secret sauce\" clouded by obfuscation (at least for neophytes such as myself). Frankly, the whole thing is a complete semantic nightmare. There are quotas, targets, estimates, etc. Official OPEC communications seem to no longer even reference the word \"quota,\" but instead use the word \"ceiling.\" It seems, then, that there are two sets of variables:\n1) An official group \"ceiling\" of 30 million barrels/day production\n2) An official (?) set of \"production targets\" for 12 of the 13 OPEC members That set #2 variables exist cannot be disputed (see link to Platts website below). Where these country-specific \"production targets\" come from (who generates them) is unclear. Platts states thay they are set by OPEC. Whether the country-specific \"production targets\" can be summed into the 30 million b/d ceiling is unknown. On the publicly accessible portion of the Platts website the country specific production targets are only shown month-to-month historically. \"OPEC's 30 million b/d ceiling has been in place since January 2012. It does not include individual country quotas.\"\n\"OPEC sets a production target for twelve of its 13 members. Iraq ... does not have a production quota.\"\nhttp://www.platts.com/news-feature/2014/oil/opec-guide/prod_table My guess is that if one worked through the Platts website (a subscription service), a definitive answer to the question of how the country-specific \"production targets\" correlate to the overall group \"ceiling\" could be obtained. OPEC is, however, a cartel, and the correlation does not need to make any rational sense. They can, for example, in \"magic-like\" fashion, simply ignore the logic of mathematical summation, or, not apportion any \"production target\" to some countries (as with Iraq currently). The point I've been arguing in support of my forecast, however, is that OPEC will try to maintain some semblance of a rational correlation. Else, what is recognized as \"magic-like,\" reveals itself to be mere \"magic,\" and the whole world, including many OPEC producers themselves, simply walk away. Or, in other words, if you accept that the two sets of variables need to be generated under OPEC auspices, what do you think they will be? To my mind, it's a problem for OPEC.

No. Oil prices are in the $40 range, which is a price range that I think Saudi Arabia is willing to live with for a while.\nWill OPEC re-institute country-specific quotas as a way of dealing with new production from Iran (or anyone else)? No, because (a) that's kind of a big deal, and they'll have to do it for all OPEC countries, (b) nobody, least of all Iran, will follow it right now, (d) Iran won't rally be pumping a lot by Dec. 4 anyways, and (d) they don't really care about quotas anyway.

Iran already has an OPEC quota (I think), but to not recognize they want to sell more now that sanctions are being lifted is unrealistic. The potential for total chaos in world oil markets exists, and I think Saudi Arabia knows that it would be better to prevent this than to try to fix it after. Honestly, I think OPEC will make a very, very minor cut in the group quota, with Saudi Arabia stepping up and taking the entire reduction (albeit very small) all on themselves.

It is driving some oil out of the market and reducing exploration & development of new sources.  High cost exploration & develop in the Arctic in Alaska & Russia  has been dramatically cut back in the last year.  All alternative energy sources (solar, wind, etc) become less viable when oil is cheap, so low priced oil slows R & D in alternative energy and stretches out the dominance of oil in the energy sector.

Does he have the respect, clout or vision to continue to dominate OPEC?\n5) Venezuela's leader Maduro's economic policies have been recognized as a major source of Venezuela's problems so OPEC members may not have much sympathy for Venezuela's problems or pleas.

Reduced dependence on foreign crude will remain a hot-button, as it provides fodder for stump speeches. Americans are particularly responsive to tough talk; and in a field crowded with candidates, with no clear front-runner, the fourth quarter 2015 will be a time for stumping and much podium pounding. A spike in per barrel prices will inflame the drive for US oil production to stay in business, despite profit drains. Therefore, it  is in the interest of all OPEC member countries to keep prices low; i.e, at or near quota.   Meanwhile, all eyes are on Iran.

We're only at the beginning of the fallout here; although there has been some damage (i.e. corporate failure, or cancellation of projects), some other suppliers have successfully cut costs.\n- Certain markets have baked-in selling prices that are higher than Brent or WTI due to politics or supply chain issues; some OPEC members are selling at higher prices than the market looks like as a result.\n-There are active conflicts between some of the OPEC members (i.e. Gulf States vs Iran)\n- Despite the world being \"awash\" with oil, there are storage considerations that may limit output.\n- There are a number of supply-chain choke-points (Straits of Hormuz is only one example) that can easily get blocked as a result of geopolitical or even weather related issues; this means that the price has the possibility of spiking upwards regardless of current supply.

Pressure is building on Saudi Arabia from members within Opec to agree to an emergency meeting to arrest oil prices which are plummeting towards levels of $40 per barrel.  Opec\u2019s next scheduled gathering is due to take place in December but Algeria, Venezuela and a number of other members including Iran are now supporting an earlier meeting to discuss production levels  Algeria has circulated a letter within Opec, lobbying for oil ministers to discuss measures to restore prices. These could include introducing individual production quotas within the group which would prevent certain countries from over-producing. Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision last November to increase its own production, which accounts for around third of the group\u2019s output, to more than 10.6 million barrels per day (bpd) has made it impossible for other members to raise their production.\nThe country's oil policy has also opened up deep divisions within the group, especially with fellow Middle East power Iran. Riyadh has come under increasing criticism from within Opec for its determination to maintain a policy which has allowed oil prices to go into freefall since last November. Saudi Arabia and its close Gulf allies, such as the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, now account for over 18 million bpd of Opec supply, leaving little room for countries such as Iran, Libya and Iraq to increase their output. \u201cPeople in Opec are fed up with the Saudi policy of overproducing since November and have lost a lot of revenue because of this.\u201d Tensions within the group have risen further since Iran sealed a historic nuclear deal with world powers, which could lead to potentially more Iranian crude entering an already oversupplied market. Iran's production has been severely curtailed by sanctions and is currently around 2.7 million bpd, but Iran was capable of pumping over 4 million bpd in 2011.  Saudi and its close Gulf allies are unlikely to change their strategy of keeping production at current levels. In doing so they are causing rifts to emerge within Opec. \"Individual quotas need to be restored,\" said the source, who added that Saudi Arabia's aim of pegging back shale oil production in the US had failed. Brent crude tumbled to a new six-year low of $46 per barrel after the US government downgraded its short-term forecast for prices. Opec member revenues fell below $1 trillion last year and that figures is expected to fall further in 2015, with oil prices expected to average around $49 per barrel, according to the Energy Information Administration. Opec and officials in Saudia Arabia did not respond to requests for comment.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:   Venezuela is in desperate financial trouble and Iran legitimately wants to increase production, so I think there will be some change that will involve changes in quotas for individual countries.
