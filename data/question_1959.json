There's no doubt that Coinbase has a relatively small source of revenue streams albeit their intention for 2021 and ahead is extend the revenue streams from subscriptions (See Alesia Haas, Chief Financial Officer @ +/- 2:20 on https://bit.ly/3sYieEc) Q1 2021 estimate results were released  on 6/4/21 and beat total 2020 with revenues @ $1.8bn and net $730m - $800m (see https://bit.ly/322QVNp) On the release of the Q1 2021 the forward looking statement is interesting in that it references the volatility of crypto and BTC; see https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_downloads/Q1'21-Coinbase-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf Current futures are asking around $525 (https://bit.ly/3mJgPiQ). If the reference price is 20% - 30% lower, that creates a vlauation around $100bn - $120bn Another comment of a few days ago estimates a valuation of $70bn-$90n (https://bit.ly/3a2npf3). IMHO, as long as BTC stays above $55k and ETH / ETH2 stays above $2k and the institutions continue to show interest in crypto , I'd expect a valuation of $100bn - $150bn. However, as I have said previously, with the 114.9m shares being listed by current shareholders, it all depends on how many are actually planning on selling on the 14th April. @SE_Meyer I see you have targeted a 'reference' or opening price of $500 and hence have increased your No 4 bucket too.

Confirmed by Coinbase at https://bit.ly/31Nwp2Z. For more info, see https://bit.ly/2OgqvV3 for the SEC listing. Jesse Powell of Kraken is very positive about Coinbase's direct listing (https://bloom.bg/3mgDbYs) and is planning a listing of Kraken in 2022. Powell also expects Coinbase to be valued at $100bn 'with a pop after that'.  Apropos Coinbase, as it is a direct listing, no new capital will be raised, no new shares will be issued, no intermediaries are involved and only current shareholders can sell shares as there is no lockup period. So, in reality, the price of a share at listing is determined by supply and demand and the 'reference price'. The reference rice is usually determined by the company's adviser and internal transactions. See the section about IOP v DLP here https://bit.ly/3sN4b4z. Looking at Coinbase's Mission Statement (https://bit.ly/3sNXHSR ) and the first paragraph of the company's website; \"We are building the cryptoeconomy \u2013 a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system enabled by crypto.\" and what is often held the views about the traditional financial structures and markets in the crypto sphere, it is not surprising that Coinbase has chosen the DLP route.  Coinbase will list 114.85m Class A shares at a maximum aggregate offering of $943m according to the SEC listing (https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001679788/cbfab060-8271-48dc-a12e-54b7416a71f9.pdf). Secondary private Nasdeq dealings a couple of months ago suggested the company would be worth $100bn at listing (https://bit.ly/2QjwxVH).  Bearing in mind the following:\ni) The current 'boom' in crypto prices\nii) Coinbase earns fees from both transactions and subscriptions and storage, fees will rise as traded asset prices rise\niii) the company generated revenues of $1.3bn in 2020 and $527m (EBITA) (see Our Business Model by Alicia Haas at https://bit.ly/3sYieEc)\niv) continued acceptance of crypto and investment into by institutions\nv) the company held $130m in BTC at Dec 2020 and $23.8m in ETR and $34m (+/- $188m) in internal HODL crypto\nvi) the listing is less than 2 weeks away and there are now apparent cracks in the crypto world's prices It is feasible that company's A Class shares will trade on the 14th April in the upper estimates and value the company $120bn - $150bn.
