As the former chief executive of ExxonMobil, which has vast business interests in Russia, Mr. Tillerson may once have had an excellent rapport with Mr. Putin, but his hands are tied. \"Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements about NATO \u2014 Russia\u2019s perceived nemesis \u2014 have flipped from calling alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d to vowing support for it. \"Finally, out the window go the Russian dreams of a Trump-Putin alliance expected to reshuffle the world order wherein might makes right \u2014 the dreams that made the Russian parliament break into applause upon news of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. \"Busted expectations are a bad foundation for negotiations. In Mr. Putin\u2019s case, they will make him less likely to believe any U.S. promises, even if they come from the Order of Friendship holder.  In all likelihood, Mr. Tillerson understands that a breakthrough is not feasible and undertakes that visit simply on orders from Mr. Trump.  The latter seeks to appease the increasingly aggressive Mr. Putin, who has been testing him lately.\n. . . \n\"The only way to successfully negotiate with Mr. Putin is to talk to him from a position of strength. That is best achieved by strengthening our military, political, and economic alliances, notably by standing by the recent promise to support NATO.

A bipartisan group of 18 senators has introduced legislation establishing congressional oversight of Russia sanctions relief through The Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017, S. 341, which requires that before sanctions relief can be granted the Administration has to submit to Congress certification that the Russian Federation has ceased specific actions in the Ukraine.
