Easily comparable to ts4 and @dglid has done the analysis on view count. But what I'm more interested in is early sentiment indicators. Ts4 trailer 1 has 56 million views on the main trailer with 1 million likes.\nTs4 trailer 2 has 22 million views and 248k likes. Frozen 2 trailer 1 has 81 million views and 846k likes.\nThe second trailer has 15 million views and 276k likes. Its still early and those view counts will likely go up by 20% up until release date so i'd say sentiment for frozen is higher by about 10% and it seems to be attracting a larger audience based on view stats. Which is more than backed up by franchise comparison on google trends -> https://prnt.sc/pj7jig\nWhen comparing with Lion king things get even more interesting https://prnt.sc/pj7ntv\nDecided to compare to Hunger games catching fire since that was mentioned which currently has the highest opening weekend for a November release and racked up $222 Million for it's opening week https://prnt.sc/pj7ryg Note that Hunger games opened on the same day (Nov 22nd) and it was unaffected by Thanks Giving. I haven't done any of my fairy land maths yet but considering ts4 made 178 Mil in its opening week and Lion King being a comparable franchise (admittedly not as old but we're going by search results here) made 275 Mil .... I think we're looking north of Toy story and possibly even Hunger games, but lower than Lion King (these are my boundaries)... I'd actually expect something around the 210 mark. But given most of the numbers on these family friendly franchises are safely above the 175 Mil mark, it kind of makes it easy to write those lower brackets out. If I'm going to change this projection it's likely going to be up... What's holding me at 70% for the top bracket is this lingering feeling that it's a crummy sequel... (Just like Toy story 4!)

My original projection for Once Upon a Time In Hollywood was $71.6MM [4]. My final projection was $52.7MM [5]. Final result was $58.8MM. I was worse than the crowd, with an accuracy score of 0.078. My original projection for Joker was $99.9MM [6]. My final projection was $105.0MM [7]. Final result was $137.8MM. I was better than the crowd, with an accuracy score of -0.008. Find my model for Frozen 2 here [1]. My opening weekend, seasonality-adjusted projection based on trailer views is $179.1MM, which is projecting a significantly bigger take than the top range of BoxOfficePro's long range forecast of $115-145MM [8]. I use the average of my trailer-based prediction and BoxOfficePro's long range forecast to get a $154.6MM projected opening weekend. Extrapolate that out for the entire week and I end up with a mean of $195.8MM. I calculate a standard deviation by averaging the typical variation of BoxOfficeReport's predictions [9] of similar movies (within 10% of projected mean either way) to actual results. I will update my projection ~weekly with new trailer numbers and average BoxOfficeReport's final prediction expected November 22th, at which point I'll remove BoxOfficePro's long range forecast from my final average. In conclusion: Forecasted mean: $195,765,156\nStandard deviation: $32,434,371 Model: 1%, 7%, 18%, 29%, 45%\nCrowd: 56%, 15%, 8%, 13%, 8% P.s. Model updates: I made two changes to the model this time around, one significant and one insignificant:\n1. Significant change: After running the model the first time, I got a forecast of well over $200k. This seemed due to the inclusion of trailer data for non-blockbuster movies which was skewing the data upward. To address this, I've limited the baseline data for projecting revenue by trailer counts to only movies within 10% of BoxOfficePro's long-range forecast of Frozen 2. This puts Frozen 2 in the company of Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel, Jurassic World, Deadpool 2,Thor: Ragnarok, IT, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. \n2. Insignificant change: I updated the standard deviation to match the same bucket of comps as in #1.
