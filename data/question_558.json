So let's look at these 1 by 1: \"Sharara (oilfield) recently reached output of 280,000 barrels per day, but closed this week due to a pipeline blockade. Its production is key to Libya\u2019s oil output, which surged above 1-million barrels per day in late June.\" https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/markets/2017-08-23-price-of-oil-slumps-on-rising-production-in-libya/ Understanding that we are looking at a base of 1001 a day for June/July we need to look at whether OPEC will be successful in forcing a production cut, whether Sharara stays open, and how much Wintershall will be able to help ramp up production.  Sharara has shut down a couple times this year already for time periods from about 2 weeks to about 3 days. Last year it shut down for about 10 months. Looking at  this helped me discover \"oil Twitter.\" The situation here remains volatile & this will have to be followed really every couple of days since it'll be a major factor in which category wins out.  I expect to change my initial prediction here a few times based on the volatility of the local situation there.  OPEC has exempted Libya from cuts, according to Reuters: \"Libya has been exempted from an OPEC-led push to cut global production and bolster oil prices, and the recovery of the North African country\u2019s output has complicated the bloc\u2019s efforts to curb supply. But the renewed problems at Sharara show how fragile the gains remain, vulnerable to security challenges, local protests, political splits, and shortfalls in the NOC\u2019s maintenance and investment budget.\" https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL8N1L8366 So let's see what's up with Wintershall's activity (https://www.wintershall.com/worldwide/libya.html). Now Wintershall & Libya have been at odds over production & payment in the recent past (https://www.ft.com/content/e7eed8f8-35a7-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e). Nonetheless they seem to have kissed and made up currently. This has caused the Libyan oil chief to predict: \u201cWe are able to produce an average of 1.1m to 1.2m [barrels a day] over the rest of this year but for this to happen our oil must flow freely.
