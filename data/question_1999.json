By April 15, 125.8M people had been reported to have received at least one dose, and by April 29, 143.8M had. So, likely no more than 143.8M + 23.8M = 167.6M, and probably closer to a max of (125.8M + 143.8M)/2 + 23.8M = 158.6M. So, the maximum number of people who will likely get vaccinated in the near-ish future is probably 158.6M to 167.6M (age 16+) + 5M (age 12-15) = 163.6M to 172.6M. I suspect the true near-term max is closer to 164M even with kids. Update 5/8: 0.73M/day added in past week. Taking that as a maximum, with 26 more forecast days (including 3 days for back reporting, we get to 151.3M (May 8 total) + 0.73M * 26 = 170.28. But we'll be adding much less than that soon, except for kids.

The most easily or keen to be vaccinated have been done.  Clarity on who is eligible when seems poor and inconsistent.  Large vaccination centres suggest few and far between so travel needed to access (in comparison to uk which is numerous and local).  There also seems to be some supply issues versus demand, and then there is the question of reduction in confidence after the J&J pause.  Even if that\u2019s not a real problem, has the perception caused lower keenness?\nThe Bloomberg article also talks about warmer weather (not here though), being able to be outside and spring summer suppression reducing perception of urgency.

If one projects that decline linearly out to May 31, only about 85k people/day would be receiving vaccines. However, children age 12-15 will be eligible to take the vaccine starting as early as next week. That will add a pool of almost 17M people eligible to take the vaccine, of which up to ~70% or ~12M may get the vaccine. On the other hand, vaccine hesitancy is strongest among young adults. 148.6M to date. 6.1M more people received at least one vaccine dose in the past week, or 0.87M/day. Forecasting that outward 29 days gets to 174M. But the reality will not be linear. Upshot: I think adult vaccinations are winding down rapidly. Children may provide a boost of 5M to 12M at most in the forecast period. My guess is that somewhere in the ballpark of 14M adults will be added and ~4M to 7M children will be added, for a total of 149M + 14M + 6M = 169M, right on the line between bins. I'll weight the lower category higher, because adult vaccination might fall off much faster, and fewer children than that may get vaccinated because the perceived risk to children is low (despite long Covid)."], [57249, "2021-05-06T00:09:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [81567, "2021-05-05T21:47:48Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-05-05T20:53:51Z", [0.88, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80790, "2021-05-05T20:41:32Z", [0.12, 0.84, 0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "148.8m today.

Based on polls I'm skeptical it gets close to that high in the coming month. There are a lot of people who are \"wait and see\" on the polls, and while some of them may be convinced I think that'll be a long term process over the summer, maybe convincing half or so of those people. According to the poll linked below 62% of people have gotten it or will get it ASAP. But if Pfizer opens up 12 to 16 year olds for vaccination which may happen in the next week or two that could increase vaccination rates. According to the second link there are around 25 million kids ages 12 to 17. If half of those get it that could add around 12 million vaccinations in the long term, and maybe the optimistic case is half of those get their first dose this month. Overall I think the most optimistic case possible would be doing a million new vaccinations a day, which would put it at 180 million.
