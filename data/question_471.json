For starters, there are only about two months left in 2018 and based on weekly reports by the CDC \"Influenza activity in the United States remains low.\" As of now, there has only been one pediatric death that was associated with influenza.  Based off of this, it can be assumed that influenza activity will stay low for the next few weeks at least.  Moreover, at the very beginning of 2018, the CDC reported widespread virus activity for the first time in 13 years. Even with these record breaking numbers WHO and the CDC did not suggest a pandemic. This shows that even with higher rates of influenza, it is unlikely there will be a pandemic. Lastly, since 1889, there have only been five pandemics total, with the shortest gap between outbreaks being 11 years and the overall average being one outbreak every 25 years.

At the time, they didn\u2019t know that,\u201d says Dr. Jernigan. In addition to new information about and understanding of influenza viruses themselves, we also have new medical advancements in how we treat influenza and influenza-related complications. \u201cWe have antiviral drugs that can target the virus itself. We have ventilators and intensive care units. We have vaccines. We have so much more capability now,\u201d adds Dr. Jernigan. While significant advancement has been made in flu prevention, other modern developments may contribute to the impact of a pandemic today. The world is more crowded and the worlds of humans and animals continue to converge, both factors that promote the emergence of novel influenza viruses, Dr. Jernigan says. Because most influenza viruses that cause pandemics start in the animal population, improving avian and swine influenza surveillance is very important. Everyday work in the Influenza Division centers around the study of seasonal influenza and novel influenza viruses that have pandemic potential, notes Dr. Jernigan. \u201cViruses are constantly changing, so that means we have to constantly monitor them. They have minor little changes that can occur throughout the year and so you have to look at them every month, even every week.\u201d  Because influenza viruses are constantly changing and the risk of pandemic influenza is imminent we must continue to expand our understanding of influenza viruses. . . . \u201cA big challenge is vaccine \u2014 our flu vaccines take a long time to make and they have to be made to target specific viruses.  Immunity from vaccination wanes over time so people need to be revaccinated annually,\u201d Dr. Jernigan says. \u201cWe need flu vaccines that can be made more quickly, that offer longer lasting protection, and that protect against many different flu viruses. What would be wonderful would be to develop a universal vaccine that would protect against all flu viruses. But in the interim, we can make better vaccines.\u201d The systems that we use for seasonal influenza; virus surveillance, vaccine manufacturing, and vaccine development, are the foundation of our response to the next flu pandemic.  They all need to continue improving so if we have another bad pandemic like the one in 1918, we will be much more prepared and better protected.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The northern hemisphere is emerging from flu season while the southern hemisphere is entering it.  Given that about 88% of the world's population lives in the northern hemisphere, the probability of a pandemic emerging from the southern hemisphere is less.  Considering that the flu season peaks between Dec & Feb in the northern hemisphere, according to the CDC, I'd say that the chances of a pandemic emerging in the next 8 months is very low.  @Ken_Barns & @ErikFritzsche:  is my logic off, here?"], [691, "2018-04-19T15:07:14Z", [0.01], ""], [57555, "2018-04-18T09:47:37Z", [0.05], ""], [57849, "2018-04-17T08:40:31Z", [0.1], ""], [172, "2018-04-16T22:32:27Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-04-16T20:39:57Z", [0.01], ""], [12591, "2018-04-15T05:46:46Z", [0.1], ""], [1034, "2018-04-14T17:34:38Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-04-13T02:25:07Z", [0.02], ""], [29054, "2018-04-12T23:29:44Z", [0.0], ""], [43003, "2018-04-12T00:45:48Z", [0.04], ""], [1034, "2018-04-10T16:34:59Z", [0.0], ""], [11759, "2018-04-10T12:21:03Z", [0.02], "- Five influenza pandemics since 1900, nine during the last 300 years\n- WHO declares a pandemic if a new strain reaches stage 6 on the WHO 6-stages scale, meaning confirmed human to human infections in at least three countries in 2 WHO regions\n- The current H3N2 subtype is considered dangerous, but not mutated enough to be considered a new strain\n- The activity in the northern hemisphere is decreasing, except for east europe, in the southern hemisphere they are  at inter-seasonal levels\nhttp://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2018_04_02_surveillance_update_312.pdf\n"], [41922, "2018-04-09T23:34:08Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-04-09T17:10:12Z", [0.09], ""], [691, "2018-04-09T12:29:18Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2018-04-08T22:50:04Z", [0.0], ""], [56997, "2018-04-07T16:55:46Z", [0.12], ""], [57670, "2018-04-06T23:59:36Z", [0.02], ""], [13966, "2018-04-06T23:09:12Z", [0.05], ""], [55316, "2018-04-06T04:12:32Z", [0.02], ""], [172, "2018-04-06T00:29:31Z", [0.05], ""], [1646, "2018-04-04T11:17:32Z", [0.05], "\u201cIt\u2019s probably unusual to have this much flu, this late.

Also of importance, a discussion with an Infectious Diseases physician friend of mine, especially about the 2009 pandemic. In short, the risk of a pandemic in the next 12 months is no greater than it has been in the last few years (ie. no particularly ominous clouds on the horizon, just the ongoing threat assessments).  However, when an influenza pandemic eventually occurs, it is likely to come out of nowhere, going from Phase 3 (a few extra case reports) to Phase 5 (an impending phase 6 pandemic) within a few weeks.  From that point of view, we probably can't do much better than using baseline risk to predict. And with 5 pandemics in the last 100 years, and 4 in the last 60 years, that baseline risk is in the realm of about 5-7% annually, or about 0.5% per month.  Is there any reason to vary widely from that baseline? Increased travel in modern times?\nA pandemic is more likely to wash over the world more quickly, but I don't think that makes a pandemic any more likely.  It just means that there will be near-simultaneous outbreaks everywhere, rather than the slow-motion waves of cases that were seen over 2-3 years with the 1918-1920 Spanish Flu. Better surveillance?\nEarly adaptation of public health measures might decrease (slightly) transmission in prepared populations, and might result in resource allocation that saves lives.  I can't see it making much of a difference preventing a pandemic occurring though.  (Speaking from my own experience as a primacy care physician here.)  Similarly, we might be in a better position to develop vaccines and treatments more promptly, but once again, this won't prevent the pandemic occurring. Increased population?\nI think increased pig and chicken populations to act as incubators for new strains of influenza are balanced out by virological monitoring of those populations, and willingness in most (but not all) parts of the world to intervene decisively as something appears to be brewing.

Assumptions:\nBasic reproduction number (R0) of a pandemic H7N9 would be ~1.7\nConfirmed poultry-to-human cases in China will follow the increasing trend of previous waves and the similar duration. I estimate that there will be approximately 700 poultry-to-human cases (650-950) or lower, if the poultry vaccination program in China is successful, for the remainder of 2017 and 2018.\nThe high case fatality rate of H7N9 in humans is unlikely to substantially curtail the R0 enough to prevent a pandemic due to peak viral shedding preceding the onset of symptoms or the case fatality rate of the H7N9-derived pandemic will decrease upon adaptation to facilitate spread.\nThe H7 viral protein will have a similar preference for the alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptors over the alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors as other avian influenza viruses. Other considerations going into this estimate include:\nThe close proximity of the previous cases in the Western Pacific WHO region to the Europe and SE Asia WHO regions.\nThe absence of an obvious mixing vessel for reassortment.\nConfirmed case of human-to-human transmission of the virus.\nThe diversification of the H7N9 virus since 2013.\nThe length of the influenza season in the region.\nThe score from the Centers for Disease Control's Influenza Risk Assessment Tool.

However, it seems that the effectiveness of flu immunization might decrease with repeated immunizations (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21022).  During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 Dr. Dr. Danuta Skowronski from UBC found that people who were immunized had almost twice the risk of getting H1N1.  The findings have been reported in academic journals and by the Canadian Broadcasting Company.   http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-vaccine-paradox-adds-to-public-health-debate-1.2912790  Many people have been immunized repeatedly. There is not yet a technology to assure that the flu immunizations of a particular year will necessarily provide protection against the current years flu.   There are economic incentives to detect a flu epidemic and promote further vaccines. Industry and government are try to gather support to develop and implement a single shot vaccine. The projection is based on the idea that overall flu resistance will decline in people who have had repeated flu immunizations, and the incentives to detect an epidemic. I do not know of any evidence suggesting that the decreased resistance with increased immunizations applies to other vaccines.  Although I accept that repeated flu vaccines might be associated with increased risk, it is important to know that the evidence for this conclusion is not strong.\n"], [1034, "2017-07-02T07:11:08Z", [0.0], ""], [36269, "2017-07-02T04:24:40Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-07-01T15:48:34Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2017-07-01T06:06:24Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-30T14:19:31Z", [0.01], ""], [29469, "2017-06-30T08:30:03Z", [0.15], "At least now there is a market view on the probability of this https://www.ft.com/content/487b0d00-5c26-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220"], [1034, "2017-06-30T06:48:28Z", [0.0], ""], [29680, "2017-06-29T23:58:40Z", [0.15], ""], [30330, "2017-06-29T19:36:15Z", [0.3], ""], [691, "2017-06-29T19:34:54Z", [0.01], ""], [12983, "2017-06-29T17:55:05Z", [0.65], ""], [1034, "2017-06-29T07:43:51Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2017-06-28T05:35:17Z", [0.0], ""], [30594, "2017-06-27T19:45:25Z", [0.09], "Pandemics are 'chaotic systems': they behave non-linear (exponential growth of cases) and dynamic (the output of one stage influences its future pathway)(cf.

Are there reasons to assume that CDC or WHO will be careful in declaring an influenza pandemic?\n- One should distinguish between the case as such, an influenza pandemic, and the declaration of the pandemic by an organization like WHO or CDC - as one should distinguish the case of a famine in Nigeria and its declaration by the UN FAO (cf.: https://www.gjopen.com/questions/464-will-the-un-declare-a-famine-in-any-part-of-nigeria-in-2017).

Silver, 2013, The Signal and the Noise, Chapter 7)\u2026 but Silver also discusses self-canceling effects of predicting pandemics - which would, paradoxically, indicate success of declaring pandemics. In essence, it seems not possible to have an 'inside view' with a gain of knowledge. That is the lesson of Nate Silvers' Chapter on predicting pandemics.
