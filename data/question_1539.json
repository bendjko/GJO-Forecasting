Arce is the continuity candidate. There is more support for breaking with the past, but it is spread among several candidates. Arce is on about 30% right now. \u00c1\u00f1ez and Camacho combined have slightly more support than Arce. Some assumptions I will make, based on the electoral system and current polls rather than knowledge of the country:\n- Nobody will win the first round outright\n- The runoff will be between Arce and another candidate According to the most recent poll info I could find (https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20200223/mesa-anez-se-imponen-arce-segunda-vuelta, in Spanish) Arce would lose to \u00c1\u00f1ez or Mesa but would beat Camacho.\nSo the key question is who comes second to Arce in the first round. If we assume Arce wins the first round and use it as a poll for who comes second, we get \u00c1\u00f1ez on 37%, Mesa on 39% and Camacho on 24%. And if we assume Arce would beat Camacho while the other two would beat Arce, that gives us \u00c1\u00f1ez on 37% to win, Arce on 24%, Mesa on 39% and Camacho on zero. Since that is clearly a rather simplistic model (the polls can change, and it doesn't seem right to rule out a major candidate entirely) I have reallocated a few points from the others to Camacho, and other outcomes. There have been debates about whether some of the anti-Arce candidates should even be standing, so it's possible there may be withdrawals, which the model doesn't factor in. So I will keep watching this space.\n"], [38094, "2020-02-28T02:12:26Z", [0.45, 0.45, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "Recognizing that I don't have a clue, I'll temper my forecast until I learn more."], [20156, "2020-02-27T17:09:21Z", [0.15, 0.6, 0.1, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [84644, "2020-02-27T14:56:55Z", [0.25, 0.65, 0.05, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [37236, "2020-02-27T09:39:20Z", [0.22, 0.3, 0.28, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [85698, "2020-02-26T23:36:03Z", [0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.0], "Close race"], [60747, "2020-02-26T21:32:46Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.15, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [60747, "2020-02-26T21:30:31Z", [0.35, 0.35, 0.05, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [34407, "2020-02-26T21:26:55Z", [0.39, 0.19, 0.09, 0.09, 0.24], ""], [8826, "2020-02-26T21:19:17Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [1333, "2020-02-26T15:32:53Z", [0.2, 0.26, 0.25, 0.15, 0.14], ""], [19127, "2020-02-26T10:22:32Z", [0.36, 0.46, 0.04, 0.03, 0.11], ""], [81300, "2020-02-26T00:15:35Z", [0.26, 0.49, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75794, "2020-02-25T23:28:45Z", [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [52778, "2020-02-25T21:42:40Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.15, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-02-25T14:47:38Z", [0.2, 0.39, 0.2, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-02-25T11:57:19Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15], ""], [726, "2020-02-25T00:29:18Z", [0.15, 0.71, 0.06, 0.06, 0.02], "Updating forecast for the \"Someone else or another outcome\" as I can't justify a 0% forecast under Cromwell's Rule :)."], [726, "2020-02-24T23:31:37Z", [0.15, 0.71, 0.07, 0.07, 0.0], "I don't believe that many people are happy with Jeanine Anez and her running in this election.
