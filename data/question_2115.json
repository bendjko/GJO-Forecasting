They'll go through at least one more revision, perhaps ending up between 115k and 135k, but probably somewhere in the middle. But more importantly, next week's TEUs aren't going up yet. Usually by now, the port has some wild forecast that the next week will see 50% more TEUs imported than the same week last year.

Their numbers for Week 48 are undoubtedly low right now, but higher numbers would add <~10k to the Nov 21 total, to reach 890k. It's close, but bin 2 is very possible. There is massive uncertainty in these relative percentages, but there is a real risk of bin 2, and I think that with next week's forecast so low, bin 4 is really unlikely right now.

I had predicted that the the Oct 21 number would be \"probably at ~94%-95% of Oct 2020 but possibly lower,\" so I wasn't too far off. So this gives me more confidence in predicting the November number based on using the 2021 Port Signal data relative to 2020 data in the same publication: https://signal.portoptimizer.com/ Also, note that October total exported TEUs were 92.6% of total imported TEUs, in line with September's 92%. One crude estimate for Nov 2021 is this: because Oct 2020 was 27% above Oct 2019, a higher percentage than for any other month in 2020, and Nov 2020 was 22% higher than Nov 2019, I'd predict that all else equal, Nov 2021 would come in at around 100% - (22/27)*7.96% = ~93.5% (+/-2%) of Nov 2020 = 0.93 * 890k = 828k. But the Port Optimizer import data (which should be used only for relative comparisons not absolute values) suggest the possibility that Nov could end up higher. Week 44 in 2021 came in about 26% over week 44 in 2020; that 26% should be interpreted with giant error bars. Week 45 came in ~3% lower. Week 46 still shows some possibility for coming in above 2020, possibly substantially. Week 47 is currently slated for a large decrease, but that could change. And it's too early to say anything about the first 2 days of Week 48. Barring disaster, bin 1 is out thanks to week 44. For weeks 44 and 45, 2020 added up to 219k, and 2021 added up to 239k, or 9% more than 2020. Week 46 is still looking very good on Thursday evening, likely won't come out below 2020 and could well end up substantially higher. However, because of Week 47's very low projected number, I don't rule out bin 3 yet. Everything will be much clearer by Sunday night, when they post their gigantic overestimate for the coming week.

But it adjusted down again and is now only 1.78% higher than last year this week. I bet it will be adjusted even lower tomorrow and again after the week is over. The pattern is clear: 9 out of 11 of the past weeks have seen TEU volumes lower than last year. I had hoped that the current focus on the port might mean things would take off, but they do not seem to have the leadership and/or powers they need to clear the backlog. So I suspect that Nov 21 will be below Nov 20, or at most about 2% greater. And then the question is how low. Oct 21 is likely to be 82% of Oct 20. Oct 20 was 27% above Oct 19, and Nov 20 was 22% above Nov 19, so I suspect Nov 21 won't be as low as 82% of Nov 20. But it could easily be 90% of Nov 20, right on the lines between bins 1 and 2. I'll see how this week's TEUs come in and adjust from there. It's looking most likely that Nov 21 will be ~95% of Nov 20.\nFurther info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1350451 Also, I looked more into export TEUs as a fraction of import TEUs. For all of 2020, export TEUs were 89% of import TEUs. For 2021, total export TEUs through September have been 91% of total import TEUs. For each individual month in 2021, exported TEUs have also averaged 91% (range, 87% to 95%) of imported TEUs. For September, exported TEUs were 92% of imported TEUs. In August, it was 95%; August is also the only month in 2021 in which total TEUs was less than for the same month in 2020. So I think it's reasonable to expect that October and November export TEUs will be in the range of 87% to 95% of import TEUs, and probably about 91% or 92%. Let A = Nov 2021 imports as a fraction of Nov 2020 imports, and B = Nov 2021 exports as a fraction of Nov 2021 imports. Nov 2020 import TEUs were 466k. Then\nNov 2021 total TEUs = 466k * A * (1+B).\nMinimum: 466k * 0.82 * 1.85 = 707k\nMore reasonable: 466k * 0.90 * 1.91 = 801k\nAlso reasonable: 466k * 0.95 * 1.95 = 863k\nHigher end of likely imo: 466k * 0.95 * 1.92 = 850k\nLess likely: 466k * 0.98 * 1.92 = 877k\nLess likely: 466k * 0.99 * 1.95 = 900k\nLess likely: 466k * 1.00 * 1.93 = 900k\nAlso less likely: 466k * 1.01 * 1.91 = 900k (So imports would have to be at or above 2020 levels, and exports at or above average as % of imports, to reach 900k.)\nAn upper limit: 466k * 1.00 * 1.95 = 908.7k\nLess likely upper limit: 466k * 1.025 * 1.95 = 931k (where Nov 21 imports are 2.5% greater than Nov 20 imports, and exports are 95% of imports)\nUnreasonable upper limit: 466k * 1.05 * 1.95 = 954k (where Nov 21 imports are 5% greater than Nov 20 imports, and exports are 95% of imports)\nExtreme upper limit: 466k * 1.10 * 1.95 = 999.57 (where Nov 21 imports are 10% greater than Nov 20 imports, and exports are 95% of imports) Operations would need to change drastically for Nov 21 imports to be >5% greater than Nov 20 imports.\nIf Nov 21 imports are 1% lower than Nov 20 imports, then if exports are 95% of imports, total TEUs would reach 900k.\nIf Nov 21 imports are lower than Nov 20 imports by >1%, then bin 3 is extremely unlikely (as exports would need to be >95% of imports, and that has not been seen in 2021).\nIf Nov 21 imports are <90% of Nov 20 imports, then bin 1 is very likely.\nLet's see how week 44 goes."], [96828, "2021-11-04T12:59:16Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [102675, "2021-11-04T00:28:29Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.5], ""], [86367, "2021-11-04T00:25:17Z", [0.0, 0.27, 0.55, 0.18], ""], [97312, "2021-11-03T19:57:25Z", [0.01, 0.16, 0.58, 0.25], ""], [55987, "2021-11-03T15:18:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.41, 0.59], ""], [102607, "2021-11-03T15:12:18Z", [0.03, 0.09, 0.63, 0.25], "Total TEUs \nJanuary 835,516.20 \nFebruary 799,315.40 \nMarch 957,599.25 \nApril 946,966.35 \nMay 1,012,047.85 \nJune 876,430.35 \nJuly 890,799.80 \nAugust 954,377.35 \nSeptember 903,864.60 Only one month in the previous year has the rate dropped below 800k.

So I'll make a ballpark estimate that Oct will see 0.91 * 421k = 383k exported TEUs.\nThen my estimated total for October 2021 is approx 421k imported TEUs + 383k exported TEUs = 804k TEUs.\nOctober 2020 saw 981k total TEUs, with 511k imports and 470k exports, so it looks like October 2021 will be substantially lower than October 2020. This is not surprising, as October 2020 saw a total 27% over the Oct 2019 total. The one caveat could be that the import totals I'm seeing for each week may be *loaded* containers, not empty. This shouldn't be a problem, though, as empty containers averaged about 1% of total imports in 2020. But empty containers averaged about 65% of total exports. So, as ships aren't getting loaded with as many empties as desired these days, export totals may fall below 91% of import totals. The portoptimizer website shows a comparison with the past 3 years, too. Since week 33 (inclusive), 2021 imported TEUs have been less than 2020 TEUs 9 weeks and above 2020 TEUs 2 weeks (weeks 37 and 41). Week 41 in 2020 was 131913 TEUs.\nBut their forecasts fluctuate enormously, change more than daily, and seem to be wildly overoptimistic. Barring major changes in operations, I suspect the Nov 2021 total will likely fall below the Nov 2020 total of 890k, because:\n1. Weekly totals are mostly below 2020 totals lately.\n2. Nov 2020 was 22% over Nov 2019, and it's hard to beat that. Aug and Sept 2021 were -0.78% and 2.29% of 2020 levels, respectively, and those months were 12% and 13% above their 2019 totals, respectively.\n3. Empties aren't being loaded onto ships as much as they'd like to, and that will decrease export TEU totals.\n4. While the port is processing record numbers of TEUs, it's also very bunged up, and not much seems to be changing very quickly. If Nov 2021 is 82% of Nov 2020, that would put it at 730k TEUs. I think that is a likely lower limit.\n90% of Nov 2020 => 801k. I think Nov 2021 is likely to come in at about 90% of Nov 2020, and that forecast is right on the edge between bins. We can watch the imported TEUs as they come in over the month of Nov, but the exports will be the big unknown. It'll be good to see what percentage of October imports the October exports come in at.

So I assign some substantial weight to bin 1, but less than I would if there weren't a lot of effort being put into moving containers faster. It would take a 12% yoy increase for Nov 2021 to end up >1M. That would be on top of last year's 22% yoy increase. I'm not sure I see that happening without drastic changes, including going 24/7. Looking at the ship numbers, my feeling is that Oct 2021 will reflect a slight decline yoy from Oct 2020. (I'd actually assign some serious weight to a prediction that Oct 2021 numbers will be lower than Sep 2021.) I'm not sure they'll be able to radically alter operations in November, given that they haven't been able to so far. But they might be able to.

Hopefully, the ports can get moving more quickly soon. Demand for imports has been rising throughout the pandemic, and Christmas is coming up, so I'll estimate that this Nov will want to welcome more cargo ships than last year. The backlog of ships to unload will dominate the situation, though, both in raw numbers and in the effects of the backlog on operations. 1654 vessels of all types, including 34 cruise ships, arrived at the port of LA in 2020. If ~40 container ships are currently waiting to unload in LA (60% of 80 currently waiting cargo ships (not all of which are container ships) seem to be destined for LA) and roughly 4/5 of all arriving vessels are container ships, then those 40 waiting ships would represent roughly 35% to 40% of monthly container ship arrivals. So this question will really be dominated by how much of that backlog can get cleared - or whether it gets worse.\nhttps://www.portoflosangeles.org/business/statistics/facts-and-figures 6 days ago, the Flexport CEO tweeted out a long thread about why the ports are clogged: https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1451543776992845834\n(also mentioned by @Foci and @MurphAC130 below). He also tweeted another useful thread a couple days before that: https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1450904056365404160. They're great reads for those interested. One bottleneck has been at least partially relieved since then, as Long Beach is now allowing truck yards to stack empty containers 4 to 5 high. But the situation has many complex causes, many problems remain, and there's not a simple fix. And now, the ports are imposing a $100 fine per container per day (increased by $100/day) to shippers if they don't clear cargo containers out of the ports in a timely fashion: https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/10/25/ports-of-los-angeles-long-beach-to-fine-companies-for-slow-container-movement/\nThis fine is presumably being imposed based on the theory that financial penalties will concentrate some fine minds into getting things moving; let's hope it works. What strikes me is that in spite of all the container ships waiting to unload at the ports, they've *still* been unloading more than last year each month except August, which fell <1% yoy, and 2020 was a record year. So even with all the problems, they're still getting more done than ever before. Here's a website where you can check vessel traffic: https://twitter.com/typesfast/status/1450904056365404160\nThe green dots are cargo vessels (not all of which are container ships...). I'm assigning some weight to bin 2 in case things at the port continue to get worse before they get better. Given how bunged up things are at the port right now, I think bin 3 is more likely than 4. Let's see how October goes.
