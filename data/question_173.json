Kim Jong-un\u2019s statement on Thursday suggests that the signaling value of the Musudan tests has been accomplished and, with a limited inventory of missiles remaining, Pyongyang may choose to hold off on further testing. Conversely, it could continue testing to protest international isolation and sanctions. The nightmare scenario is the possibility of Pyongyang using the know-how its gained with its Musudan testing to eventually conduct a flight test its KN-08 ICBM, with a possible atmospheric nuclear detonation to remove any doubts about miniaturization.\nHowever, amid attempts at an uneasy rapprochement with Beijing and even a willingness to enter a track 1.5 dialogue with regional and U.S. diplomats this week, Pyongyang may choose to tamp down its spate of testing somewhat and claim that its long-sought goal of credibly being able to threaten Guam with a nuclear strike has been achieved. With the country under economic stress from sanctions and under increased agricultural stress precipitating a famine, Kim has plenty of reason to turn his attention to the economic leg of byungjin.\" 38th North, June 23, 'A Partial Success for the Musudan': http://38north.org/2016/06/jschilling062316/\nClips from 38th North article:\n\"So we should probably assume they don\u2019t really care, that this was about propaganda and image rather than engineering and weapons development. They have achieved something that is as close to a win as possible without overflying Japan, and if they try again there\u2019s a good chance that Musudan #7 will be an embarrassing failure just like Musudan #5.\nBest case, they declare victory and go home, and make a quiet note to never actually trust the Musudan in wartime. Worst case, they tell their engineers to go back to their ground test facilities and turn this one-shot stunt into a useful weapon. The engineers in question would probably be quite happy to know they still have jobs, and turning the results from this spurt of unreasonably fast testing into a reliable weapon, would occupy them for a year or two at least. If they come back a year from now, testing Musudan missiles one at a time and with three to six months between tests, then we can start worrying about an operational Musudan.\" Comments: Five days left....... ironic that Kim Jong Un will be the ultimate factor of WHEN this system is deployed..... what side of the bed he gets up from, a fight with his wife, lukewarm Guk for lunch, stubbed toe, an attack of piles....

The military exercises themselves must convey SOME information to adversaries, right? Beyond that conveyed simply by the announcement of military exercises? In my original forecast [3] (to which I would welcome criticism) I mostly drew parallels between THAAD in SK and the precedent of THAAD in the United Arab Emirates; and googling I found that there were also military exercises in the UAE [4], roughly one year before a timeline for THAAD negotiations was even announced.

Despite the punishing measures, Pyongyang attempted several other missile launches, including one from a submarine. The trilateral defense drills will take place around June 28 on the sidelines of Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, international naval exercises in Hawaii, said South Korea\u2019s Ministry of National Defense. The exercises will focus on detecting and tracking missiles, not interception, although ships equipped with the Aegis ballistic missile defense system will be involved, said a ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.\" I conclude  that  prior statements about THAAD are the last we hear  until expiration of this IFP\nTHAAD by July no way.\nThis is the response.\nFor now.\n"], [368, "2016-05-16T21:33:46Z", [0.05], ""], [20872, "2016-05-16T21:06:51Z", [0.75], ""], [22243, "2016-05-16T19:41:43Z", [0.02], ""], [689, "2016-05-16T14:13:59Z", [0.12], ""], [876, "2016-05-16T12:49:53Z", [0.28], ""], [691, "2016-05-16T12:12:20Z", [0.21], ""], [4729, "2016-05-16T04:14:34Z", [0.6], ""], [1646, "2016-05-15T13:52:53Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-05-15T12:54:29Z", [0.21], ""], [12302, "2016-05-15T12:47:43Z", [0.18], ""], [20053, "2016-05-14T23:20:12Z", [0.02], ""], [16253, "2016-05-14T20:19:32Z", [0.27], ""], [368, "2016-05-14T17:28:42Z", [0.05], ""], [1639, "2016-05-14T16:08:06Z", [0.1], "Lowering for passing of time"], [484, "2016-05-14T15:59:59Z", [0.04], "Down 1%.

Zhang met in Seoul with South Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam to co-chair the seventh China-S. Korea high-level strategic dialogue between foreign ministries. The senior-level dialogue came after South Korea and the United States agreed to begin talks about deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in the South Korean territory in response to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s nuclear and missile threats. Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket, which some see as a test of banned ballistic missile technology, on Feb. 7 following its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6. Zhang told reporters after the meeting in Seoul that he exchanged views with Lim about the THAAD issue, among other issues, and said China expressed oppositions to the THAAD deployment. Zhang said China attaches great importance to ties with South Korea, and is ready to work along with the country to boost the sound development of bilateral relations, noting that China is firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which conforms to the common interests of China and South Korea. China opposes the DPRK's nuclear test and rocket launch, and supports a new and effective resolution at the UN Security Council, but sanctions are not an end in themselves, and a fundamental solution to the issue should be sought through dialogue and negotiations, Zhang said. The senior Chinese diplomat urged relevant parties to act prudently, in an apparent reference to Seoul and Washington that have agreed to launch talks about the THAAD deployment. China hopes relevant parties would show respect for China's interests and act with prudence, as the deployment is not conducive to easing the current tension and maintaining peace and stability in the region, but would impair China's strategic security interest, Zhang said. The THAAD, designed to track and destroy ballistic missiles at an altitude of 40 km to 150 km, has been put under suspicion about its operational effectiveness in South Korea as hundreds of shorter-range DPRK missiles can fly at a much lower altitude. There are also safety concerns as the THAAD X-band radar emits super-strong microwaves, allegedly harmful to human bodies within 3.6 km while paralyzing electronic devices and airplanes within 5.5 km. South Korean officials said the two sides had \"candid, in-depth, and constructive\" discussions on bilateral ties and the security conditions on the peninsula.

The two allies once again threatened to deploy Lockheed Martin's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system, which is designed to intercept ballistic missiles in midair, on Sunday, hours after the DPRK launched an Earth-observation satellite allegedly to test ballistic missile technology.\" SEOUL, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui on Tuesday expressed opposition to South Korea's plan to deploy a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system after a meeting here with his South Korean counterpart. Zhang met in Seoul with South Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Lim Sung-nam to co-chair the seventh China-S. Korea high-level strategic dialogue between foreign ministries. The senior-level dialogue came after South Korea and the United States agreed to begin talks about deploying the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in the South Korean territory in response to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s nuclear and missile threats. Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket, which some see as a test of banned ballistic missile technology, on Feb. 7 following its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6. Zhang told reporters after the meeting in Seoul that he exchanged views with Lim about the THAAD issue, among other issues, and said China expressed oppositions to the THAAD deployment. Zhang said China attaches great importance to ties with South Korea, and is ready to work along with the country to boost the sound development of bilateral relations, noting that China is firmly committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, which conforms to the common interests of China and South Korea. China opposes the DPRK's nuclear test and rocket launch, and supports a new and effective resolution at the UN Security Council, but sanctions are not an end in themselves, and a fundamental solution to the issue should be sought through dialogue and negotiations, Zhang said. The senior Chinese diplomat urged relevant parties to act prudently, in an apparent reference to Seoul and Washington that have agreed to launch talks about the THAAD deployment. China hopes relevant parties would show respect for China's interests and act with prudence, as the deployment is not conducive to easing the current tension and maintaining peace and stability in the region, but would impair China's strategic security interest, Zhang said. The THAAD, designed to track and destroy ballistic missiles at an altitude of 40 km to 150 km, has been put under suspicion about its operational effectiveness in South Korea as hundreds of shorter-range DPRK missiles can fly at a much lower altitude. There are also safety concerns as the THAAD X-band radar emits super-strong microwaves, allegedly harmful to human bodies within 3.6 km while paralyzing electronic devices and airplanes within 5.5 km. South Korean officials said the two sides had \"candid, in-depth, and constructive\" discussions on bilateral ties and the security conditions on the peninsula. South Korea attaches great importance to ties with China and is ready to work for their further development, and would maintain consultations and communications with China regarding the THAAD deployment issue, said the S.Korean officials.

The United States and South Korea earlier began talks on possible deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system after North Korea tested its fourth nuclear bomb on Jan. 6 and launched a long-range rocket on Feb. 7, but China firmly opposes the move.  Shin Beomchul, director-general for policy planning at South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry, told a seminar that more conversations were need with China on the issue.  \u201cI hope to ask China\u2019s understanding of what (South) Korea is feeling about the North Korean threat,\u201d he told the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  \u201cIt is not the usual threat, it is a nuclear threat. That\u2019s very serious. We are now in the live-or-die situation,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have to solve the \u2026 misunderstanding, but the fundamental point is that to protect our country is the top priority.\u201d\nUltimately, the way to resolve the controversy would be to decrease the North Korean threat, he added. Mark Lambert, director of the Office of Korean Affairs at the U.S. State Department, told the seminar Beijing was still refusing a U.S. offer of briefings to explain that the system was not aimed at limiting China\u2019s defense capabilities.\nSouth Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Hyoung-zhin stressed the need for all countries to put pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear program through full implementation of international and bilateral sanctions.\nHe said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s government did not look likely to give up nuclear weapons under any circumstances, but did respond to external stimuli.  \u201cIf these elements are tightly interwoven without any loophole \u2026 the Kim Jong Un regime will realize that it cannot survive unless it gives up its nuclear program and takes steps towards denuclearization,\u201d he said.  Lambert said U.S. experts wanted to explain that the THAAD system would not negate China\u2019s nuclear deterrent as its radars would be pointed northeast into North Korea, not into China.  \u201cWe need to have that dialogue. But unfortunately to date, officials in Beijing have been unwilling to meet with our officials and hear that.\u201d http://newsdaily.com/2016/04/china-must-see-missile-defense-is-live-or-die-for-south-korea-seoul-official/"], [8229, "2016-04-18T21:51:00Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2016-04-18T21:41:47Z", [0.85], ""], [12302, "2016-04-18T19:40:22Z", [0.7], "http://thediplomat.com/tag/thaad-deployment-to-south-korea/"], [12302, "2016-04-18T19:36:17Z", [0.6], ""], [51, "2016-04-18T18:54:50Z", [0.09], ""], [691, "2016-04-18T18:16:30Z", [0.21], ""], [1057, "2016-04-18T15:53:54Z", [0.05], ""], [1055, "2016-04-18T15:49:55Z", [0.15], "will not  take that bold step"], [15621, "2016-04-18T15:42:31Z", [0.1], ""], [21691, "2016-04-18T15:34:46Z", [0.1], ""], [14421, "2016-04-18T14:16:01Z", [0.16], ""], [876, "2016-04-18T12:37:48Z", [0.15], ""], [22814, "2016-04-18T12:20:13Z", [0.02], ""], [1993, "2016-04-18T03:01:51Z", [0.15], ""], [1337, "2016-04-18T02:28:29Z", [0.3], "bisecting"], [52, "2016-04-18T00:53:11Z", [0.1], ""], [734, "2016-04-18T00:43:06Z", [0.39], ""], [12874, "2016-04-17T23:49:46Z", [0.16], ""], [83, "2016-04-17T23:27:04Z", [0.04], "Pieces on the Chess board: next move?\nUS has 9 THAAD in the 5 year budget, 7 are funded, 5 will be ready by year end.  \nDefence News article explains some of the other location options.\nhttp://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/army/2016/03/22/army-weighing-thaad-deployments-europe-middle-east/82127616/"], [12879, "2016-04-17T23:20:34Z", [0.0], "Not sure how long the procurement process and, more importantly, how long it will take to get US approval to deploy this weapons system to a second country control.

Turned out to be hard & took about 2 hours. I started by googling what a THAAD is and what is going on that would make this a reasonable question. Apparently a THAAD is a missile you can shoot at other missiles to knock them down. Useful if you have people shooting missiles at you. South Korea wants THAADs because North Korea has recently shown, via tests, that (1) it can make big bombs, and (2) it can shoot them really far. (It tested a hydrogen bomb and it launched a satellite.) OK, next was a question about BASE RATE: how long do negotiations  usually take before the nation announces it's going to install THAADs? Here I had to constantly remind myself what the question actually was not \"will South Korea have THAADs in place by 1 July 2016\" (which seemed impossibly soon for something so logistically complicated) but merely \"will they announce that they will deploy it\". Getting a base rate was very hard because (1) almost no deals of this kind have ever been done, only the UAE and Oman as far as I can tell; (2) the news almost always reports only when a deal is reached, not when talks begin. The only thing I could find was a Feb 2009 announcement [1] that the UAE \"may reach agreement to buy THAAD in 18 months\", and a Dec 2011 announcement [2] that they did --- so ~2 years between news of talks starting, and news of deal closed. I found a May 2013 \"deal closed\" announcement for Oman but no \"talks began\" announcement. OK, that's not a lot of data but let's move on. When did the South Korea talks begin? Officially, on 4 March 2016 [4]. That's less than 4 months to the deadline in the question, or six times faster than the UAE case. That would seem to make a YES answer very unlikely. Let's estimate. In [1] a deal is estimated to take 18 months but in reality took 4 months longer. Let's say 18 months is average time and 4 months is one standard deviation. That would mean a deal in 4 months is 3.5 standard deviations below average. Wildly improbable event, 0.03% chance under normal distribution. If we call 4 half a standard deviation we get a 4% chance. Let's settle on 2% for now. In order to adjust it we may ask (1) if talks had really been going on in secret since much earlier, or  (2) if the UAE example is a bad guide to the SK example. On (1) I found that indeed SK has been eyeing THAADs for a while [5], since 2013. But not exclusively, it considered also other missile defense systems, e.g. sold by Israel. By mid 2014 it had apparently decided to not buy from anyone but develop its own [6], which was estimated to take 5-7 years. That makes me think the deal really is starting now; the fact that North Korea made its bombs known in 29 Jan 2016 reinforces it. THAAD talks scheduled for barely a month later doesn't seem like coincidence. So (1) does not change my 2% estimate. On (2) I am less confident. According to Wikipedia, SK and UAE are about equally strong allies of the United States [7,8]. In both cases there was resistance to THAAD deployment from neighbors (Arab countries in UAE case, China in SK case). If anything I'd guess that Chinese resistance is a bigger hurdle than resistance from any Arab country, so I'd expect SK deals to take even longer than UAE deals. There's also the issue of popular opinion; in SK politicians have to care if Koreans don't want the American presence (there have been protests), while in the UAE the king pretty much just does whatever he wants. Another point towards expecting SK deals to take more than 2 years. On the other hand, perhaps there is some notion of urgency in the SK case, since there is a neighbor with demonstrated WMD capability. I forget what the situation was around the UAE in 2011 but to this day no Arab country has nukes. This kind of makes me want to raise it to 5% or so. Finally, there is a chance that this whole THAAD business is just meant to pressure China into pressuring North Korea; soon after THAAD negotiations began, China voted for sanctions against NK in the UN Security Council. As far as I can tell, there were THAAD meetings in March just before the UNSC meeting, and none since then. I will revise the probability down to 2% again.

That means two weeks just talking about the implications of the election. Then weeks of setting out positions all the 1st tier priorities that the election threw up, which are mostly economic. President Park would be hopelessly out of touch to start making foreign policy announcements when the country is completely focused on other issues.  A scheduled meeting for deputy foreign ministers of Korea, Japan and the US will meet in Seul next week to talk DPRK. They wont be making big announcements (these announcements don't come from deputy FM level meetings anyway) - they'll be working out the implications of the election for their strategic objectives and the 'comfort women issue'. Then they discuss the meeting with their respective capitals...  There's only two ways I can think of that this is announced by July.  First, the DPRK forces action with some sort of missile test or similar. Second, President Park determines she's a lame duck and looks for things she can announce that don't need parliamentary approval (ie: executive orders, to use the US nomenclature).  But even there, I don't think she'd want to put this topic on the table right now when she doesn't know how the new government will respond.  In my view, there is just too much going on in Korean domestic politics for this to really be announcable in 6 weeks. And there's no scheduled moment that I'm aware of that would make it a natural event. So why is the market at 59%? I think the market is over-estimating the chances of this happening because so many people ignore the time frame. Many comments seem to see the recent remarks from a US defence official (I forget name and rank and no time to look it up) that, \"it will happen\" as being definitive. But \"it will happen\" is exactly the sort of forecast that GJP scorns - no time frame, no specific details of what \"it\" entails etc. Just a vague and a-temporal certainty. \nThe market has been steadily drifting up from a very low base over the last 6 days, which I think matches that announcement pretty well. I suspect over-reaction to one piece of evidence. \nI've also noticed a tendency for many participants to offer 0% or 100% predictions. I suspect a number of extreme forecasts are dragging up the average.  I'm comfortable forecasting slightly above last week's average. That wasn't an initial consideration, but now I'm thinking of it and think it's appropriate. While time is ticking down (6 weeks now rather than 7 then) *something* has moved the average forecast a long way. There's a chance my explanation is wrong, and it outweighs the impact of losing 14% of the time available for resolution. We will know much more next week after the deputy FM meeting in Seul.

This is an expression so offensive, when used in conversations between Chinese persons, that it is bound to spark angry resentment in the listener.      \"It is certain that Xi threatened the U.S. with firm determination,\" said one Chinese expert on international affairs.     \" By using the expression \"do harm to\" the U.S., Xi effectively warned Obama that if a THAAD system is actually deployed to South Korea, China reserves the right to take retaliatory measures against the U.S. and South Korea.     \" Now that Xi has issued such a thinly-veiled warning, China will never accept the deployment and will try to take every possible step to block the move. \"Why then did Xi issue such a strong warning to Obama? Part of the reason: the Chinese military feels a strong sense of crisis over the THAAD issue. The THAAD system can track and intercept a ballistic missile fired by an enemy at high altitudes. If the system is deployed to South Korea, its coverage will go beyond the Korean Peninsula and into China. The monitoring range of the THAAD's high-performance radar would cover China's missile bases in inland areas. China fears that the deployment of such a system would neutralize the nuclear missiles it has already deployed. If its nuclear deterrence is undermined, China will also be at a disadvantage militarily in the South China Sea vis-a-vis the U.S. This is a nightmare scenario for China's military.\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160407000938 \"The government has rejected calls to disclose information on the possible deployment of an advanced missile defense system to South Korea, a civic group said Thursday.

When looking back on our revolutionary history, not once has China been sincere towards us when our revolutionary efforts ran into challenges and struggles. Just as our great Suryong leaders have taught us, we must not have even the smallest fantasies about China. We must no longer go easy on the Chinese and instead deal with them on the same footing in order to change their attitude of taking us lightly. All Party members and workers, let us unite more firmly around Marshal Kim Jong Un and fight with all our might to the very end for final victory in our juche revolutionary feat, even if graver hardships and difficulties blow this way, with the deep loyalty and strong belief that so long as our dear Marshal is with us, we will always see victory!\" Remarkable if this is an accurate report.

I would add that while a majority of Korean's currently are in favor of THAAD deployment, many localities do not want it in their back yard, and Korea has not faced the full fury of China's actions yet.  http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-02/15/c_135099371.htm I have another point to raise, which is a bit difficult to define, but still I think generally correct.  Which is that announcement of deployment would only be about three to four months after talks with the U.S. began.  Given the magnitude of this decision, it seems highly improbably to me that Korea would move forward so quickly.  And as JP stated, Korea could justify taking more time to see if sanctions are changing the DPRK's behavior.   I will note that Japan has been \"studying\" THAAD deployment since at least November 2015, about four months to date.  Still no announcement from them for the same basic reasons.

If it's not a bright-red line, then at least it is sunlit. Both Russia and China see THAAD as a step to decrease their missile capabilities (regardless of THAAD's original design). But both Russia and China recognize the chaos and threat DPRK is creating for western countries as well as themselves. Hence, the recent UN Security Council sanctions.  From the US and its allies side, an essential question has to be ....how serious is China and Russia at punishing DPRK and how much effort will they provide to bring DPRK into line. If the sanctions are mostly words, then US and allies will likely take the step forward to THAAD deployment. This would almost certainly be true if another DPRK ballistic nuclear test was implemented. This is of course a guess, but it seems that US and allies will continue the talks with South Korea and Japan about the technical implementation planning. They will make noise about it. But, the deployment will be held off at this point. The trigger will be another DPRK test or the apparent weakness of sanction enforcement by China and Russia.\nSo, my estimate is rather low for the July 2016 date. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35969412\nhttps://sg.news.yahoo.com/moscow-warns-us-over-missile-system-deployment-korea-003126081.html Some  side comments/observations: \nChina needs to start brainstorming a new approach to DPRK. Kim Jong-un has not shown the political savvy of father or grandfather. (Savagery is not equal to savvy.) China may need to start gaming a transition plan that keeps stability, but creates a step forward to some semblance of political balance in that part of the world. One argument FOR deployment of THAAD now is simply the fact that DPRK's recent nuclear blast and ESPECIALLY, their ballistic launch have crossed the US & allies' red-line. If not now, when do we protect ourselves? And certainly, from South Korea's perspective, they are far more vulnerable than anyone and probably the highest target for DPRK.
