(Dow Jones) -- WASHINGTON -- House Democrats released a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package that would restore $600 weekly jobless benefits, a last-ditch effort to revive stalled talks with the White House.\nThe roughly $2.2 trillion legislation was unveiled Monday evening, with a vote possible later this week, according to multiple Democratic aides. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) told her leadership team she planned to talk to the administration on Monday evening, according to a senior Democratic aide.\nDemocrats say a large package is needed to support American households and businesses still experiencing the economic impacts of the pandemic. Any legislation would face immediate hurdles in the GOP-led Senate, where many Republicans have resisted a large new round of deficit spending and expressed more confidence that the economy is recovering, after a sharp slump earlier this year.\n\"We can get this done,\" Mrs. Pelosi said Monday on MSNBC. \"It takes money to crush the virus. It takes money to make the schools safe. It takes money to put money in people's pockets. And, of course, we want some resources to make sure that the state -- that the elections are held.\"\nMany Republican and Democratic lawmakers have pushed for another round of economic stimulus for months, but they have remained far apart on the amount seen as necessary to combat the pandemic that is heading into its ninth month of spreading through the U.S. Lawmakers have been split on the level of weekly unemployment assistance and aid to provide states and cities.\nCentrist House Democrats wanted to vote on the legislation before House lawmakers leave Washington this week for the October recess. Mrs. Pelosi initially resisted voting on the bill, pointing out that the House had already passed a roughly $3.5 trillion bill in mid-May and was still trying to negotiate with the administration on a path forward. Previously, deals that have passed both chambers have been negotiated ahead of time.\nThough the legislation appears to have little immediate prospect of moving forward in the Senate and becoming law, several of the centrist Democrats pushing for a new bill are facing tough races and want to show that they have tried to secure more aid money for their districts.\nBut liberal lawmakers are wary of passing a watered-down bill for political purposes that they worry would provide insufficient relief, aides said. Many House Democrats have said that the $3.5 trillion Heroes Act was no longer enough, saying the country's needs have only grown since its passage.\nThe legislation includes money for restaurants, airlines, child care centers and performance venues hit hard by the pandemic as well as funding for the postal service, which Democrats have said is needed before Election Day. The new bill would include another round of direct checks to Americans, at $1,200 per taxpayer and $500 per dependent. And it would renew the $600 in supplemental unemployment aid that expired in July, according to the text.\nThe package would also extend the Paycheck Protection Program, which expired on Aug. 8, leaving more than $130 billion in funding unused.\nThe bill includes $28 billion for a vaccine, including $20 billion for its procurement, $7 billion for its distribution and $1 billion for a public awareness campaign. In addition, $2 billion is set aside to provide more personal protective equipment for all industries significantly affected by the pandemic. It increases federal spending on Medicaid as well.\nAlso in the package is a measure expanding a tax credit for employee retention that was created in March and has drawn bipartisan support. The program is aimed at keeping workers on payrolls and helping businesses stay afloat by giving employers enough money to cover a percentage of their wages and benefits, plus a credit for fixed expenses like rent.\nMrs. Pelosi will likely have to pass the bill without the support of House Republicans, many of whom are worried about the price of another relief package. Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.), co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, which released a $1.5 trillion proposal earlier this month, said he was concerned House Democrats might be spending too much by going beyond the most urgent priorities.\n\"It may be too large of a package that goes beyond that immediate need,\" Mr. Reed said on a call with reporters Monday. But he said he was encouraged that the negotiations continued and that Democrats were offering a new proposal. \"If we can get to a narrower package, there's support,\" he said."], [94632, "2020-09-28T20:29:46Z", [0.08], "I stand by previous forecasts that this was a lay up for both parties to get passed and neither benefits from no aid being allotted before election day.

The Senate has moved on to SCOTUS, the House is no longer pushing for any measures, and the President has chosen instead to pretend the pandemic is over and bribe seniors with $200 gift cards for drugs.
