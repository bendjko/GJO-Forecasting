So on the one hand, they could raise and start normalising the rate again (they are abnormally low, apparently), or on the other hand, not raise the rates, and maybe keep the jobs momentum going. I might have to adjust depending on the jobs report this afternoon, but the expectation is that it will remain at 5%, which will point towards a rate increase. What I'm thinking of doing next is looking at a sectorwise composition of the jobs increases, and the relationship to exports. The best argument against a rates increase, in my opinion, would be the damage it does to developing markets, and in turn the impact upon US exports.

Why the apparent discrepancy? ... But the easiest way to see what investors expect policymakers to do is to track the Fed funds futures, contracts that are settled at a price determined by where the Fed\u2019s interest rate is in the month of expiry. Simply put, the price is 100 minus the effective Fed funds rate at the time. The December contract currently trades at 99.78, so that implies that investors predict an interest rate of 0.22 per cent, but crucially \u2014 and complicating the calculations \u2014 that is the average over the month. Next year, the Fed funds future for December 2016 is trading at 99.19, which implies an average Fed funds rate of 0.81 per cent in that month. However, those numbers are misleadingly clean, given the complex underlying calculations, and both Bloomberg and the CME\u2019s estimates arguably underplay the likelihood markets really assign to the chances of lift-off in December. Part of the problem is that the Fed moved to an interest rate corridor in the wake of the financial crisis. Rather than targeting a single Fed funds rate by tweaking the amount of money in the system \u2014 the traditional way of easing or tightening monetary policy \u2014 the US central bank in 2008 moved to a range of 0 per cent to 0.25 per cent. As the chart below shows, the effective Fed funds rate has traded within this corridor since then, and averaged around 13.2 basis points \u2014 roughly midway between the two points \u2014 since 2009. [einsteinjs: the current Fed funds rate sits at 0.12 --> http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/25/usa-fedfunds-idUSL1N13K0SU20151125 ] ... The interest rate rise probability calculation depends on whether the Fed goes back to a specific target, or \u2014 as is far more likely \u2014 it simply lifts its corridor target by 25bp. If so, where the effective Fed funds rate settles is pivotal for estimating what probability is implied by the relevant contracts. ... For example, if the effective Fed funds rate ends up closer to the lower end of the central bank\u2019s range then the likelihood of a rate rise implied by Fed funds futures contracts is, in fact, much higher. If the effective Fed funds rate goes to 37.5bp, then the probability is about 70 per cent, as Bloomberg\u2019s calculations imply. But if it is dragged higher by the Fed\u2019s IOER tool then the likelihood implied is lower, points out George Pearkes, an analyst at Bespoke Investment Group. ... On the whole, the most likely explanation for the Fed funds market\u2019s still-notable implied possibility of the Fed holding fire is that the vast majority of traders are in fact girded for interest rate lift-off in December, but simply expect that the Fed funds future will be on the lower end of the new range.

Objectively, based on the data, I just don't see the case for a rate rise, at this juncture. If they like the nascent trends they are seeing, I believe the risk is they squash any positive trend before it is firmly established, as deflation/inflation risks remain asymmetric, and inflation is dangerously low, already.

This is nothing out of the ordinary. This happens every few months & there is nothing \"emergency\" about it, despite what external bloggers may report. More detail: The Fed is holding a regular meeting of the board of governors to discuss the primary credit discount rate on Monday. It's the rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lending facility - the discount window - and has been at 75 bps for the primary credit program since February 2010. At the last such meeting, 5 of the 12 regional Fed banks called for a hike to said rate. However, these recommendations require support from the Board of Governors. It is highly unlikely that the Board (Yellen, Fischer, Tarullo, Powell & Brainard) will approve a discount rate move outside of a move in the fed funds target. Nothing to be concerned about & zero chance of a change today with a decision still \"technically\" up in the air for Dec.  I think Vice Chair Fischer put it best: \"While we at the Fed continue to scrutinize incoming data, and no final decisions have been made, we have done everything we can to avoid surprising the markets and governments when we move, to the extent that several emerging market (and other) central bankers have, for some time, been telling the Fed to 'just do it'.\" Market implied odds this morning are pricing around ~70-75% odds with the only reason they're so low being the opportunity cost of holding a position between now and Dec 16th.

Confidence in jobs growth has replaced worries generated by last summer\u2019s turmoil in the global economy.

The short end of the yield curve would be greatly destabilized should the fed even raise 25 basis points as the 1 mo and 3 mo yield are at 0.06% and 0.11% respectively.  I will raise my expectations of a rate rise if and only if the short end of the curve rises significantly from here, which I don't see happening, as a result of global and domestic growth that continue to trend in the wrong direction. Additionally, inflation  expectations remain muted and there are currently NO signs of an overheating US economy. Inflation/deflation risks remain very asymmetric as the fed can much easier combat inflation--all its tools remain--however it has fired most--if not all--of its bullets with regards to deflation... Rhetoric from the private industry, as opposed to policy makers and bureaucrats, is far more insightful and accurate--they have a self-interest in being \"right\", and are not motivated to try to manipulate expectations towards a desired reality. Ray Dalio, and Jeff Gundlach--just to name two big names in the private investment world, are VERY skeptical of the fed being able to raise rates given current market conditions, implying any meager rate rise would be a political move ONLY and market conditions would force an  immediate reversal. Gundlach and Dalio, smartly point to a slowing global economy, being led by extreme weakness in overseas markets, particularly Europe Japan, and China. China by the way, is in the midst of its own \"1929 moment\" as it is currently suffering  from an unprecedented increase in debt levels, malinvestment and overcapacity. Jim Chanos, whom I believe to be an expert on Chinese markets, has explained their situation as \"whatever you think is happening in China--it's much worse.\" Dalio also makes the same point I made above regarding the yield curve, and the immediate destabilization a rate rise would cause absent an interest rate adjustment that reflects a higher discount rate. In laymen's terms, the treasury market is still saying short term rates  belong at/near zero. A fed raise here, would be akin to a massive intervention in a multi trillion dollar market. The entire commodities complex, most importantly oil, all reflect deflation is much closer than inflation. Commodities are hitting new 6+ year lows on a daily basis, as WTI crude oil, is struggling to find support at 40, only $1.50 above its 6 year low. High yield credit began rolling over in 2014 and is now set to take out its lowest levels since 2011, and emerge in a bear market. At this juncture, the trends in these markets are still inarguably DOWN.  Japan is in a recession (again), the Eurozone, is on the precipice of negative growth, while the ECB trends further and further into negative interest rate policy.

First, the data today is not materially different from the data available in July/August.  Second, the Fed has information that I don't have access to, so, whatever way I rationalize my forecast, it's just a guess made on data I don't have.  The Fed has two explicit mandates: defence of the US currency and full employment.  It seems it also has an implicit goal: to temper the natural business cycle.  So, if the data doesn't make much difference, then what is the real question?  Will Janet Yellen have the courage to raise rates?  She may be swayed by arguments made by other members of the FOMC, but it's her decision in the end.  I am leaning against an increase for using the following rationalizations: 1) Inflation is slightly below target.  I believe Yellen wants err on the side of an inflation rate too high as opposed to too low. \n2) In her public statements, she only stated the \"possibility\" was on the table.  I take that to mean a rate increase in December is a possibility assigned a non-zero probability sufficiently high to take seriously.\n3) The attack in Paris this past weekend has economic implications:  A) European nation-states will need to fund more internal security which will harm growth prospects in Europe.  B) Overall European Union growth will slow as money is diverted to social services for Middle East refugees.  C) Military coordination between the US and EU (and Russia?) with respect to ISIS is obvious.  Europeans can make the case that a degree of economic coordination is also needed.  In the past, Draghi has lobbied against a rate increase.\n4) Commodities denominated in US dollars show no signs of going up.  An interest rate increase will strengthen the US dollar and will drive commodity prices even lower.  (I don't believe this is the result the Fed wants.

CPI is low (near 0 for the year) and without a threat of inflation it is hard to justify a rate increase on the news that wages have made a small uptick recently.  I don't see why it seems an obvious decision to  hike rates when it appears quantitive easing may finally be helping to raise  stagnate wages for the lower and middle class workers. Several economist have pointed this out such as Paul Krugman. There is no data that I've seen that would appear to show that high inflation is a growing concern especially with such low energy prices. It would seem more prudent to wait for wages to increase to the point where a healthy moderate inflation became apparent then slowly raise rates. However, if there is another strong jobs report and any increase in energy cost I could see the Federal Reserve making a small incremental move. For one thing, having rates at near 0 takes an important tool away from the FED. If there is any hiccups in a sensitive economy and rates are at zero, the FED will simply have little they can do, even if it just a psychological effect on the market if they simply can't reduce rates lower then where they stand. This could be a small added incentive to increase rates while things are relatively stable. I think the December numbers will be critical in the final decision. Despite the recent polls of economist predicting an increase I'm more skeptical. I cant see them taking a risk of dampening the small recent growth in wages with near 0 inflation in 2015. If even a small increase has a negative effect on this growth, they will be unlikely to reduce the rates once an increase is implemented. There is also the international pressures to keep rates low. Even as the US economy seems to mildly strengthening, the global economy is fragile. An increased rate may hinder international trade and specifically hurt developing countries purchasing power. Considering the interlinked global economy and the chance that a global slowdown could trickle back into the US economy,  it would seem wiser to wait until an increase is more obviously needed then it is now.

Chairman Yellen made a speech (University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Sept 24, 2015) announcing as much.  It created speculation as to whether a rate increase was \u201cdate\u201d or \u201cdata\u201d dependent. Looking at the date aspect first, it will be very difficult for the FMOC to raise in 2016.  IMHO, this is due to US Presidential politics.  A rate increase in 2016 could be taken as favoring one political party over the other.  (I can make the case either way.)  However, the Federal Reserve needs to protect the public's perception they operate above politics.  Therefore, if they don't raise at the next opportunity (December), it is unlikely they will raise in 2016.  I'll concede they might do it very early in 2016 to give potential economic dislocations a chance to pass.  This is because rate increases have different effects than rate decreases.  They are aware of what happened in 1992 to Bush (41) in the race against Clinton in spite of the Fed's help.  The Fed lowered rates throughout 1991 (10 times!) and in 1992 (3 times) from 6.75% to 3%.  The rate decreases should have helped the incumbent party but did not.  The electorate thought the economy was suffering, and it was that perception that mattered.  (Remember \u201cIt's the economy, stupid!\u201d?)  An interest rate increase will slow an economy which won't be a politically \u201chelpful\u201d thing. Now consider the data.  From a historical point of view, these low interest rates are unprecedented in records going back to the European middle ages (about 500 years).  Interest rates actually mean something extremely important for firms and economies, and rates at a zero-level are probably a bad thing.  (It's clear that any project a firm could imagine would have a positive return has been brought forward due to the time discounting.) What do I expect will happen if a rate increase (no matter how small) were to happen?  First, I expect the US stock markets to go down, but this will be temporary.  I think bonds will be hurt (in particular, high yield bonds will be hurt (eg, JNK, HYG)).  High yield bonds can be somewhat illiquid, so first equities will be liquidated to protect portfolios then bonds will be sold.  After that, money managers will move back to equities that have dividends as a replacement for high yield bond income.  There will also be net wealth inflows into the US  in the form of a currency carry trade. What do I expect will happen if there is no rate increase?  Not much change.  Can kicked down the road.  At some point this ends, but why now? The \u201cFor Rate Increase\u201d Arguments: 1) Credibility of the Fed may be on the line.  Yellen has a place in history, and has realistic concerns over her legacy. 2) While I find monthly jobs data suspect due to how noisy the time series is and due to the adjustments, the US October data showed 271K (non-farm) jobs created.  This satisfies the Fed's employment mandate. 3) The target US inflation rate is 2%.  By the Fed's calculations, US inflation is below this value but maybe close enough. 4) A 0.25% increase is really next to nothing compared to rates over the last 30 years.  So tear the bandaid off and get it over with. 5) Commodity futures (specifically gold and silver) imply market players believe the FMOC will raise. The \u201cAgainst Rate Increase\u201d Arguments: 1) Major world economies are attempting economic easing to get their stalled economies going.  The EU is trying quantitative easing.  The Chinese PBOC has devalued the yuan.  Japan has Abe's \u201cThree Arrows\u201d (or even more arrows now?) program.  Can the US go it alone in the face of actions in the rest of the world?  The Fed did not raise in September.  A reason given was world markets.  This was driven by the August US market correction (which was based on what happened in Chinese markets). 2) Commodities are at relatively depressed prices.  Commodities are US dollar denominated.  Emerging markets dependent on commodities will be hurt.  Economies with currencies pegged to the US dollar will be hurt. 3) The US is funding current government spending, in part, through borrowing.  A higher interest rate will mean pressure on the US budget and debt service. 4) US inflation is below the target 2% level.  An interest rate increase will slow the economy (fewer projects make economic sense), lower economic activity, and lower inflation.  The Fed wants to err on the side of too much inflation rather than too little. What can change my forecast? 1) If the December FMOC meeting passes without a rate increase, then the probability within the question's time frame becomes very low. 2) Public pressure on the Federal Reserve from European central bankers.  In the past, Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde have appealed to Yellen and it seems to have worked. 3) Significant market drops in the US or around the world. 4) Large changes in commodity prices.

The slowing Chinese economy and devaluation of the renminbi, the slumping price of oil, jarring downturns in the global stock markets and grim jobs figures in September have all prompted questions over whether when will be the best time for the Fed to raise interest rates. \"In testimony before Congress on Nov. 4, Ms. Yellen gave some signals that the rate increase could come in December, saying: \u201cAt this point, I see the U.S. economy as performing well,\u201d and that \u201cDecember would be a live possibility.\u201d But she added the cautionary note, however, saying that \u201cno decision has been made.\u201d  \"Ever since March . . . Fed policy makers have used a standard line to describe the conditions that would warrant a rate increase: \u201cThe committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d \"Jeffrey M. Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has been very vocal about the need to raise rates sooner rather than later. In a speech in September, he said: Some might argue that as long as inflation is close to 2 percent we have a free pass \u2014 we can keep supporting the real side of the economy with low rates until inflation rises. But if, as I\u2019ve argued, the real side of the economy calls for a higher interest rate, then there is a real danger associated with this strategy. Inflation is a lagging indicator, and the forces that lead to rising inflation can build up before they are apparent in the data. \"On Sept. 17, after a two-day meeting, the committee decided not to change rates, citing market worries: \u201cRecent information on real U.S. economic activity was generally stronger than expected, but equity prices declined, the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated further, and indicators of foreign economic growth were generally weak.\u201d \"On Oct. 12, Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, argued that the central bank should continue to exercise restraint in raising rates. \u201cI view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside. The downside risks make a strong case for continuing to carefully nurture the U.S. recovery \u2014 and argue against prematurely taking away the support that has been so critical to its vitality.\u201d \"The following day, Daniel Tarullo, another member of the board of governors, said he did not \u201cexpect that it would be appropriate\u201d for the Fed to start raising its benchmark rate this year. \u201cWith credit becoming more expensive, the outlook for the Chinese economy clouded at best, emerging markets submerging, the U.S. stock market in a correction, widespread concerns about liquidity, and expected volatility having increased at a near-record rate, markets are themselves dampening any euphoria or overconfidence. The Fed does not have to do the job. At this moment of fragility, raising rates risks tipping some part of the financial system into crisis, with unpredictable and dangerous results.\u201d\n\u2014 Lawrence H. Summers, former Treasury secretary, writing in The Financial Times (Aug. 23) \"A rate rise is overdue, but the Fed must be very cautious: . . . The Fed is beginning to recognize that six years of zero bound interest rates have negative influences on the real economy.\u201d\n--William H. Gross, a co-founder of Pimco who now manages a fund at Janus Capital, writing in his September Investor Outlook (Sept. 2)\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  My analysis of this question is unclouded by any ideas of what the Fed \"should\" do, as I am totally ignorant about economics.

Eight of the 12 regional reserve banks voted last month to increase a secondary but symbolic policy rate. And the Fed\u2019s statement highlighted the December meeting.  \u201cIn determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress \u2014 both realized and expected \u2014 toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation,\u201d the statement said.

And the Fed specifically said that job growth, a primary focus, had weakened in recent months, although the statement added that officials expect a rebound. \u201cIn short, Fed officials are specifically highlighting the potential for tightening as soon as the December meeting,\u201d said Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cThey seem less worried about global headwinds but the slowing in payrolls in the last two reports has got their attention.\u201d \"Inflation, however, remains weak, and Ms. Yellen is facing opposition from a small but significant minority of Fed officials \u2014 including three of the 10 voting members of the policy committee \u2014 who say the Fed should not move until it sees clear evidence of inflationary pressures. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, emphasized the importance of global forces in a recent speech. \n. . . \n\"Liberal economists and activists \u2014 including some former Obama administration officials \u2014 also continue to warn that raising rates in December would be a mistake because millions of Americans are still looking for jobs and there are no signs that inflation poses a threat. \"New economic data in the coming weeks could determine relatively quickly whether December remains a plausible option.

The decision, part of a broader effort to liberalize the banking system and make it more efficient, may help increase household incomes, a critical piece of the economic puzzle. \nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/49516007.cms"], [102, "2015-10-24T16:18:57Z", [0.55], "Crowd.

Ms. Brainard is considered dovish on policy but has generally kept her public comments non-controversial, but in a speech Monday to a business forum in Washington D.C. she clearly outlined the dovish case for holding off on rate hikes for the foreseeable future.  She not only took issue with a possible rate hike by year-end, she denounced the use of a \u201ccalendar-based\u201d rate decision that has crept into more and more Fed commentary. Thus, she has positioned herself firmly against the stance taken in recent speeches and comments from Chair Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. And while we may be used to conflicting statements coming from Fed presidents on the FOMC, this is the first time in a while  that we have a statement from a Fed governor that directly contravenes the current outlook of Fed leadership.

It was the right decision. In fact, I\u2019m among the economists wondering why we\u2019re even thinking about raising rates right now. \"But the financial industry\u2019s response may explain what\u2019s going on. You see, the Fed talks a lot to bankers \u2014 and bankers reacted to its decision with sheer, unadulterated rage. For those trying to understand the political economy of monetary policy, it was an \u201cAha!\u201d moment. Suddenly, a lot of what has been puzzling about the discussion makes sense: just follow the money. \"The basic principles of interest rate policy are fairly simple. . .  If rates are too low, inflation will accelerate; if rates are too high, inflation will fall and perhaps turn into deflation. \"By this criterion, it\u2019s hard to argue that current rates are too low. . . . the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure . . . has consistently fallen short of its own target of 2 percent, and shows no sign of rising. \" rates  . . . are very low by historical standards. And it\u2019s interesting to ask why the economy seems to need such low rates. But all the evidence says that it does. Again, if you think that rates are much too low, where\u2019s the inflation? \"Yet the Fed has faced constant criticism for its low-rate policy. Why? \"The answer is that the story keeps changing. . . . The justification du jour is \u201cfinancial stability,\u201d the claim that low interest rates breed bubbles and crashes. \"I suppose this latest excuse for raising rates could be right. But it\u2019s striking how convoluted and dubious the case for rate hikes has become. . . .  \" . . . when you see ever-changing rationales for never-changing policy demands, it\u2019s a good bet that there\u2019s an ulterior motive. And the rate rage of the bankers \u2014 combined with the plunge in bank stocks that followed the Fed\u2019s decision not to hike \u2014 offers a powerful clue to the nature of that motive. It\u2019s the bank profits, stupid. \" . . .  What\u2019s clear . . .  is that low rates are bad for bankers. \"For banks make their profits by taking in deposits and lending the funds out at a higher rate of interest. And this business gets squeezed in a low-interest environment: the rates banks can charge on loans are pushed down, but rates on deposits can only go so low. The net-interest margin \u2014 the difference between the interest rate banks receive on loans and the rate they pay on deposits \u2014 has fallen sharply over the past five years. \"The appropriate response of policy makers to this observation should be, \u201cSo?\u201d There\u2019s no reason to believe that what\u2019s good for bankers is good for America. But bankers are different from you and me: they have a lot more influence. Monetary officials meet with them all the time, and in many cases expect to join their ranks when they come out on the other side of the revolving door. Also, it\u2019s widely assumed that bankers have special expertise on economic policy, although nothing in the record supports this belief. . . .  \"So we shouldn\u2019t be surprised to see institutions that cater to bankers, not to mention much of the financial press, spinning elaborate justifications for a rate hike that makes no sense in terms of basic economics.

If China were to be rushed to the ICU, falling dominoes could cause another Great Recession. (There, am I the queen of mixed metaphors or not?) Logical analysis:  See the comparison class  of previous Fed meetings Does each meeting lead to a decision on the basis of the current situation only? Does it factor past decisions into the analysis, for example after 63 decisions to not increase the rate, could this mean a change is overdue? Does the Fed make forecasts that include the world economy? It seems to me that the sunk costs fallacy is not relevant to Fed rate increases. So a long string of no decisions should not lead to an emotional prediliction to keep on saying no as a way of validating the sunk costs, so to speak, of so many no decisions. Also, neither can we apply the gambler's fallacy that after an unusual number in a row of double snake eyes in a dice game, the goddess of luck must be ready for yet another -- dice are HOT!! Or the goddess is more likely that average to make the dice come up double sixes!  My reasoning is that the Fed comprises analysts of sufficient knowledge of probability and statistics that each meeting considers only the current situation, and develops forecasts of alternate futures based upon good data combined with this mathematical sophistication. I also am going with the proposition that these forecasts include the world economy.
