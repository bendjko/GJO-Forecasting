The first four people named (President, Vice President, White House Press Secretary, White House Chief of Staff) are all \"on the side of\" the President, and can suffer a lot of punishment if they deviate from what he wants. So we can approximate their incentives by Trump's. Since everyone seems to have forgotten about this op-ed, I can't see how it would benefit Trump to bring it up again. Plus, by naming someone, he makes it more concrete / believable, and thus appears weak --- he cannot control his underlings, he doesn't fully control what happens in govt, etc. (I admit I didn't read the op-ed.) The other option is he names someone but as a writer of fiction --- e.g. he names Hillary Clinton as the author or whatever. I guess that could happen, but it seems a more fragile position than just maintaining that some abstract \"enemy\" wrote it. The latter isn't disprovable. Maybe if Trump was about to run in an election against opponent X, he could name X, but he's not. The Attorney General and Trump seem frequently at odds, so the former's incentives may not be close to Trump's. However, Google has just told me that Trump said Sessions should investigate who wrote the op-ed. So in hindsight I realize that the Attorney General probably can't name a suspect just from a gut feeling. He has to carry out an investigation, which doesn't even look like it's going to happen, and if it does, it'll take a while. Finally, there's probably some incentive for the party who wrote the op-ed to come forward --- a book deal? Fifteen minutes of fame?

I find it unlikely that it was a lone wolf acting on only her/his behalf as that would have left too much guessing room to other WH staffers meaning her/his identity could easily become known.\n2. Possibility that it was no actually written by a (current) staffer - however that possibility low I would say not higher than 10%.\n3. As mentioned in the op-ed piece the \u201cresistance\u201d member is a high-up in WH staff.

I assume up to 10 people on both sides know the actual identity/identities of the person(s) who actually wrote the piece or gave it their candid approval. To me likely announcers are the following - President, WH Press Secretary and WH Chief of Staff\no\tPresident most likely due to personality and probably seeing it as personal retribution to such betrayal.

If there is one thing I learned it was that President Vladimir Putin, who directs the lion\u2019s share of Russia\u2019s military and intelligence actions against the United States, continues \u2013 like his Soviet predecessors \u2013 to view the U.S. as Russia\u2019s \u201cmain enemy.\u201d I have a high degree of confidence that Putin analyzed the op-ed with the greatest of interest. And I believe he then directed his intelligence services to collect corroborating intelligence and prepare options for weaponizing its content, as a part of Russia\u2019s espionage and information attacks on the U.S. Russian intelligence would first focus on learning more about the author, whose identity is known to The New York Times. Russia would not rule out the possibility that not one but perhaps a number of Trump administration officials collaborated on the piece. The Kremlin is the most sophisticated purveyor of \u201cfake news,\u201d including social media and networking manipulation and amplification through bots. We should expect the Kremlin to mount a full-court press targeting not only Washington officials with access to the author\u2019s identity, but also targeting The New York Times \u2013 both through human intelligence operations as well as intrusions in cyberspace. Keep in mind that Russian hackers successfully targeted the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign. The New York Times should be prepared to defend itself from a Russian onslaught of phishing and social engineering attacks. Russia no doubt desperately wants to know who in the administration is operating against the president. In \u201cEssence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis,\u201d Graham Allison and Phillip Zelikow outline three approaches to understanding government behavior: \u00b7         The rational actor model, where governments \u2013 like individuals \u2013 make the most rational decisions based on a cost and benefit analysis. \u00b7         The organizational process model, which focuses on the standard operating procedures inherent to any bureaucracy. \u00b7         The government politics model, which focuses on how the key \u201cplayers\u201d \u2013 both people and organizations \u2013 compete for influence. This best reflects the high priority Russian intelligence would attach to understanding how senior Trump administration officials relate to one another and the president. Understanding these internal dynamics \u2013 the alleged \u201ctwo-track presidency\u201d described in the New York Times op-ed \u2013 would help Russia understand and predict U.S. policy with the highest degree of confidence. For Russian intelligence it is not important whether the anonymous op-ed writer\u2019s claim that senior Trump administration officials are working to frustrate parts of the president\u2019s agenda is in fact true. It also does not matter if the op-ed is correct in saying that President Trump\u2019s leadership style is \u201cimpetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.\u201d Russia invented the term \u201cdisinformation.\u201d The Kremlin is the most sophisticated purveyor of \u201cfake news,\u201d including social media and networking manipulation and amplification through bots. Russia\u2019s goal is to sow cultural and political discord in the U.S. and degrade trust in our democratic institutions. Russia would eagerly insert these themes into its information operations with an eye towards degrading both the U.S. domestic political process as well as foreign governments\u2019 trust in the Trump administration. Russian intelligence would seek to use its media platforms to sprinkle corroborating \u201cevidence\u201d to buttress the op-ed\u2019s attacks on the president. Putin is always cognizant of the potential for an Arab Spring or Color Revolution to end his regime. So he would seek to influence brave Russian protesters not to look to the U.S. for inspiration in their struggle for liberty, freedom and democracy \u2013 all absent in Russia. Russian intelligence is ruthlessly focused on ensuring the anonymous op-ed is transformed into a Pandora\u2019s Box, which might appear to be a gift to some of the president\u2019s critics but becomes a Kremlin curse on us all.

But for all we know it could only take 8 weeks.  You just know Trumpski is predictably unpredictable and will use it as an excuse to fire Klanno Sessho the AG after mid-terms. So around 12 weeks then?  Also calling for the FBI/DoJ to investigate the non-crime just ratchets up the odds. Fatso Stevo Banno was fired for 'disloyalty' by boasting about winning it for the orange tanned client. George Conway tweets a lot about how bad Trumpo is, so maybe his wife Kelly-Anne Conway did it? Linguistics seemed a bit more lawyerly, conservative and masculine but Kelly-Anne is smart enough to write it like that to obfuscate.  Weight a lot more due to twitchy Twitter-fingers early in the morning or late at night will flip over to irrationality as usual. As we know a few scandals cause a few temper tantrums, and we're only 4 or 5 in a row in 24 to 48 hours away from pressing 000001 (I'm assuming the nuke codes were just changed from 000000 to 000001).  So let's go with 85%.  As another option besides Conway, I keep thinking it's one most people haven't heard of - it seems like they're not the one actually doing it, but have heard of others taking documents out of the In tray etc and have sort of blown the whistle in a way to warn them off doing it again or soothe their conscience. So maybe a not-quite-so-senior person, like an aide in late 30s to mid 40s, like an ex-mil or -DoJ type with integrity and honour.  Like a small town country lad (not many women there) that grew up with GOP-voting parents and went to church every Sunday.  But who knows, most people can attempt to disguise the linguistics - such as the 'lodestar' to throw off with Pency as red herring. It'd have to be someone there daily to take docs off the Resolute desk, but maybe we're focusing too much on that or giving that example too much importance.
