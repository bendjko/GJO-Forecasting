This forecast takes into account only this kind of testing. My assumption is that over late spring and summer, number of tests, which is now based mostly on testing moderate to severe COVID conditions, will be going down due to social distancing and, to lesser extent, seasonal nature of coronavirus. My estimate is that the number of tests (according to my logistic model) will be between 6 to 7 million. The real number of infections, if asymptomatic and mild cases are included, of course, is much higher, but due to limiting factors - number of kits, equipment, PPE, trained lab personnel... - it is not reflected in number of performed tests.  When testing based on \"need\" as described above will go down, the other form of testing will pick up - testing all suspects including mild cases and contacts - the precondition to open the economy. You would think, with widely accessible testing, these numbers will go up and up and up. But South Korea\u2019s experience shows the opposite - testing goes significantly down after the outbreak is subdued. There is always a background of colds, but these ones fall during summer. With significantly less new mild, moderate and severe cases, less testing is needed for potential (asymptomatic) suspects as well. I expect it will not exceed number of tests based on \u201cneed\u201d. So, it will be less than 15 million by August 1st. There is a hidden danger though \u2013 another kind of \u201cCOVID tests\u201d will be widely available soon \u2013 serological tests for antiviral antibodies and viral antigens. They will be cheaper and in theory can be used for diagnosis \u2013 especially early antigens and (IgM) antibodies\u2013 but they are less sensitive: antigens appear first in blood, then IgM antibodies, then IgG antibodies. And it requires more time for specimens become positive \u2013 days for antigens in blood, close to a week for IgM and two weeks or more for IgG - to become detectable. And it is in blood, requiring a blood draw or a prick to get a sample. So RNA testing of nasopharyngeal swabs will remain a gold standard - COVID-19 starts as a disease of respiratory system after all.\nBut it will reveal a real (huge) number of SARS-CoV-2 infections \u2013 by picking up past infections when looking at the late IgG antibodies. If serological tests for this purpose are included in \u201cCOVID-19 tests\u201d, the latter can get a huge boost. Then my forecast can become huge underestimation. The interesting thing is that most probably, it will be not a nation-wide effort as the administration is not interested in how many people have been really infected - it is bad for reelection. So it is known unknown that is hard to predict.
