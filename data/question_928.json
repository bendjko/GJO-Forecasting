Now the U.S. has just escalated the tariff war with a new threat, but if history is any guide, China will wait until those tariffs actually take effect to retaliate. This could be a while though: A senior WH official \"said that the process of imposing tariffs on the new list of goods would take roughly two months, with a public hearing on the tariffs scheduled for Aug. 20 through Aug 23.\" [1] EDIT: However, there is another salvo of U.S. tariffs in the pipeline that might come in less than \"two weeks\" [2] so there is a possibility a retaliation from China would include aircrafts.

They've been very careful to respond in kind but also to wait until the last minute to see if Trump flip flops on his plans and doesn't go through.  If the July 6 tariffs go through, I am sure China's will as well.  Trump has threatened to retaliate and is probably hoping China will back down first; China doesn't need to nor seem inclined to show any form of desperation or deferential attitude toward the US or Trump, so if Trump responds and planned, I am sure China will as well even though they haven't formally announced what their relations might be.  I would give Trump's chance of going through with the July 6 tariff's above 80% and China's likelihood of responding in kind 100%.  However, I would expect Trump's likelihood of following through on his second round of tariffs much lower - maybe 15-25%.  News flurry as July 6 approaches, etc.  China has responded pretty aggressively and quickly to US threats and tariffs (US bumps tariffs but exempts China and Canada and China responds with tariffs against the US; Trump threatens $100bn and China reduces tariffs on products with other countries but not the US; Trump plans to go through with $50bn of proposed $100bn tariffs and China responds immediately with $34bn of their proposed $70bn against US imports) https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/19/how-the-us-ended-up-in-an-escalating-trade-dispute-with-china.html However, it seems possible also that China can respond by cutting out Boeing in favor of Airbus without a specific tariff despite the April warning. Or even start selling US Treasury bonds.  But given what they've done so far, it seems likely that they will do a bit of both.  They most want to show their power without destroying the economy - enough to get Trump to stop aggressive threats and public confrontation for political or economic benefits, which is what they've been emphasizing the last several years and what they've been repeating in the news lately.  A two-pronged route seems most likely also because \"...China cannot match the US on a like-for-like basis \u2013 it simply does not buy the same value of American goods \u2013 exerting pressure on multinational companies that have operations in China could be a way for it to influence US policymakers and ease the trade tension.\" http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2152090/china-us-trade-war-business-leaders-officials-scrabble\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-06/22/c_137271886.htm So it seems likely that China will still retaliate against Trump's recent measures and having already included aircraft in a previous warning, it's reasonable to expect that it is still on the table.

A clue to his tactics may be revealed during French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe\u2019s visit to Beijing this weekend, where he\u2019ll try to seal a deal for more than 180 Airbus A320 jets.  The $18-billion order, if confirmed, would send a strong signal to the US that China has effective options to hit hard where it hurts. The Asian power is likely to favor Airbus planes for future orders, according to Jin Wei, an aviation researcher at China Center for Information Industry Development, a state-backed think tank in Beijing. \u201cAwarding big plane orders to Airbus will be a wake-up call to the US that China has alternatives and does not fear clashing with US on trade,\u201d Jin said.  Such a strategy may also help China drive deeper divisions within the Group of Seven nations, whose leaders in Europe and Canada are struggling to adapt to challenges from an unpredictable Trump on issues ranging from security to exports. Germany\u2019s foreign minister last week called on European nations to unite and fill the void left by the US pullback from global agreements.  ...To be sure, China isn\u2019t likely to dump Boeing altogether for Airbus. Nor is the Airbus order a given, considering Sino-French relations haven\u2019t hit all the right notes. Though Macron has shown more inclination to connect with China than his predecessors and has pledged to visit once a year, he said in Canada this month that the Asian country couldn\u2019t yet join the G7 because it doesn\u2019t share the club\u2019s values. Yet, Trump\u2019s policies may give China enough reasons to tilt the balance in favor of Airbus, said Corrine Png, chief executive officer and founder of Crucial Perspective Pte., a Singapore-based research firm focused on transportation.  \u201cWe expect Airbus\u2019s market share in China to increase going forward,\u201d she said. Back in April, as trade tensions heated up, China fired a warning shot with the threat of a 25 percent levy on aircraft categories that included the largest Gulfstream luxury jets and older and smaller 737 models nearing the end of their production run. But the measure stopped shy of penalizing the 737 Max 8, Boeing\u2019s best-selling new model. https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/06/22/stocks-hurt-trump-china-trade-war/717640002/\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-15/boeing-737-pitted-against-chinese-spacecraft-as-trade-war-grows\nhttp://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2151996/china-stocks-verge-bear-market-after-week-saw-us514-billion"], [691, "2018-06-22T12:53:49Z", [0.0], ""], [48709, "2018-06-22T04:47:08Z", [0.8], "O' Canada how green your grass is now tourism Will be brisk there and US tariffs will really mean a thing."], [46079, "2018-06-21T20:42:51Z", [0.6], ""], [29860, "2018-06-21T18:47:12Z", [0.0], ""], [29860, "2018-06-21T18:47:05Z", [0.05], ""], [57918, "2018-06-21T18:15:49Z", [0.0], ""], [13306, "2018-06-21T06:22:52Z", [0.1], ""], [13306, "2018-06-21T06:22:29Z", [0.2], ""], [30364, "2018-06-21T00:56:27Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-06-20T19:51:42Z", [0.01], ""], [37488, "2018-06-20T05:17:14Z", [0.7], "Beijing said on Tuesday it will use \u201cquantitative and qualitative\u201d measures to hit back at US President Donald Trump\u2019s act of \u201cblackmail\u201d in threatening to impose tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese products.

China has made it clear that it will react quickly and firmly to tariffs, but that they don't really want them and are willing to reconsider if the US is willing to participate in talks and follow WTO protocols.  Trump generally hates to back down, except that this really is bad news and when he is wrong or planning to hedge a bluff or aggressive move he has made, he generally lets it lay quietly for a while and then buries the decision, which he may do on the proposed tariffs after the 30 days comment period.  China will lose some but not nearly as much as the US will, and although Chinese companies have made a huge deal with Boeing and seem to prefer it within the industry over Airbus, they are also also trying to encourage their own company to develop and expand.  It is of course nowhere near ready to manage primary aircraft manufacturing in China, but China has a variety of other places it can go to expand which may be cheaper (Boeing is good but expensive and slow to develop new equipment/models; it also outsources 50% of its aerospace engineering).  In the end, it will probably encourage relationships in regions of the world where China is looking to expand partnerships already.   I suppose that leaves a lot dependent on Trump, and although he hates to do an about-face, he's done it in the past when it's clear there's not much to be achieved.  He tends to stay strongest in his positions when he has a support base, and a lot of his support base isn't going to like this. https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeboyd/2018/04/02/boeing-china-us-travel-to-experience-minimal-fallout-from-tariff-disputes/#2cd823312ce6\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2018/04/11/u-s-tariffs-would-pull-chinas-aircraft-dream-out-of-the-sky/#71e68f08423d\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/cd3f286e-315f-11e8-b5bf-23cb17fd1498\nhttp://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1097818.shtml\nhttp://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/11/09/china-signs-37-billion-deal-to-buy-300-boeing-planes-.html\nhttp://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2127678/french-president-macron-confirms-china-will-buy-184-airbus-a320\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/comac-the-maker-of-chinas-first-passenger-jet-sets-its-sights-on-southeast-asia.html\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/will-made-in-china-jets-threaten-boeing-and-airbus-quicktake/2018/04/10/2616ccf0-3c7b-11e8-955b-7d2e19b79966_story.html?utm_term=.b073e8469d5d\nhttp://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1097023.shtml\nhttp://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-08/22/content_30940595.htm\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/10/c_137101018.htm\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2141566/meet-chinese-farmers-delighted-prospect-us-trade-war\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2141032/xi-jinpings-defence-globalisation-and-open-markets-key-takeaways\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2138685/trump-tariffs-are-bid-force-chinas-hand-because-it\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2139858/china-hits-back-trump-retaliatory-tariffs-128-us\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2140263/china-strikes-back-25pc-tariffs-106-us-imports-all-out\nhttp://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2141035/why-china-should-walk-away-trade-war-and-toss-us-some\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2141567/china-us-talking-avoid-trade-war-says-oecd-boss\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/tariffs-china-will-fight-back-if-us-escalates-trade-spat.html\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/foreign-workers-for-us-jobs-a-rarity-at-boeing/"], [45198, "2018-04-14T01:05:35Z", [0.1], "I think the USA will back track on it's tariff threats.
