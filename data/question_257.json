(this is up 47% compared to the same period last year. 640 for the same time period this coming half of the year would be 640+640=1280, which gives this answer a YES. \nTaliban seem to carry out the majority of the attacks, due to their much greater control of territory, and numbers. I will attribute a conservative 50% of total deaths to Taliban, and 10% of total deaths to IS. Thus IS would be responsible for 160 deaths for that portion of the year. It seems unlikely this will reach 1000 before the years end. \nIt\u2019s possible that the numbers of civilians killed by both sides will increase, but as the pro-government forces have already increased much more this year (47%), I doubt they will increase substantially more, in the coming 4 months. Possibly to a 50% increase on last year (Jul \u2013 Dec 2015). As such, I will say that 650 people between July and end of Dec will be killed by pro-government forces. That brings the total this year by pro-government forces to 1300, exceeding the mass killing definition. So my answer is Yes, It is likely to occur. But how likely? Over 50%, anyway. We have seen since July, that the US are not removing as many US soldiers from Afghanistan as previously planned, due to rising violence and tensions in Afghanistan. Also, IS and Taliban have formed a shaky peace pact to combat the US and pro-government afghan soldiers\u2026 it\u2019s possible that there will be even higher ground fighting \u2013 which is what is contributing most to civilian casualties at the moment.

START's Global Terrorism Database has roughly 10,700 casualties in terror attacks in Afghanistan in 2015, let's guess that half of those were fatalities--5350. Thanks @Khalid and @sjens for the numbers, assuming 1600 for the first half of the year that would be 3200 for the whole year and I'll average that with my GTD-based guess of 5350 for a year of fatalities, (5350 + 3200)/2 = 4275.  There are about four months left before 1 January 2017, 1/12 = .083 * 4 = .332 .  We're approaching the cold part of the year when the weather is less conducive to fighting in Afghanistan so let's downgrade the .332 by .1 to .232. 4275 * .232 = 992 estimated fatalities for a four month time period. Afghanistan is no more stable than it was in 2015. Afghanistan in 2013 and 2014 saw fewer causalities from terror attacks, a lot fewer in 2013, and about 20% fewer in 2014.  I'm guessing around 662 killed in an average four month period over the years 2013-2015.

I recently wrote a short paper on Afghanistan and am in regular contact with the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Kabul. The situation has gotten worse every month during the past 1-2 years, especially since the Afghanistan version of the Islamic State became active in late 2015. That being said, my risk asessment for a new episode of mass killings is very low. I would like to link to some articles I used in our monitor, but it's down right now. ;-) So I'll link them later. UNAMA keeps a very good quarterly count of civilian casualties. It's also the only one avaiable for Afghanistan, so this has to be THE source to go to for the EWP. This makes this question easier to forecast than others. UNAMA tracks actors and the type of the killing (e.g. fighting, IEDS, targeted killings...). For sake of identifying deliberateley killed civilians, I assume the EWP has to ignore all battle-related deaths. So while the toll of civilians killed by government forces has increased, these sometimes disturbing numbers won't resolve this question. There are targeted killings (warcrimes) comitted by gov. forces, e.g. by the tribal militias used by the gov., that would count. But they should not come close to resolve this question. This leaves us with the Islamic State in Afghanistan. The Islamic State in Afghanistan has risen to prominence by applying the same tactics that they use elsewhere: Using brutal force and displaying their brutality very publicly.  They started off with killing tribal elders in the South-East by forcing them to sit down on landmines and then let them explode remotely. The IS distributed the video locally. This was an unprecedented move - even for Afghanistan. They continued on with some middle-scale and one large-scale terror attack. If they will archieve the capability, I am very sure that they will resolve this question. Their aim seems to be to demonstrate that they are more effective than the Taliban. However, while they indeed recruited a bunch of extremist Taliban fighters, they mainly consists of foreigners and indeed alinate the local population by attacks such as the one against the very respected tribal elders. The whole point of the Taliban ist their local Pashtun identity combined with their very strong Afghan national values. The IS just cannot provide that. The only angle of the IS is that they \"get things done\". SO far, the US and the Afghan gov. moved  very strongly against the IS as soon as it proclaimed their Afghan version. And so did the Taliban. The IS is therefore being confronted with multiple enemys. For the IS to resolve this question, it needs to grow stronger and it needs to convince a larger number of Talibans to join their cause. I don't see this happening in this timeframe. I might overrate the patience and loyality of the different Taliban elements however. There are conflicts inside the different Taliban and they grow increasingly frustrated. That would be the hole the soft spot has to push into. My low forecast does not render this question dispensable, as this by itself, would be a valuable risk assessment. If it's correct. ;) Edit: Of course there is the possibility that the IS and the Taliban might join forces, especially since ex-Taliban members that joined the IS should still have some contact to their ex-fellow fighters and they got a big common enemy. While this very well might occur from time to time locally, I don't expect a broader and lasting alliance between the two, because their aims and means are just too different.

Either a new target needs to be undertaken by the taliban or a different organization needs to target a civilian group. Something I find hard to pin down is how broad are the 'groups'? Can there be overlap between 'groups' e.g. could one civilian death be counted in multiple targeted groups? With how things stand, the anti-govt forces are attributed with 60% of civilian deaths (~960), if there is currently an ongoing mass killing, then the number of killings that could be attributed to a NEW mass killing goes down. By how much? Depends on overlap between groups... shot in the dark - 50% (480 left to count towards new). Projecting that to the end of year gives 960, which is not a new mass killing, but this does not account for possibilties of state-led mass killing, a risk, but less likely than one by Taliban (how much? idk).
