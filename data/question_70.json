Here is why.  Comment:  For domestic purposes in the run up to Russian elections within two weeks on 18/9/16, Mr. Putin is active on the global stage looking to be very Presidential for those few Russians that... eventually decide... to go to the polls (Footnote 3). In point of substantive fact, the Russian voter has virtually NO option  as Putin is his own next viable candidate. (4)  Nonetheless, on the one hand, if not making waves at the G20 Summit at HANGZHOU, China calling US & Russian relations \"frozen\" on various Syrian issues (1), then Mr.\nPutin is making a clear effort at improving relations with Japan PM Abe (2). He is making every effort to remain in the global/geopolitical eye.  On the other hand, in the Middle East, as Putin continues to face of VARIOUS & SUNDRY UN EMBARGO initiatives, he nonetheless makes a serious effort to craft a complex tripartite relationship between Iran, Turkey & Russia on the issue of extending Assad's continued existence as leader of Syria (5). Questionable, but to date effective,  for both Putin & Assad. NB: IRAN remains also extremely supportive of Assad as well. (5a) All backward looking analysis.  Forward looking probability variations include the fact that Putin is still Putin. Probability calculation is therefore extremely low.  This said, is there not a is a risk of OVER estimating his impact?  (6) That is, in spite of their relatively underweighted geopolitical economic impact, the Russians continue to stir up an overweighted concern to many Eastern European Countries that view a Russian military build up on their respective borders as troublesome.(7) However, is such a move PRIMARILY for domestic consumption or, are there more nefarious motives? (7).  All extremely relevant questions to a NATO member Country invoking Article 4. Importantly, at least for Putin, the Germans continue to be a critical counter-weight to a NATO Article 4 push by any Eastern European Country. NB: Putinversteher (8)  Putin recognize, and takes geopolitical leverage / advantage, of this fact that Germans abhor & will do their upmost to avoid at all costs, saber rattling as their borders as they are at risk and, continue to exert significant influence on this issue.  Thus, a forward looking, hopefully  imaginative out of the box analysis, includes what probabilities the RARELY used NATO Article 4 provision can be used by \" other NATO\" members?(9)  In light of the above-mentioned fact that Eastern European Countries face a difficult counterweight in Germany to calling on NATO Article 4 provisions, proper analysis leaves historical considerations, including Turkey which does have a history of taking advantage of the NATO provision (9). CAVEAT: Here as well, Putin has made a progress with Erdogan on the issue of the recent unsuccessful military coup. Putin may have provided, through his security apparatus, notice to Erdogan that he must be careful. A warning. (10). Such a scenario leaves Erdogan & Putin, at least for the foreseeable future, in the same camp. Thus, Turkey would also be an unlikely candidate to invoke a NATO Article 4 call.  Conclusion: Slightly over, one hundred & twenty days (120) remain towards resolution of this GJ Q. Russian elections are purely procedural with no substantive change. Erdogan has taken over Turkey's military & economic apparatus. There is a certain \"closer relationship\" btw the two Countries.  The Germans continue to act as a counterweight to real Eastern European concerns on Russian borderline forays. The US elections are a further \"wait and see\" element for all Parties at stake on this NATO Article 4 Q.  Weighing the sum of all the above-mentioned geopolitical parts, there is marginal probability any NATO member will invoke Article 4 in response to actions taken by Russia b/f 1/1/17.

COMMENT: Putin's geopolitical gains in Ukraine, Crimea & Syria have essentially gone unchecked in Warsaw this weekend. Lots of talk but, little substantive action aside from the agreed upon troop deployment which, can in substance, act as NO reasonable deterrent.  Post NATO summit,  what REMAINS clear is NATO & the Germans are not on the same playing when it comes to \"hard line\" responses to  Putin tactics. Renzi  of Italy & Holland in France provided public comments that leave room for argument that Putin has room to maneuver, with their more \"cautious\" stance on \"more aggressive actions\" beyond this weekends outcome. http://www.rferl.mobi/a/hollande-russia-is-a-partner-not-a-threat/27847690.html This political wedge btw other BALTIC nations that remain v concerned about Russian sovereign encroachments &, the Germans \"more cautious\" approach ENHANCES  the present DISEQUILIBRIUM leaving NATO, the Germans & the US w/ an insoluble dilemma. Additionally, U.S. will not become involved beyond this weekends comments by Obama, especially during the election phase. On the one hand, Germans still carry a sizable importance on decision making. This \"opposition\" to aggressive geopolitical signals & behavior towards Putin is long standing &, well beyond Steinmeier's recent \"NATO must avoid saber rattling\" remarks.   The PUTINVERSTEHERS have a long history. Ex Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, FDP's Steinmeier &, others provide a Counterweight to a more aggressive approach suggested by BALTIC, NATO & other EU partners. 1.

Once a minority, the Putinvertehers\u2019 ranks have swelled the longer the West\u2019s standoff with Russia has gone on. The push is partly driven by the business community. Though Russia ranks only 16th among Germany\u2019s export markets, a number of influential companies, from Siemens to Volkswagen, invested heavily in the country and are feeling the pinch of sanctions. A lobby for German businesses in Russia, known the Ost-Auschuss, has been tireless in urging an end to the sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Putinversteher see the NATO summit and the policy of reassurance toward Poland and the Baltics as bad for business,\u201d Gressel said.

COMMENT:\nHypothesis: \nAre we witness to an increasing probability of a partial breakdown of globalization ? Over the past six months, there have been a number of events that - standing alone - do not provide sufficient justification for a NATO member to invoke Article 4. However, when one combines the totality of near encroachments, border line issues &, generally pervasive attitude of distrust on both sides, a clear trend is taking place.  Attached self explanatory. 13/7/16 NATO - Russia Council ( NRC) meeting will also have \"permanent representatives\" in attendance. Whether the meeting goes beyond, the parameters set out ( close call encounters b/w Russian & Western aircraft over the Baltic) is open to speculation.  This mornings news follows, interesting developments recently. The NATO maneuvers in Poland. The German more conciliatory message to avoid saber-rattling discussion.  This past week, Turkey & Russia attempting to re-establish relations w/ Turkish apologies for aircraft shooting incident on the one hand  & lifting Russian travel bans to Turkey on the other hand.  Lots of recent CROSS CURRENTS.  A thankful move, at least,  for Russians who enjoy Belek vacations &, Turkish tourism in desperate need of tourism post the recent terrorism in Turkey.  It's impossible to get inside Putin's head reference his  actions that led to sanctions in the Ukraine & Crimea in the first instance. Syria is exemplary of how he can maneuver nonetheless on the geopolitical stage. Successfully for his particular Interests.  Staying in power is certainly a Putin major objective. That said, there  still a deep distrust that works both ways - NATO & Russia.  I had to nudge - myself -  to recall that Russia was in the 1990s, a truly tortuous land. A dark period. Being Russian, & recalling this close to depression & lawless period, one has a very real bias for more control. Strength of the state vs weakness & lawlessness.  That said, Russians have also not been \"informed\" of the expansion of member states to the EU. Which obviously includes a NATO related expansion. Post BREXIT, & the ongoing misguided punditry discussion of EU breakup scenarios, such discussion simply adds momentum to Putins underling thesis that \" THE EU has been a bankrolled\" process for some nations & \"a bankrupt\" process for other Member states. FURTHER, EU instability can only play POSITIVELY towards Putins hand and, should not be under-estimated.  It isn't enough to convince the Russian voter today that EU expansion is a good thing for him. And, Putin takes advantage of this process.  Am leaning heavily towards increasing my probability as more circumstantial evidence is \"allowed to drip\" though to the public.  Date: 2.

So, what I'm saying is that it might very well be France that triggers this question, but under this scenario we'd probably need to see the Arabs first deploy and then the French make some announcement as to accompaniment.

It CAN afford to take actions that might limit supply (escalation in war that threatens Iraq/Syria output).   It has a long-term strategy of degrading the NATO promise (attack on one is attack on all) to defend by micro-agressions too small to cause the supposedly promised military response but gradually escalating in size.  But that risky strategy is less in play when the price of oil is low.  Russia invaded Georgia as the oil price peaked at $125.  The oil price had a 30% runup over 12 months before Russia invaded Crimea and Donbass in 2014.  Now oil is at $33.  This is a drop of $1B per day and the GDP is $7B per day.

I think there's a high risk Russia may take action against a Turkish jet, naval vessel or personnel on ground assisting Syrian Turkmen. I think Putin correctly judges that he could get away with one instance of such action and both Obama and European NATO members would simply call for calm and no escalation. Most NATO members seem to really think it was a mistake for Turkey to have shot down the Russian jet and I think they would not react with force if only a Turkish jet, vessel or small group of soldiers were killed. Obama is coming to the end of his presidency that was supposed to be defined by stopping wars and engaging with adversaries with diplomacy. Putin's power base is largely nationalistic with elements of  \"reexpansionism\" to former soviet borders and military bases (i.e. E Europe, C Asia and Arctic). After seeing their airman bloodied on the ground surrounded by Turkmen, the Russian public wants and Putin needs for his power base a single act of revenge.

Turkey and Russia's position in Syria remain at odds with one another, and both countries are led by \"strongmen\" leaders. The other occasion on which Article 4 has been invoked in the past five years was by Poland, in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. The coming to power of a more nationalistic, and frankly paranoid, and strongly anti-Russian, government in Poland is also worth noting: any actions taken by Russia, in non-NATO member states, that may be regarded as a potential threat to European/Western security, could reasonably expect some kind of response from the NATO states of Eastern and Central Europe, and perhaps Poland above all. (Provocations directly involving the Baltic States do not fall into this category: as they are all NATO members, Article 5 would be the appropriate response - with severe, military consequences.).   A stepping up of military basing in the Russian Baltic Exclave of Kaliningrad (something that has been \"threatened\" - and partly implemented - on numerous occasions) might fit the criteria that might result in Article 4 being invoked by the most strongly anti-Russian NATO states, Poland and Lithuania (both of which neighbour the territory).  Alternatively, an upsurge of violence in the Donbass - or the unfreezing of the conflict in Transnistria, or Russian subversion in Moldova proper (which cannot be ruled out: Russia has being building up its support, quite blatantly, in the Moldovan autonomous territory of Gagauzia in recent years - which almost unanimously approved a referendum in support of joining Russia's Eurasian Union, in preference to the European Union: while the Moldovan Government is weak, seemingly perpetually unstable (one former Prime Minister currently under arrest, one forced to resign - on the slightly spurious grounds that he had forged his high school graduation certificate, one recently removed from  office in a vote of no confidence ....), while a financial scandal (involving the theft of a substantial quantity of banking assets) has further weakened state credibility.  Large-scale anti-Government protests in Montenegro recently too, in response against that country's plans to join NATO in the near future. Russia may or may not have been directly involved in those, but at the moment (perhaps: on past form, just for the moment), the Russian state media is working overtime to portray the situation in Montenegro in the worst possible light - seemingly part of its policy (modified beyond its \"near abroad\"), seen in Armenia and Ukraine, to force countries to choose whether to align themselves with Russia or with the West (NATO and/or the EU). Renewed tensions within Georgia - more likely over South Ossetia than the rather more complex and multifaceted situation in Abkhazia - provide another potential trigger-point.

Military personnel (active and reserve) in both Turkey (1m) and Poland (635k) is significant whilst that in Bulgaria (300k) and Romania (150k). The invocation of Article 4 would unlikely be motivated by a genuine military threat against any of these nations by Russia. Instead, it is more likely that Article 4, which triggers a gathering of all NATO member states, would be used to as an opportunity to re-affirm international opinion against Russia's actions in Ukraine and, in doing so, solidify support for the maintenance of the sanctions against Russia. A politically-inspired, rather than militarily motivated invocation, is therefore plausible.

The '*' are recent examples of such.  *December 2011 - mid 2013 their were street protests over blatant parliamentary election rigging & the prospect of another decade of Putin. -> Russia responds by branding much of civil society as \"foreign agents\", claiming the USA (specifically Hillary Clinton) is encouraging domestic unrest, and removing most independent journalism. Directly quoting Putin: \"our people do not want the situation in Russia to develop like it was in Kyrgyzstan or not so long ago in Ukraine.\" That statement was sometime around the beginning of 2012.  *February 2014 Kiev protests begin to take root over the idea that Ukraine is moving away from Europe and towards Russia. Think of how dangerous this is to Putin; if the Ukrainian people can successfully overthrow a rotten government and impose a government capable of moving Ukraine towards a western standard of social freedom and economic success the Russian population will think they can too. Hence Russia seeks to fuck up Ukraine as much as they can get away with so the next time Russians are angry at their government they say \"look what happened to Ukraine after revolution\" instead of \"look how far Ukraine has come since revolution.\" *June 2014 - December 2014 the price of oil begins its slide taking the Russian economy with it. Ukraine is fighting back harder than Russia expected after Crimea was yielded so easily. Enough Russian military mothers are asking why their son was killed in \"training accident\". The world is giving Russia the cold shoulder. Russia needs a new yarn to spin and starts eyeing Syria as a useful easy substitute for Ukraine without as much baggage.  The point I want to make is that Putin isn't planning this. The actions of Russia are not apart of some grand geopolitical master plan to bring the USSR roaring back. If you look under the hood the Russian state is far more fragile than it appears and Putin is reacting to each threat as it presents itself from a short term, self preservation mindset. Over the long run a lawless region in Ukraine along the Russian boarder is not good for Russia. Murdering your neighbors is not good for Russia. Giving NATO a renewed purpose is not good for Russia. Long lasting economic sanctions are not good for Russia. Getting mixed up in a Syrian civil war is not good for Russia. Giving Islamic extremists plenty of reason to attack Russia is not good for Russia. Spending money the state can't afford on military excursions is not good for Russia. Since retaking the presidency in 2012 what has Putin done to improve the quality of life for Russian citizens? Nothing because that takes second hat to his political survival.  The answer to the article 4 question is entirely dependent on the domestic side of Russian politics. If suicide bombers start exploding in Dagestan and Moscow then Putin will need to distract the people again. If the ruble to dollar exchange rate goes to 80 then Putin will need to distract the people again. I see oil remaining cheap for most of 2016 providing no economic relief to Russia. If Russia subdues the Syrian rebels then it will be islamic state verse Assad/Russia. Hence I think the chances of Putin needing a distraction are rather high and therefore will instigate something. I doubt with Estonia or Latvia because NATO. Most likely with Turkey over some Syrian bullshit. But overall if/when Putin needs to stir something up he can turn popular anger against the already marginalized muslims in Russia or send troops to one of the stan nations to \"combat terrorists\" or whatever. \n"], [9145, "2015-11-03T22:47:45Z", [0.35], "Putin's testing us and thinks we're weak."], [10392, "2015-11-03T22:43:25Z", [0.16], "1.

Most of what I have read has been concern that with this stronger hand he would go after the Kurdish rebels but I have a hunch he could also use it to go after the Russians.
