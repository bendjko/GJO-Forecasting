Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch already weighed in when they indicated they would have denied the cert petition and allowed Alabama to proceed with the execution. If Chief Justice Roberts were to agree with them, it would be 4-4 and the lower court decisions would stand and Madison would be executed. A 4-4 split does not seem like a very appetizing way for the Court to decide the life or death of a human being, irrespective of the underlying crime. Roberts allowed a 4-4 split in a 2016 executions, but so far as I can tell that was on a cert petition challenging the method of execution (the drugs used) as opposed to whether the person was competent. In addition, the Madison case is now before the court on the merits. While possible, a 4-4 split allowing an execution to go forward seems unlikely unless he believes strongly that Madison is competent to the executed. Roberts tries to seek consensus where he can and avoids ties if possible. As the tie breaker, then, he will need to decide whether there was sufficient evidence established by the lower court to determine whether Madison is competent to be executed. Roberts established in the oral arguments that this was the gist of the case for him--he is not as focused on whether Madison can remember his crime; rather he is focused on whether Madison can now understand what is about to happen to him. That debate at oral argument turned on whether dementia was sufficient to meet the incompetence standard. Thus, Roberts has 4 choices: (1) dementia doesn't count as incompetence and Madison can be executed--seems unlikely given the gist of questioning and recognition that dementia is an emerging area/issue for aging inmates, (2) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and under the facts of the case Madison's dementia meets the definition for incompetence, (3) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and under the facts of the case Madison's dementia doesn't meet the definition incompetence (5%), or (4) dementia counts, depending on the degree/facts of the dementia to understand the circumstances of one's execution, and the lower court's decision doesn't clearly establish the facts enough to decide that on appeal and that the case needs to be remanded for further assessment by the district court. This last choice may be the best for Roberts, because as a practical matter, it stops the execution while remanding the case for further proceedings in light of guidance around dementia as a test for incompetence (something the Court does need to address as the population of death row inmates continues to age). It also avoids having the perception that the court is making the determination about his competence based on dementia without first hearing specifically about this from the lower court one way or the other. See, for example, the analysis at http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/10/argument-analysis-a-narrow-victory-possible-for-death-row-inmate-with-dementia. It didn't seem as if Roberts pushed the issue about whether Madison was competent/incompetent because of dementia, probably, I think, because it wasn't clear to him from the record whether the lower courts provided sufficient findings to determine that. Unless he can point to specific, concrete findings in the record that gives him comfort that a 4-4- tie is ok, it seems more likely that he could comfortably remand the case for further proceedings. Thus Roberts, will likely want the case remanded, but with some guidance/clarification on dementia and its interplay around the assessment of incompetence. Allowing for some wiggle room because I haven't reviewed the underlying court's findings of fact, I'll give it an 80% probability of a remand or other ruling favorable to Madison."], [39781, "2018-12-16T13:41:09Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-12-16T08:14:35Z", [0.54], ""], [63311, "2018-12-15T01:40:48Z", [0.4], ""], [63213, "2018-12-14T15:09:00Z", [0.1], ""], [30194, "2018-12-13T19:02:02Z", [0.15], ""], [4718, "2018-12-13T18:33:50Z", [0.33], "Likeliest vote is 5/4 NOT to block.

From looking at the Brief of respondent State of Alabama filed in July 2018, an argument proposed by the lower courts point in the direction of holding Madison responsible for his crime. This argument states that although Madison may not have memory (due to the series of strokes) of the crime he committed, he still has a rational understanding of the crime and its consequences. Thus they state that \"a murderer's inability to remember his crime does not render him incompetent to be executed\" (21) (https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-7505/56028/20180731143532610_Brief%20of%20Respondent.pdf).
