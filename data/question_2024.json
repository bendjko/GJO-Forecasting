There has been no fall of that absolute or relative magnitude in such a short period of time since June 2020, when testing was just getting going. Similarly, seeing deaths >3000 would require a rise in the CFR from 2.09% on 6/24 to >3.00% on 7/3. A rise of that absolute or relative magnitude in such a short period of time has also not been seen since June 2020 - and moreover, a value > 3.0% has not been seen since June 2020 and was an artifact of low testing rates back then. It's not inconceivable that Delta or some subsequent variant could turn out to be much more deadly than Alpha, but right now, nearly all deaths are from Alpha and other strains.

Updating scenarios I'm considering:\nWorst-case scenario: 7-day average of cases/day on June 12 is 20k (increasing), and the \"7-day CFR\" is 1.7% (what was seen with ancestral strains before vaccinations). Deaths for the week ending July 3 = 20k * 7 * 0.017 = 2380.\nBest-case scenario: 9k * 7 * 0.009 = 567\nMore plausible scenario: 15k * 7 * 0.0145 = 1523\nIf we say the 7-day CFR won't go below 1.2%, because it hasn't since May 25 (but it's still possible), then the 7-day average of cases on June 12 would need to be <11.9k for deaths to stay <1000. That's still possible but is looking less likely.\nBecause cases may be growing and more deadly variants are spreading, I'm adding a substantial possibility of the third bin. I'm not sure what's going on with cases right now, beyond the fact that it's Air-Conditioning Season in the South and Southwest, and the Delta variant (first seen in India, and increases the risk of hospitalization by 2.57x compared to the Alpha strain (first found in the UK)) is headed towards becoming dominant in the US by sometime in July. That could increase the CFR beyond my worst case scenario, because most deaths are in unvaccinated people; the effects of the Delta strain are just starting to be felt. However, it's not clear what the CFR of the Delta variant is at this point; some data suggest that the Delta CFR might be 2x that of ancestral strains. Also, we have too few data at this point to know the efficacy of different vaccines in protecting from death due to infection with the Delta variant, although it is likely high (although 1 dose appears to offer only ~30% protection from symptomatic infection). Need to watch closely.\nhttps://twitter.com/joaquinlife/status/1402016011142909967\nAlso note that Rt for the Delta variant has been estimated at 1.64 (i.e., spreading much faster than Covid spread in any state in the US last winter) in the UK a month ago. While >50% of the population has had at least one vaccine dose, a substantial fraction of the population still has no immunity. So, even though we're heading into summer in the US, we could still see substantial spread of the Delta variant, and consequently an increase in cases and in the CFR.\nhttps://twitter.com/chrischirp/status/1400390032079347712"], [86554, "2021-06-07T22:03:54Z", [0.23, 0.76, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [100298, "2021-06-07T16:57:07Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [50395, "2021-06-07T10:27:04Z", [0.1, 0.45, 0.4, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-06-07T04:23:36Z", [0.21, 0.43, 0.35, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "I think the consensus aid is right, but I think it's underestimating bin 3."], [79069, "2021-06-06T20:18:26Z", [0.3, 0.6, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Same rationale and opinion but without a couple of errors in calculations, lol - new expected range approx 1,100-1,800, with a bias towards the lower end.\nExpecting deaths to start tracking the drop in case rates (over prior three weeks) more closely, with potential for fluctuations.
