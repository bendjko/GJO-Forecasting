Italy\u2019s largest utility player acquired a controlling stake in a local utility for over $500 million in 2009 from the government owned EPCG, only to lose control in three years. That fiasco has since turned the corner and as of Oct. 15, at least, A2A got its management contract extended for another five years. \"Simply put, it\u2019s not easy doing business in Montenegro and cronyism, lack of transparency, and corruption are the reasons for it. The former Socialist stronghold has become littered with widespread white collar crime. It is a roadblock to Dukanovic\u2019s hopes of joining NATO and, ultimately, the European Union. \"In December, Dukanovic announced that the country would bail out First Bank, one of the country\u2019s largest financial institutions and a major backer in the Montenegrin boom; a boom that was mainly led by Russian investors. First Bank is majority owned by Dukanovic, his two siblings, and a buddy of his. In short, he bailed out himself. \"Members of local watchdog groups, opposition parties, and journalists say this is just another example of the government\u2019s interests aligning with the financial interests of the first family. They say their small country \u2014 fewer than 700,000 people in less space than the state of Connecticut \u2014 is a private corporation run by and for the prime minister and his friends. \"In 2011, Dukanovic was part of the well known Magyar Telecom bribery scheme. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the largest telecommunications provider in Hungary, Magyar, and three of its former top executives with bribing government and politicians in Montenegro in 2005-2006 to win business and shut out competition in the telecommunications industry. According to the SEC, the Hungarian company paid about $9 million through bogus contracts to bribe \u201cat least two government officials\u201d, as well as his sister, a capital city attorney named Ana Kolarevic.In late 2011 Magyar and Deutsche Telekom agreed to pay $95 million to resolve a U.S. criminal investigation into the charges. Even though the charges were dropped against some executives, Magyar still acknowledged it had paid bribes to Dukanovic\u2019s government. \"The Prime Minister was also investigated by the Italian anti-mafia police over allegations that he was involved in a billion-dollar tobacco smuggling ring between 1996 and 2002. Those charges were dropped in 2009 on the grounds of diplomatic immunity. \"Montenegro\u2019s economy is doing well. But its politics are at the risk of becoming a laughing stock. Total legal claims against it are now in excess of 1 billion euros. That\u2019s nearly 30% of the nation\u2019s GDP. \"Unlike any other European country, Dukanovic has run his for the past 25 years. His connections to unsavory business deals could turn him into the latest Ivo Sanader and not the next Lithuania, which become member of the euro family last January and is a very proud member of the NATO family.  Sanader\u2019s shoes are not worth filling. He was the Prime Minister of Croatia before it joined NATO in 2009 and the E.U. in 2013 . He was the second former Yugoslavian state to join the club (Slovenia beat him to it), and wound up in a Croatian prison a little over 8 years later in 2014 for rigging privatization bids. Corruption caught up with him. He\u2019s still in jail. He\u2019s trying to get out. . . . If Sanader is the best rear view in all this, then the shady business deals of Dukanovic will haunt him more than it will hurt Montenegro. Meanwhile, Russian businesses will have to cope with an official anti-Russia sentiment brewing in Dukanovic\u2019s kitchen.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This article fleshes out some of the criticisms about RoL and corruption in Montenegro from the EU report I previously posted."], [38, "2015-11-29T22:54:47Z", [0.11], "http://voiceherald.com/2015/11/29/kosovo-opposition-holds-rally-to-protest-against.html \"The police . . . broke down the doors of the Vetevendosje (Self-Determination) party headquarters and arrested founder . . .

Montenegro. The tiny Adriatic state will hardly strengthen NATOs military capacities, but it has had MAP-status since 2009 \u2013 and peace and stability in the Western Balkans are of crucial importance for Europe. Furthermore, from the perspective of Montenegro and the region in gen\u00aderal, NATO membership does count. Neighbouring Croatia and Albania are already members, whereas other neighbours, as noted above, remain in a somewhat shaky security situation. In addition, economic challenges, unemployment, corruption, social inequality, pressure on the media and con\u00adtinued ethnic tensions still threaten to undermine democratic reforms and stability in the region. And finally, Russian influence appears to be on the rise, aimed at filling any political vacuum left open by the West. In this context, a NATO invitation to Montenegro would be a stabilizing factor and demonstrate that hard work and reform eventually pay off. The Montenegrin authorities hope to get such an invitation at the North Atlantic Council in December this year.\n. . .  Since . . . [the NATO Wales Summit] the Montenegrin authorities have been work\u00ading intensively to deal with all remaining short\u00adcomings, on numerous levels. \"On the practical level, the NATO integration proc\u00adess for countries with MAP status is primarily con\u00adducted through the Annual National Programmes (ANP): annual strategies with clear objectives and milestones in several sectors, defined by the candidate country itself in cooperation with NATO. Montenegro is currently working on the basis of its fifth ANP, presented in Brussels in October 2014. It focuses on four sectors: security sector reform, strengthening RoL, increasing public support for accession to NATO, and continuation of the defence sector reform. The RoL requirements go far beyond the defence sector, and concern issues like corruption, organized crime, money laundering and trafficking. This part of the process is closely associated with Montenegro\u2019s on-going EU nego\u00adtiations in Chapters 23 (Judiciary and fundamen\u00adtal rights) and 24 ( Justice, freedom and security). NATO is likely to look to the EU for assessments of progress here; in addition, the USA has bilater\u00adally demanded concrete steps to be prioritized and implemented, including anti-corruption measures and intelligence reform. \"Among Montenegro\u2019s main internal challenges is the muted public support for NATO membership. The population is split: one third in favour, one third against and one third undecided, with the battle primarily over the latter third. Those who are opposed to NATO membership tend to be people who identify themselves as Serbs, and those with particular negative experience of the 1999 NATO bombing which also hit Montenegro, albeit in a limited way. But no realistic alternative to NATO is on the agenda, and according to some polls a majority of the population believe that the country will eventually join NATO, irrespective of their per\u00adsonal views. The authorities have aimed at getting more than 50% support for membership, but this has proven difficult. The latest polls show about 40%, despite massive campaigning. NGOs have criticized the authorities for conducting a boring and unengaging campaign. . . . should the authorities fail in these efforts, NATO countries that are cur\u00adrently reluctant to enlargement may become even more sceptical. \"At the end of the day however, the decision to invite Montenegro or not is a political one. The formal requirements are tougher than in previous rounds, but there are no formal lists of targets or criteria to be fulfilled \u2013 nor is there any automatic invitation if certain measures are implemented. Most observ\u00aders regard the Montenegrin defence sector as being \u2018sufficiently\u2019 reformed to be approved for mem\u00adbership, although continued efforts are needed \u2013 indeed, as in NATO itself. Within the Alliance it is particularly the neighbouring countries that have been promoting Montenegro\u2019s candidacy. Also Serbia is said to be positive. As usual, it is France that has expressed greatest scepticism towards enlargement,[5] while the USA, the UK and Germany now appear supportive of Montenegro\u2019s bid. The remainder of the 28 NATO countries have a more passive stance, but some seem to express certain concerns regarding Montenegro\u2019s RoL status. \"However, the fact that Montenegro (in contrast to, for instance, Serbia) has signed up to the EU sanctions against Russia certainly also weighs in positively in most Western capitals \u2013 in Washing\u00adton DC in particular. Given the significant Russian investments in Montenegrin coastal properties, the sanctions may prove costly for Montenegro\u2019s cru\u00adcial tourism industry this season. These Russian investments are generally not applauded in Mon\u00adtenegro, as they tend to be associated with money laundering and have contributed only modestly to the modernization of the industry itself. There are also rumours that Russian money is financing the two anti-NATO campaigns in Montenegro and that they are involved in a recent bizarre claim from neighbouring Bosnia to a part of the Montenegrin coastline.[6] It has also been claimed that events at the recent scandalous football match between Montenegro and Russia, adjourned due to the anti-Russian behaviour of Montenegrin fans, were staged by the secret service in Montenegro. Such conspiracy theories are typical of the region, but there can be little doubt that there is indeed a par\u00adallel struggle over NATO taking place behind the scenes. \"Another challenge for Montenegro is its limited achievements as regards democracy. Several inde\u00adpendent institutions have been established and strengthened in recent decades, but the politi\u00adcal and economic elite have remained the same for the past 20 years. Prime Minster Djukanovic, often called the \u2018political survivor of the Western Balkans\u2019, is controversial internally and interna\u00adtionally for his alleged links to organized crime. Irrespective of the truth of such accusations, the fact that the same people have governed the coun\u00adtry for so long is an unhealthy sign in any aspir\u00ading democracy. The Western strategy has been to induce change and reforms through the EU and NATO integration processes, hoping that democ\u00adracy will emerge bottom\u2013up. To date this has proven rather successful, although the uppermost echelons of power have stayed unchanged. \"It seems that Djukanovic is assisted by the erratic behaviour of Putin, which is making it geo-polit\u00adically more important to enlarge and strengthen NATO to face up to Russia than to putting contin\u00adued pressure on reform in Montenegro. As one US diplomat put it: before Ukraine we were asking: why enlargement? Now we ask: why not? Further\u00admore, the recent events in Macedonia demonstrate how dangerous a stalled integration and reform process could be, and also how Russia may seek to exploit this to its own ends. [7] Still, one cannot rule out that an invitation to Montenegro from North Atlantic Council in December will be conditional on continued reforms before the Warsaw Summit in July 2016.[8] It remains up to each and every one of NATO\u2019s 28 members to support an invita\u00adtion. But unless the Montenegrin government completely fails to swing the domestic mood, or fails to convince NATO that is has delivered on its reforms, Montenegro is more likely than not to be invited to join NATO at the upcoming Summit.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The next thing I'm going to research is the EU Commission report on Montenegro,  chapters 23 & 24: RoL."], [12118, "2015-11-28T22:09:32Z", [0.99], ""], [43, "2015-11-28T21:16:55Z", [0.85], "Losing my nerve on the basis of the unanimity issue.

Part of the opposition was disappointed about the European Commission\u2019s review of the protests...The EU has recognised our county's democratic capacity to resolve all disputes within the system. The lack of support for a boycott of the Parliament was expected. The trap lies precisely in the fact that EU intervention would be equivalent to the application of the balance clause.

This is a strategic point in the Balkans, a large bay. The entrance to this bay is territorially still controlled by Montenegro. But if the second cape goes to Croatia by territorial dispute, and Croatia is a NATO member, then in practice the entrance to the large bay will be controlled by two countries. The territorial dispute will move to another level. Previously, Montenegro owned the cape and Croatia claimed it, and now it could turn out to be the opposite way.

Comparison class: Ukraine rejected Russia's Eurasian Union, rioters spooked Yanukovich into fleeing with his ill-gotten billions, new leaders announced intention to join the EU. How did that work out? OTOH, with Russia focusing on Syria and giving Ukraine somewhat of a respite, perhaps this is a window of opportunity to join NATO without a disastrous pushback aided by little green men. On the third hand, right now, Russia is continuing to push forward its border between Georgian and the Russian-occupied South Ossetia region, and regularly kidnapping Georgians and holding them in their military bases for ransom. Georgia has begged NATO to let them join without any luck so far. Power players: So, here's what I think NATO leaders might be thinking. It would be nice to deny Russia an Adriatic naval base. If NATO is sufficiently determined, they may be willing to rush to Montenegro's aid  to prevent a new version of Moldivo's Transdinestra, Georgia's South Ossetia and Ukraine's Crimea and Donbas. Right now, with Syria at the top of Russia's deployment of military resources, this might be the best time in years to add Montenegro to NATO. But are they willing to do an Article 5 level rescue of Montenegro? NATO is only giving symbolic support to Georgia (Obama's infamous \u201creset\u201d) and Ukraine. If NATO waits for a more hawkish U.S. President, it would be more likely to support Montenegro. Failure to respond to an Article 5 from a NATO member Montenegro would be disastrous. Is NATO ready and willing to get into a shooting war with Russia? How likely do NATO members see such an outcome? Wildcard: NATO leaders might be contemplating what if Montenegro joins NATO, and Russia pulls a Syria on them. Not just little green men and lots of deniability all around. My take: It would be so easy for NATO to tell Montenegro that they are doing well, but put off a decision, and put it off\u2026 This would Send A Message to their voters that they are Standing Up To Russia without having to send soldiers home in caskets. Probability: 10% Dateline 11-11-15 Leaders of nine states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states published a joint statement on Wednesday, in which they expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about \u201cthe aggressive position\u201d of Russia and stood for a stable presence of NATO in the region, the Voice of America reports. The joint declaration which they adopted in Bucharest stated that the leaders would unite efforts to provide \u201ca full-scale, effective, and regular\u201d military presence of NATO in the region. Russia views NATO expansion highly negatively for several reasons. Sergey Markov, director of the Institute of Political Studies, says that \u201cthe accession of Montenegro to NATO does not strengthen the security of NATO if we regard the objectives of NATO as they are declared \u2013 the security of countries from outside aggression. Montenegro is already integrated into NATO to some extent. The alliance transferred Montenegro to its standards: they trained officers there for a long time; they can obtain permission for flights at any time. But NATO's policy is for Montenegro to join NATO. The objective of NATO is to ensure domination, through the use of absolute power superiority, of the countries of the Anglosphere \u2013 the US, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands. We are talking about the political unification of all the other countries, which includes the processes of de-Russification.\u201d http://vestnikkavkaza.net/articles/Nine-states-stand-for-stable-presence-of-NATO-in-Eastern-Europe-and-Baltic-Region.html"], [24, "2015-11-11T13:08:00Z", [0.55], "Increasing forecast into the positive zone, largely in response to two things.\nFirst, this http://www.cdm.me/english/croatia-claims-montenegro-will-receive-nato-invitation-in-december\n\"Croatia is convinced that a consensus will be reached at the forthcoming ministerial meeting and that Montenegro will receive invitation for membership in NATO in December, said the Croatian Ambassador to Montenegro Ivana Peric-Sutlic during a meeting with Minister without portfolio Marija Vucinovic.\" OK, this is still tenuous and indefinite, and not from a major power-player to another power-player. But on the other hand, it is from an interested party in the region, and from one that has, in the relatively recent past, been through the accession process itself. The second factor, which may be more important, is the wave of anti-NATO (and, in effect anti-Montenegrin) propaganda that the Russian state media have been putting out in recent weeks - a global, multi-lingual effort. (The Sputnik website provides numerous examples).  If anything , rather than stalling NATO expansion into Montenegro, I reckon this is more likely to expedite it, despite substantive concerns about rule of law, corruption (but still - Romania got in long ago, and has only belatedly, and subsequently, really started to get grip on such matters) .....

The last place in which Russia led substantive anti-NATO campaigns was in Crimea - and what happened there in subsequent years is well known.

Will the candidate country enhance NATO security? To answer the first question, in September the parliament of Montenegro adopted a symbolic resolution supporting the country\u2019s integration into NATO. About two thirds of the Montenegrin Parliament \u2013 50 out of 79 \u2013 voted in favor of the resolution, supported by the ruling coalition, signaling the country\u2019s readiness to join NATO. However, those who opposed the resolution insist that it is not up to the parliament to make such a historic decision, and that the majority of the country\u2019s population has opposed NATO membership. Some MPs spoke out to suggest a referendum on the issue of the NATO integration. However, the majority may consider NATO membership as a sure avenue to decreased Serbian and Russian meddling in domestic politics: NATO membership would make Putin think twice about political involvement in Montenegro. In the general public, it remains difficult to read opinion. Anti-government protests have broken out, but each side points fingers at the other of falsifying numbers and polls: the pro-NATO camp alleges that Russia is behind the anti-NATO opinion, and the anti-NATO camp accuses the government of inflating the public sentiment towards NATO. Opinions about NATO membership remain hotly divided in Montenegro. The population is split into thirds, with one third for membership, one third against, and the remaining third undecided. Many of the country\u2019s sizeable Serbian community remain angry over NATO\u2019s bombing campaign in Serbia during the 1990s that was aimed at forcing Belgrade to withdraw from Kosovo. Several opposition politicians, mostly from pro-Serbian parties, joined the anti-NATO rally. Protesters sang famous Russian songs and carried banners declaring that \u2018Kosovo is the heart of Serbia\u2019.

Its inclusion would be a calibrated signal that NATO hopes to plug gaps, without making any overly aggressive moves. Enhancement to NATO would not be in terms of real military strength, but rather, it would be a political symbolic gesture. Geopolitically, inclusion of Montenegro does shore up the Adriatic coast, just as feasibility studies are about to get underway for the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline, designed to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil.  Furthermore, the inclusion of Montenegro can send a signal to future countries, and to Russia, that all nations have the capacity to join the alliance as long as they make requisite reforms and demonstrate true willingness to put in the hard work to reach NATO standards.

See the comparison class of the Transdinestra in Moldova, which, although not a NATO member, cooperates closely. If it didn't have Russian troops occupying its Transdinistria region, it probably would get to join. But there is the rub. Even though, like Montenegro, Moldova has no border with Russia, its population is strongly pro-Russia. Also like Montenegro, Russia has no land route to supply its troops in Transdinistria. However, Russia is supporting them via air, and nobody is enthusiastic about getting into a shooting war with Russia over this.  In the case of Montenegro, supplying Little Green Men, and, later, official Russian forces would be trivial, given Montenegro's two Mediterranean ports. So my analysis has been that making Montenegro a NATO member would result in destabilizing Montenegro, potentially leading to NATO having to defend it against Little Green Men, and soon. Worse, this might galvanize the Serbs, who still remember the death and destruction of NATO's air strikes against them in 1999. If the pro-Russian politicians win the next elections, what next? A Russian naval base in the Adriatic? Yet, yet... many of the top forecasters are going high on the probability that NATO is motivated to give Russia the middle finger. If NATO could pull this off, if Putin decides, oh, well, you guys win, I'll just take my marbles home and pout, this would be quite the coup.

As others have pointed out as well, diplomacy with Russia may actually be a consideration, even if NATO denies this. The wording of the question is a major point here as well. It says \"invite\", not \"ratify\". Based on the info on NATO's website, I believe this is talking about step 3 in the process: \"Accession protocols are signed by NATO countries\". I don't know if that means that the decision has to be unanimous among members or not. The ratification process looks like it has to be unanimous, which is what has stalled Macedonia's accession (i.e. Greece refuses to accept them). It isn't clear to me that either step 3 or 4 are what the question refers to as an \"invite\" though, nor what precisely will cause this question to close. The tl;dr here:  a) I don't see any way this can be ratified this year.

One of the reasons that there was NATO and KFOR involvement, and war, in the former Yugoslavia was because Yugoslavia was a weak flank.  It borders the former Warsaw Pact countries and NATO regions and a center in Europe is only as strong as its flank. Given that the Balkan region is sometimes less stable it causes more security involvement from Europe. It may not have the same issues it had with the Warsaw Pact, but allowing the region to go off on its own is not prudent if they are asked to support the West.  A resolution is like a promise to an invitation, which is like a pre-approved loan which is like do not shop around until we figure it out.  However, Montenegro could have an offer from NATO to accept a tailored plan to further integrate its policies and training in NATO at a later date, as some of the Balkan nations agreed to accept, since streamline coordination is not always possible in NATO.

HOWEVER!!! I don't understand what the difference is between NATO's invitation to Montenegro to join the alliance back in 1999, and what is meant by \"invite Montenegro to join the alliance before the end of the year.\" According to http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37356.htm, the official NATO website, \"Current participants in the MAP [Membership Action Plan] are the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has been participating in the MAP since 1999, and Montenegro, which was invited to join in December 2009.\" Presumably the author(s) of this question knew about Montenegro having been \"invited to join\" in 1999, so they must want something more. Is the question really \"Will NATO rule that Montenegro has met all the conditions of its MAP before the end of the year, and is hereby cleared to join any time it wants?\" If so, then the comment in the news story below suggests that meeting its MAP goals is going to take considerably more time. As Anneinak has pointed out, public opposition is a likely deal breaker.

So, either they mis-understood what was on the NATO agenda, or they thought that it might resolve positively.   I'm thinking that I should forecast based on what I think will happen at the meeting.  A lot may depend on what kind of public reception NATO officials receive in Montenegro:  if there's riots, all bets are 0!

On part 2, how will GJI interpret what NATO might do?  I think there's about a 50% chance that they will interpret  a recommendation for invitation as an invitation.\nWhat keeps me from being confident is there is the chance that a formal invitation won't be made even if there is a recommendation to.

US statements on the matter have been qualified ( eg  http://www.rferl.org/content/us-ready-invite-montenegro-join-nato/27248715.html )and don't suggest urgency - the question of public support in Montenegro for NATO membership is also important. Although the Montenegro parliament recently made a symbolic vote in favour of NATO membership, the governing coalition holds little more than a bare majority in parliament and is dependent upon ethnic minority parties (Croat and Bosniak), and public opinion is evidently not settled on the matter. (This would also, I think, be the first NATO state to actually have been bombed by NATO - during the Kosovo conflict of 1999)  Most recent (late 2014) edition of \"The Military Balance\" (IISS, London) refers to \"limited military capacity\" of ME armed forces and their limitation to \"relatively undemanding internal security missions\", and also refers to \"maintenance issues.. [affecting] operational availability of equipment\" Counter-claims:\nA full NATO summit meeting is not *necessary* to issue an invitation, other gatherings could permit it. But the timescale is still too short for this to resolve positively. \nMontenegro is a small country - which would make it easier to incorporate than the other post-communist member states (that two of its neighbours are fairly new NATO members helps too). But (apart from symbolic message to adversary Russia, which has strong financial and to some extent cultural, but not so much political ties  - and an additional stretch of Med Coastline) - the advantages to NATO of Montenegrin membership are small. Montenegro has substantially increased its defence expenditure in recent years I still can't see this happening before end 2015, anyway, even under extreme circumstances."]]}
