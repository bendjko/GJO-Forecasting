Biden looks like he's on track to win Michigan and Wisconsin, as they have him leading by about a point with virtually all of the vote in. It's slim enough there that the Trump campaign will challenge it, but I highly doubt they will flip with a recount.  In Pennsylvania, although Trump is currently leading, it seems to me like there's a good chance Biden will win it. Why? Well, comparing the biggest district's results with 2016, they all seem to be doing better for Biden. For example, Northampton, which has 170k votes, has gone +3.8 for Biden even though they went +.4 for Trump in 2016. In Dauphin, Biden's performing 5 points better than Clinton did, and same in Lackawanna. All of these are big districts, and given that Clinton lost by only by .7% in 2016, even if he doesn't improve by this much across the remaining counties, it stands to reason that there's a good chance he will out-perform her by enough to win PA. I'd give him a 75-80% chance there.\nThe NYT needle can help us in Georgia and North Carolina. According to them, Biden has a 63% chance of winning Georgia, and a 14% chance of winning North Carolina. The NYT needle was able to call Florida for Trump very early, so I have pretty high trust in it.\nIn Nevada, it looks like in Clark County, by far the biggest county in Nevada, Biden has outperformed Clinton by 2.7%. Given that she won Nevada by 2.4% in 2016, this seems to imply that he's more than on track to win Nevada as the remaining votes are counted, especially since 16% of Clark County's vote is yet to be counted. In Arizona, AP and Fox have called it for Biden, but the Trump campaign disputes that. That being said, just doing a weighted average of each county and how much Biden outperformed 2016 in them (weighted by number of votes), it seems like he's on track to do ~7 points better margin-wise. Given that Clinton lost AZ by 3.5, that means he's on pace for a 3.5 point victory, which makes me reasonably confident he will win it. Alaska I have nothing to say about, besides that I'm assuming it will go Trump. As of right now, given the information above, it looks like the amount of ways Trump can win are not many. Assuming we're starting off with 217 EVs for Trump (including Alaska and ME-2), the most plausible path to victory at this point for him would be to win Pennsylvania (which would get him up to 237), North Carolina (252), Georgia (268), and then hope to win either AZ, NV, MI or WI, the last two of which look like they're virtually over. This is not a likely path by any means, with his chances of winning PA once all the votes are counted at maybe 25-30%, NC at 86%, and Georgia at 37%, and then having to win either AZ or NV, both of which have maybe a 15% chance of happening. If this were a normal election I would give Trump maybe a 5% chance, but to pre-empt any Supreme Court shenanigans I'll bump it up to 10%.
