The clashes between insurgents, the Malian Army and UN peacekeepers have had relatively low death tolls.  The insurgency is consistently coming from the Northern, Sahara Desert region of Mali.  Keeping a consistent supply chain of fighters, weapons and food by passing through the Sahara Desert will be tough to consistently maintain.
