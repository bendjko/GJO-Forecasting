Over the last month, it closed below 400 once, but generally remained above. Looking further back, however, we can see how volatile the stock really is. Investors appear to move rapidly in and out of Tesla - on 31 August the stock closed at about $500 and barely over a week later it had dropped to $330 (I believe on news that it was not added to the Dow as it was expected to be).  That said, we can see that the price exhibits a generally upward trend and it appears that some of the volatility has begun to even out over the last 1-3 months. We're only three days from close now, so putting my prediction right now, especially after yesterday's addition of Tesla to the S&P, is probably cheating a bit. It's sitting at $444 right his moment (up ~9% over yesterday's close), having gotten as high as about $462. I generally see it settling out right about where it is right now, up about 9% for the day, and then settling back in to a flatter trend over the next three days. All the volatility isn't gone, and we can't put anything past Elon Musk. One tweet could hit the price. However, I believe he'll focus on the current SpaceX mission and recovering from Covid, leaving Tesla to move in a normal fashion. I highly doubt it falls beneath $400. It could fall back to pre-S&P announcement levels, but I doubt it will get there in the next three days, so I don't expect that to happen either. I think the gain from the S&P add will be fully priced in by the end of the day, and it will sit in the range it's at now, right on the edge between the second and third band here. Excluding today's (explained) jump, the biggest change in price over the last 5 days was yesterday, with a still less than 1% change. Assuming the price closes somewhere around where it is now, it will be either just above or just below.
