Actually, a lot of people died during protests. More than in Moscow during the October Revolution of 1917, which started the bloody Civil War.  In 1993, two years after the USSR dissolution, during so called Constitutional Crisis, \"On October 3, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the Ostankino television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of October 4 by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. \nThe ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in Moscow's history since the Russian Revolution.[1] According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis acohen: \"The modern Russian state, while corrupt, is not brutal\" Just imagine - the tanks were firing at the Parliament building right in the center of Moscow. Special forces were firing machine guns at demonstrators (yes, some of them were armed) at Ostankino. \"62 people were killed, including Terry Michael Duncan, an American lawyer, who was in Moscow to establish a law firm and was killed while attempting to help the wounded...Two French, one British and one American journalist were killed by sniper fire during the massacre.\" Let me remind that Putin was hand-picked by Yeltsin (who was the president during the Constitutional crisis) not because Putin has a gentle soul. He brutally suppressed the Chechen bid for independence when tens of thousands died. The only reason that Putin does not use (brutal) force is that he discounts opposition as extremely weak - his ratings are still high and opposition leaders are mostly discredited by the government-controlled media. The moment he perceives them dangerous, it will be blood. Why not - they are already marked as puppets/traitors bought by the US.\nAnd actually, there have been killings - not during protests though - of opposition figures, journalists and alike. Ukraine, with the same roots in the Soviet Union and similar culture, also proves the point - during Maidan (just 5 years ago), more than a hundred people died during protests when the balance of power shifted and was in doubt.
