Polls, esp. online polls, tend to underestimate the conservative vote and the status quo bias. Those same polls also tend to have an unrepresentative sample where turnout--based on various models--is expected to be much higher than in the general population. YouGov at least may have tried to change their panels a little to adjust for that discrepancy but they've used data from general elections to do so which I believe means they're not sufficiently well-calibrated for this referendum. People who are undecided, or say that they don't know how they'll vote, are more likely to vote for the conservative option and/or the status quo, provided they show up at all. These surveys tend to contain a disproportionately high number of responses from politically interested people with strong opinions. The first should indicate a victory for Remain based on the averages of the most recent polls that put the two camps neck and neck, further supported by tendency for most phone polls to show Remain ahead.  One possible problem for remain would be the \"lazy Labour\" problem with young Labour voters who're more likely to be pro-EU being less likely to turn up to vote. I think however that that problem is a consequence of the British electoral system and that a referendum should see a much higher turnout in that group. I believe that overall turnout will be fairly high for the referendum. The previous EU referendum in the UK had a turnout about 5% lower than in the preceding general election in spite of a politically interested electorate. However, I believe several things speak in favour of a higher turnout for this referendum: simple majority, perception of this being a close election, binding/semi-binding and a very important question that affects everyone. One study in Norway showed that, at the local level, semi-binding referendums had higher turnouts of about 11%. I think that's a little too much to expect from this election because Norwegians are odd and because those results may partly reflect the likelihood of semi-binding referendums to be held for more important questions and partly be an artefact of low interest in local referendums in general. At the same time, this is a very high-profile issue so I don't feel comfortable discounting the effect too heavily. We should at minimum be able to expect a turnout over 60%. I'm gonna say 70% likelihood of turnout >/= 65% with my guess being 67% of registered voters. I think I'm more likely to be underestimating turnout than overestimating it. Both sides have run a fairly negative campaign and I've heard that negative campaigns tend to be associated with lower turnout but I'm not persuaded of a causal relationship there."], [5390, "2016-06-22T23:43:24Z", [0.0], ""], [24972, "2016-06-22T23:42:30Z", [0.65], ""], [26357, "2016-06-22T23:42:12Z", [0.53], "Comment deleted on Jun 22, 2016 11:43PM UTC"], [1078, "2016-06-22T23:28:57Z", [0.95], ""], [601, "2016-06-22T23:21:35Z", [0.45], ""], [783, "2016-06-22T23:15:01Z", [0.4], "The referendum on staying is based on jobs and the economy and since many Brits were affected by the economy, I doubt they give a twit on how Square Mile is battered by the exit.

Individual country economies are much more reliant on the global economy than they used to be.  Just look at how even the possibility of Brexit is impacting the US markets.

The currency markets clearly have mispriced an enormous risk, a sterling crisis if Brexit occurs.\nSo there is plenty of room for disagreement.\nSee http://www.wsj.com/articles/markets-ignore-the-brexit-worst-case-scenario-a-sterling-crisis-1466444823\nBy JAMES MACKINTOSH\nMarkets have fixated for the past week on whether Britain is about to vote to leave the European Union. Sterling, the euro, gold, global shares and even the yen have had synchronized swings as the prospects of such a \u201cBrexit\u201d rise and fall ahead of Thursday\u2019s referendum.\nAmid the speculation, little attention has been paid to the core assumptions investors are making. In particular, moves in sterling and in British government bonds, known as gilts, demonstrate a broad belief that the pound\u2019s fall will be pronounced but not catastrophic, and that the Bank of England will ignore any imported inflation.\nInvestors mostly are brushing aside the prospect of a repeat. In the one sterling crash since the Bank of England gained operational independence over monetary policy in 1997\u2014the post-Lehman depreciation when the pound fell by almost one-third\u2014policy makers ignored the inflation which resulted. Instead, they cut interest rates to a record low, where they remain, to support the economy.\nSushil Wadhwani, a former Bank of England policy maker who runs a hedge fund, is concerned that after several years of stability a big fall in the pound could lead to more selling and feed on itself to create a sterling crisis. \u201cThis time round there\u2019s a very good chance it becomes a vicious move [in the pound] at some stage because of the lack of hedging,\u201d he said. If a fall in the pound turns into a downward spiral, the Bank of England could appeal to foreign central banks to help. But coordinated intervention would surely require the Bank of England to raise rates to help support sterling, too. This would be an extreme outcome, a true loss of confidence in the U.K. Even those who worry about it think it unlikely, just not as unlikely as markets suggest. :A handful of very small bets have been placed in the options market which would profit immensely from such a sterling crisis. The biggest was placed in April, an option with a face value of $100 million which would be in the money if the pound falls below 95 cents next month, from $1.46 on Monday. The previous record low was $1.05, hit in 1985 amid a crisis which forced the Bank of England to lift rates from 9.5% to 13.875% within a month to keep sterling above parity with the dollar\" So  no way  sterling will collapse to 1.05. I hope.\nIf Leave passes  sterling will be down 10% and with much blood on the floor. Programmed  high frequency trading may take it down more.\n  Which is why I feel certain that Brexit will not occur.  '\nand all my forex positions closed. I am in cash.\nDamage to my Brier is enough to motivate me  to be on target here.\nWe shall see if the pound is mispriced in short order.  \""], [13377, "2016-06-21T03:36:43Z", [0.85], ""], [13365, "2016-06-21T02:44:12Z", [0.94], ""], [12745, "2016-06-21T02:25:18Z", [0.9], ""], [12745, "2016-06-21T02:11:41Z", [0.55], ""], [61, "2016-06-21T01:42:25Z", [0.82], "up a bit on recent polls"], [10898, "2016-06-21T01:36:24Z", [0.8], ""], [601, "2016-06-21T00:36:12Z", [0.75], ""], [180, "2016-06-21T00:31:35Z", [0.48], ""], [11329, "2016-06-21T00:18:51Z", [0.57], ""], [25915, "2016-06-21T00:14:34Z", [0.88], ""], [21758, "2016-06-20T23:50:05Z", [0.98], ""], [21758, "2016-06-20T23:47:30Z", [1.0], ""], [26267, "2016-06-20T23:44:31Z", [0.99], "Status quo.

I took an unweighted average of these polls and got remain=43.73%, leave=45.59%, and undecided=9.95%. If we assume that all undecided voters either stay home or break for \"remain\" in the same numbers as the rest of the population, then this translates into a 37% of \"remain\" winning.  But there's some reason to think they *wouldn't* break this way. The average percentage of voters who identify as \"undecided\" in a \"remain\" victory is 11.75%, while the average percentage of voters who identify as \"undecided\" in a \"leave\" victory is 9.4%. Likewise, variance is much lower (2.8%) for \"remain\" than for both \"leave\" (3.7%) and \"undecided\" (4.1%). All of this suggests that the group of voters who vacillate between \"undecided\" and \"remain\" is smaller than the group of voters who can't make up their minds between \"undecided\" and \"leave.\" That's bad news for europhiles. I know what you're thinking: High-level generalizations about these polls ignores the different modalities of these polls (Internet vs. phone vs. face-to-face) as well as the questions used, the quality of the pollsters asking the questions, etc. That's all true. And yet: 37%.  In the teeth of this mighty wind, Bloomberg's Brexit tracker is back up to 63% for \"remain\"[2]; PredictWise puts \"remain\" at 75% and climbing[3], and BetFair gives the UK a little more than a 76% of staying[4]. I'm inclined to defer somewhat to what I take to be better informed voices, but I have to admit that if I didn't think that leaving the EU would be a catastrophe for my unofficial home-away-from-home, then I would probably be far less inclined to do so. It is worth noting that one of the groups that strongly favors \"leave\" is the poor (as defined by The Economist, not me)[5], and there's a long history in both the US and the UK of less affluent voters being underrepresented at the polls[6]. In contrast, the rich (again, as defined by The Economist) favor \"remain\" by more than a 3-to-1 margin. That said, the elderly strongly favor \"leave,\" and they're more likely to vote than the young who favor \"remain\" in roughly equal numbers[7]. This is especially true of ancient UKIPers[8].

Through out the referendum the polls have bounced around and ten days ago they were predicting that the Leave campaign had inched ahead for the first time by as much as ten points.  However throughout this referendum, the bookies have been firmly in favor of the Remain campaign winning.  In recent UK elections, polls have been wrong. Most notably in the 2015 General Election, pollsters were predicting that the Labour Party would win, but the actual result was a resounding victory for the Conservatives.  The general reason for this disparity has been attributed to the fact that people lied when polled as they were ashamed they were voting for the Conservatives (widely perceived to be the nasty party).  The same thing happened in the 1992 elections in the UK.  When people went into the voting cubicles last year, they decided to vote for less tax - despite the fact this meant greater austerity to the country.  The polls of the EU referendum have been confusing. They have mostly been in favor of the Remain campaign, but then began to swing in favor of Leave. I believe this is because Leave campaigners are very keen to get their voice heard. Remain campaigners are simply less motivated.  However, like last year in the general election I believe that when people go into the voting booths - they will vote remain as the status quo remains acceptable, the fear of the unknown will be too daunting.  In the last few days the assassination of a sitting Member of Parliament, by a right wing individual who proclaimed to want to put Britain First - an organisation campaigning for Leave  - has had a significant affect on the mood in the country. Coupled with blatant xenophobia if not down right racism displayed by members of the leave campaign,  has left confusion in the ranks of the Leave prompting some high profile defections. Many have been turned off.  Some believe that England's performance in the Euro 2016 football competition may lead to increased Nationalism if they go through to the next round on the 20th. And increase the chance of a leave vote. As English nationalists are most in favor of Leaving.

I wrote last time that there was risk of circularity in ignoring the polls and looking at the betting odds, as the bookmakers were also ignoring the polls and all of us were looking at Scottish referendum as the playbook for how the vote would turn out.  The tragic death of Jo Cox has certainly placed Remain in the winning position, witnessed by the swing in the polls back to Remain after the weekend.  I also noted before that in a fairly large, self-confident country like the UK, political campaigns needed to balance hope and fear issues.  A fear-only campaign can work in Scotland but not in the UK as a whole.  The Leave camp had nostalgia of \"sovereignty\" and old empire and the fear of unlimited \"immigration\", while Remain was unbalanced with only the fear issue of \"economy recession\", however with this terrible event last week, I believe the Remain camp has been able to catalyse its positive message.  This has been confirmed by David Cameron recent positive stance as well as his tweet of Jo Cox's final op-ed about the benefits of EU immigration for the UK.  Considering this was an issue Remain would not try rebut but reassure in public, I sense they are more confident of the mood of the majority in the wake of her death.   There has been a blistering  critique in the pro Leave press about any the use of Ms Cox's name or death during the rest of the campaign, but politics is a messy business about messaging.   The Vote Remain camp would argue to ignore and blank out her death would be equally demeaning for what she had been campaigning for and what she stood for \"pro-immigration\" and \"pro-EU\".   In politics, seminal events matter.  The UK is a secular, liberal society in the large political \"middle\" and I assume that is where the undecideds live.  The undecideds should swing to Remain more decisively as the implicit, anti-minority principles of the right wing elements within the Leave Vote are highlighted more vigorously in the press.  There is also a crescendo of business leaders and groupings of scholars/\"experts\" like Noble Laureate economists' open letter coming out in the past few days for UK to stay in EU.   In addition and probably more important, publications like the Times and Economist which are typically critical of the EU have come out for Remain.  (I think Rupert Murdoch is hedging his bets).  What is interesting about this activity of the Remain supporters is that its all coming out nearer to the actual poll date whether by design or in reaction to the previous weak polls.  One forecaster wrote presciently when up weighting his forecast precisely when polls had swung to Leave, stating and I paraphrase, the weak polls for Remain will reinvigorate campaign and create a sense of urgency for voter turnout supporting Remain which was one of the significant risks, an apathetic voting block."], [25345, "2016-06-20T09:26:27Z", [0.55], "Comment deleted on Jun 20, 2016 09:33AM UTC"], [26039, "2016-06-20T09:19:53Z", [0.92], ""], [26183, "2016-06-20T09:14:06Z", [0.85], "Bump towards remain based on polls over the last few days, and prominent Brexit campaigners abandoning ship.

The murder of Ms. Cox makes the prospects even worse. If \"Remain\" loses, it will still consider \"Leave\" as being somehow complicit in the assassination, and if \"Leave\" loses, it will consider its position to have been unfairly tainted by a crime that has nothing to do with its policy prescriptions.

(1) There have been numerous unsubstantiated, and in some cases, blatantly false, attempts by elements in the media, and also from a few pro-Remain politicians, and even from at least one European Commissioner  to pin the murder either to \"a supporter of Brexit\" (news sources from outside the UK, in various European countries and Russia have been putting this line over even more).  While the motives of the murderer are confused and obscure, there is nothing in the public domain that suggests this is realistically the case. (There are documents that suggest an interest and some kind of involvement in neo-nazism - but by long distance correspondence in the pre-internet era  with groups in the USA and South Africa. The report that the murderer shouted \"Britain First\"  - which itself is disputed - has been put in a new light by the revelation that a witness who made this claim has been shown to appear on the (leaked online, several years ago) membership list of a rival (and less extreme) far-right group, the British National Party, which has a history of seeking to discredit the Britain First group..... There is also evidence to suggest a long history of mental illness on the part of the murderer, while it remains unclear whether Mrs Cox was his intended target or not. (2)  The only, somewhat gory and past precedent that comes to mind concerns the murder, in September 2003, of the Swedish Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, who was a prominent campaigner in the referendum for Sweden to adopt the Euro. She was killed (in circumstances that also appeared very confused with motives not obvious) three days before the referendum. And despite the overwhelming \"establishment\" support for Euro adoption (as for Remain in the UK case), and the potential for a \"sympathy vote\", the referendum was still lost. Campaigning on the referendum has now ceased until Monday. (Small-scale elements - and I presume, but am not sure, the \"get the vote out\" door-knocking aspects - may take place over the weekend). On Monday Parliament has been recalled to pay tribute to Mrs Cox - which rules out campaigning on that day, while some other non-parliamentary organizations involved in the campaign (trade unions, for example) may be paying their respects to Mrs Cox on Tuesday. In effect this means that substantive campaigning on the ground may not take place until Wednesday - the day before the referendum. Still very difficult to interpret, in practice, what any or all of the above might mean for the outcome.

Perhaps the possibility of having to pay roaming charges if the UK leaves the EU will influence votes.  See below for details.   Polls for \"Remain\" continue to be largely negative by a margin that is less than the undecided vote, but polls lag reality.  Does \"Leave\" really still have momentum, or has \"Remain\" become re-energized by the recent negative polls? And what impact has the threats of suspension of England's football team because of  fan violencehad?  any?\n~~~~~~~\nhttp://europa.eu/rapid/midday-express.htm \"Today the Commission adopted a proposal to set maximum wholesale roaming charges (i.e. the prices that operators charge each other for the use of their networks) in order to make sure that the end of roaming charges for consumers, set for mid-June 2017, runs smoothly. The EU agreed that as of 15 June 2017 Europeans will pay the same price to use their mobile devices when travelling in the EU as they do at home (see press announcement and fact sheet). For this important change to happen, the Commission committed to reviewing the wholesale roaming markets, and is today delivering on the plans agreed with the European Parliament and the Council.  \"Vice-President for the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: \"In a year from now, we'll say goodbye to roaming charges. Our ambition is to abolish unjustified geo-blocking on the same occasion. We also want the cross-border portability of content to be a reality in 2017 so that Europeans can travel with their films, music, sports broadcasts, e-books across the EU. This will clearly be a triple win for European consumers\".  \"Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger added: \"We want to make sure that the end of roaming charges works properly for consumers and market players. This is why we come today with a proposal on wholesale roaming markets. We count now on the European Parliament and the Council to keep the pace and adopt it swiftly\".   \"As the summer holidays are getting closer, it is useful to remind that roaming charges have been cheaper than ever since 30 April: when travelling in the EU, mobile devices users only pay a small amount on top of their domestic prices: up to \u20ac0.05 per minute of call made, \u20ac0.02 per SMS sent, and \u20ac0.05 per MB of data (excl. VAT). These initiatives will be complemented by an ambitious update of EU telecoms rules in the autumn as part of the Commission's Digital Single Market strategy.

William Hague (a consummate Eurosceptic) has spoken out in favour of remain with the argument that Cameron has dealt with future sovereignty issues with the EU already due to the pressure the UK gov was able to put on the EU over the threat of leaving.

Looking at the forecasters here and the bookmakers, I suspect there could be risks of group think and circularity in the decision process.  Three important factors are raised consistently as a basis for this groups' forecasts to get to the average 70% probability, 1) the polls are not reliable, 2) the betting market is more reliable, and 3) the Scottish referendum.  Firstly I would make the assumption that polling methodologies have been improved since the Scottish and National election failures.  Secondly, the betting market is probably using the same factors we are using, polls are unreliable and Scottish referendum turned to No vote at the polling station, while late polls were signalling a surging Yes.  There is a lot of recency bias here.   But these are two different referendums with different hopes and fears.  I think it may be worthwhile weighing up the hopes over fears for Brexit.  Sovereignty and Immigration are the main hope and fear factors for the Leave campaign and economic deep recession is the fear factor for Remain.  The Remain campaign's biggest drawback is that neither Cameron nor Corbyn are true EU believers, so the campaign lacks that balance.  Unlike the Scottish referendum where Cameron government and the EU played hardball and stoked sufficient fear with Scottish and their small economy, the UK is a large economy and surely more confident in face of the risks and fears of the Remain campaign.  The UK also has a political and cultural history of \"Splendid Isolation\" from continental Europe and its affairs.  It helps being an island.  In conclusion I do think the polls may be more accurate this time and I do believe it will be a tighter contest than Scottish referendum.  The tendency of undecided people veering to the status quo at the polling station takes me to above 50% probability.

Independence referendums in developed democracies have only resulted in change in 20% of cases (albeit small sample of 5).  The balance of power amongst power players in the UK is on the side of Remain. This includes the political establishment and the City. They are able to maintain a high public profile for the arguments of the Remain campaign, partly by harnessing the support of public figures of gravitas (e.g. Major, Blair, Brown, Heseltine), but ultimately their capacity to influence is mediated through the mechanism by which the question is resolved: it is a vote. Polls offer some insight into how voters may vote. A polls of polls (FT) has shown a relatively tight contest since the beginning of the year. The results vary according to how the poll is conducted (telephone vs internet) and how polls are adjusted for the likelihood of each voter voting. Telephone polls are thought to favour Remain because the option to choose 'undecided' (or whatever) is less clear than in internet polls, which is postulated to lead to conservative choices by undecided voters in telephone polls. Despite a tight contest in the polls, there are approx. 10% undecideds, who may swing the vote one way or the other. I expect Remain to benefit more from the votes of these individuals. That is because all large-scale change including Brexit is a large risk, especially for a country which is experiencing decent economic growth, and that undecided voters will view it as such. This will increasingly be the case in the days leading up to the vote as the markets become volatile (as they are currently), and as the press and politicians try to draw as much attention to the referendum and its risks as possible. Polling analyses show that low turnout will favour Leave, and high turnout will favour Remain. I expect the press and establishment to garner sufficient attention for the issue for the turnout to be (relatively) high. There has been some suggestion of a high intention to vote from the fact that voting registration has been reopened due to demand. A further factor to consider is the impact of the 2m expats living in Europe and the 6-7m living worldwide. It seems unlikely that these voters would be in favour of Leave, if they do vote.\nAssuming that the 2m expats in Europe (4% of the electorate) vote (with UK rates of turnout), and are 60% in favour of Remain, this produces an extra 2.7% for Remain. Could I be wrong?\nTurnout may be less impressive than hoped (the weather might be terrible, there may be too much indifference amongst undecideds). Bad weather might be the most significant risk here.\nThe elderly, pro-Brexit vote may have a better turnout than expected.\nEvents - a terrorist attack? But there are only 10 days left, and it's unclear what this would do to votes - it may push people towards conservative voting, or it may convince them that unity with Europe is preventing us from policing our borders, or it might scare them into staying at home rather than going to the polls. Another event might be something at the Calais camp - another mass attempt to breach the tunnel? Overall, there's not much time left for these rare things to occur.

So, what else in new ? Biggest risks ? Traditional, STATUS QUO bias important in an extremely close & key referendum, does it hold up? Are \"expert\" pollsters under-estimating the recent Leave positive trend w/ less than two weeks remaining? More granular, are there similarities here in the UK referendum, to the pundits disparaging in the U.S., chances of outsiders D. Trump and B. Sanders to alter the political status quo, similar to the improving chance of the Leave campaign?\nFACTS: \nTOP DOWN, outside view: \nThe EU has an enormous problem. Geopolitically, it's status quo - middle of the road approach - is clearly under attack and, no longer acceptable for an increasing percentage of the population. NB: above mentioned PEW source. One can argue,  for those that live here, a \"wake up\" call.  However, is this fact enough, to push the Leave campaign, over the top, for what \"could\" be a LANDMARK decision by the voters? Standing alone, the answer is no. Geopolitically, however, facts never stand alone.  That is, in France, Le Pen's National Front has solidified its status. Austrians have made clear immigration is a key issue w/ the Freedom Party coming just short of electing its leader as President. Both make clear, the Brexit LEAVE phenomenon is not unusual. Incidentally in Austria , the status quo bias DID PLAY  a role w/ the Green Party leader winning by a razor thin margin. Additionally, the traditional German establishment now has  the AfD ( at times extremely questionable immigration positions) to work with within the Coalition governing body.

The Economist may or may not weigh polls, but they don't state their aggregation methodology, which reduces trust. Bloomberg's Likelihood score comes from ncpolitics, which has it at 24% Leave. The number of undecideds seems very small. The poll margin is 3.3%, with 9.2% undecided. So in order for that 3.3% to close, two-thirds or more of the undecideds have to switch. The math is fuzzy, but either way, the Leave campaign has to swing a lot of voters to make up the gap. There are a lot of polls on this issue, so accuracy is greater, and therefore the consensus is more informed by poll aggregation accuracy than usual.

This is not a vote down traditional party lines. The Conservative Party is hugely divided, while as much as a third of Labour Party voters could vote \"leave.\" Perhaps more importantly, in a referendum \u2014 as opposed to an election \u2014 the whole nation becomes a single geographic voting area, rather than 650 separate voting constituencies.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who votes \"stay,\" and his team need to make certain that enough people who support staying do in fact vote. He and George Osborne, who also votes \"stay,\" have tackled this by making all sorts of scary forecasts about what an Brexit would mean for the U.K. economy.

The tactic appeared to be working. However, in the last week, \"leave\" has fought back. The main catalyst is immigration.

The Remain side will argue that the economic risk associated with this policy is simply too great to take because, in their view, the Leave campaign has not come up with a trade policy consistent with its immigration policy that does not threaten the economy...\"\n2.

However, for me it looks like that the leave campaign is systematically overstated by the internet polling. It might be that the remain side overstates social liberal voters and academics (which tend to be Bremainer), but from what I can see the leave campaign is highly polarized while the remain side is clearly not passionate and more focused on economic benefits. Since the internet polls are self-selective the danger of overstating leave is a way higher than the risk over over-representation of academics / social-liberals in phone polling. Other indicators also tend to show a good chance of winning for remain (betting odds &  forecaster like number cruncher & status-quo-oriented voting behavior in  referendum votes). Apart from that: Northern Irish-voters (mainly remainer) and expats (probably mainly remainer) are systematically excluded from the polling.

Meanwhile, older people are dramatically more in favor of Brexit (by as much as 70/30 in some groups) and young people overwhelmingly back staying in the EU (by as much as 87 percent in some groups), so there is a big potential advantage to the Brexiters if there is a big age gap in voting. On the other hand, the less well-educated and affluent you are the more likely you are to support Brexit.

George Osborne, the chancellor, has already said the economy is likely to slow, while Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has suggested Britain might fall into a recession. The Treasury paper will add forecasts of a sharp fall in house prices and a rise in inflation, thanks largely to a drop in sterling. Brexiteers angrily dismiss all such talk as scaremongering. But even they have mostly conceded that the immediate effect of a Brexit vote would be negative, talking instead of a \u201cNike swoosh\u201d in which a short-term downturn is followed by a longer-term recovery.

There are two important factors to consider: First: Yes, the average poll sees the two sides neck-to-neck. But, I think it's important to be careful when considering which polls are reliable. One important trend is immediately visible: Online polls are around 50:50 when it comes to who will win the referendum. However, telephone polls consistently show that the \"remain\" side is more popular. For a variety of reasons, I consider telephone polls far more reliable than online ones. Most of these reasons boil down to *who* fills out these polls. A telephone poll can be taken from anyone who has a phone and is willing to answer the question asked by Gallup, YouGov or whoever is asking. That means that we have a more statistically robust cross-section of the population, since almost everyone owns some kind of phone (old and young, male and female, left or right, libertarian or authoritarian). Online polls are different. They are filled out by the people likely to A: Go online and B: Fill out an online poll. This matters, because online polls usually favor the portion of the population that is most motivated to go out and announce their opinions. But the loudest in the room do not have to be the most numerous. Most of the time, people who are for a change of the status quo are the most motivated and the loudest, but are often (though not always) in the minority. So it is here two. From the polls, I believe we can conclude two findings: A - The average British citizen, when asked, will choose to remain with the EU. B - The people who want to leave are more motivated, but less numerous. Elsewhere in life, sheer determination can count for much, yes. It may be argued that the determination of the \"leave\" side is what made this referendum possible in the first place. But in a referendum this close, motivation and ambition count for little. Numbers are all that matter. So, I am assigning 2/3 that this referendum will go in favor of \"remain\". Personally, I think the \"leave\" side is doomed, but we must leave for several factors, including unexpected events and the possibility that the people from the \"leave\" camp may be more motivated to go out and vote.

(Exit polls on election night weren\u2019t very good either.) At least the polls got the 2012 U.S. presidential election right? Well, sort of.

Excluding respondents who said they didn\u2019t know how they were going to vote, or were unsure, Remain holds a near 10 per cent average lead.55 online polls conducted this year it is Brexit that holds the average lead. In fact, seven of the past 10 reported online polls returned a vote that would see the UK leave the EU. \"YouGov claims that phone pollsters were surveying too many graduates in their EU referendum polls \u2014 a social group which is generally more likely to vote against a Brexit.The article says that survey group Populus was using samples where up to 46% of the respondents had degrees, despite the fact that only around 27-33% of the British population has degrees.

There are two key forces to weigh up, where turnout is concerned: 'Leave' voters have a much higher average age, and we know older voters are much more likely to turn out to vote. But 'Remain' voters have a much higher average education level ('Remain' has a 30% lead among university graduates), and more educated voters are *also* more likely to turn out. According to Anthony Wells of YouGov, these two forces roughly cancel out. So with finely balanced public opinion, and little to guide us in terms of turnout, why am I 75% certain that 'remain' will win? My answer in three words: \"status quo bias.\" We saw in the Scottish Independence referendum that undecided voters broke for 'Remain' at a disproportionate rate. So if the 12% of voters currently self-reporting as 'undecided' prove equally likely to prefer the status quo, that should be enough to tip the balance in favour of remain.

What to make of this? One possibility is that both of these polls are outliers. An unweighted average of polls this month has both \"stay\" and \"leave\" at 43%, with \"undecided\" at 14.3%. That's close to the April numbers: \"stay\" = 44.43%, \"leave\" = \"41.71,\" \"undecided\" = 12.38%[2]. The Guardian phone poll has \"stay\" at 47 and \"leave\" at 39 (which is an eight-point spread, not a ten-point spread as the quote above says, I must have missed something), and that's about 1.5 standard deviations from the mean for \"stay\" and about the same for \"leave.\" The Internet poll was less out of line with the numbers we see elsewhere, with only \"leave\" more than a standard deviation away from the mean. I don't know enough about the merits of phone vs. Internet polling to have an informed opinion, but my best guess is that we don't yet have enough experience with Internet polling to speak to its accuracy in any reliable way[3]. Maybe I'm too pessimistic; who knows? So that was something of a dead end, I think. But another way to try to get traction on the Brexit question is to look at party membership. The same Guardian piece gives us the following breakdown of UK party membership: UKIP: 13%\nTorries: 36%\nLibDems: 7%\nLabourites: 34%\nScotNats (SNP): 5%\nGreens: 4%\nOther: 1% Let's assume - why not? - that voters turn out for the referendum in numbers proportional to their party membership. (Will they? Probably not. But it's not a terrible working assumption.) I'm willing to bet that UKIP is all in for breaking with Brussels, so that 13% for \"leave.\" What about the ScotNats? This is a trickier question than I imagined. It might seem like a no-brainer for members of the SNP to vote for an exit to the EU and then follow that up with a second referendum on Scottish membership in the UK[4]. But SNP leadership is painfully aware that (i) losing a second referendum so soon after losing the first would probably cripple the independence movement for a generation (see Quebec) and (ii) the ScotNats might not yet be in a position to win[5]. In fact, some who favor Scottish independence would like to see it be part of the EU! (That's not as odd as it might sound. Scotland has a long and troubled history with England, but that doesn't mean the Scots wouldn't want voluntary shared governance with other European powers.) So there's no clear reason (that I can see) to think that ScotNats will vote overwhelmingly for Brexit. Indeed, one recent poll suggested that the Scots (who are not the same as members of the SNP, of course) favor remaining in the EU 3-to-1[6]. That gets us up to 15.5%. The Tories seem deeply divided over Brexit - another anglophone conservative party in jeopardy because of a populist uprising[7]? Take these numbers for whatever they're worth, but according to one recent poll, \"45 per cent of voters said [pro-Brexit Troy Boris] Johnson was \"more likely to tell the truth about the EU than [anti-Brexit Tory David] Cameron, while 21 per cent said the opposite\"[8]. Boris has, as we know, said some extraordinary things of late: \"Napoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods.\" For reals, ya'll. That's the voice of truth, according to 2 out of 3 Tories. Well, suppose they do break for Brexit in slightly lower numbers - say 3-out-of-5 Tories vote \"leave.\" That gets \"leave\" up to 37.1%. The Greens look like a pretty solid bet to vote \"stay,\" since EU environmental protection and regulation is bound to be much better than anything you're likely to get in the UK alone[9]. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for bankers and their City cronies, who are no friends of the Party of Kermit [10]. Suppose then that the Greens go overwhelming for \"stay\" but a few vote \"leave.\" That gets \"leave\" up to 37.75%. It's hard for me to suss out exactly what the LibDems are up to. Some of their leadership has made noises up the increased strain on the NHS if the UK leaves the EU[11]. LibDemster Tim Farron has called pro-Brexit thought leaders \"downright pathetic\"[12]. Suppose the LibDems go for \"stay\" in roughly the same numbers as the Tories go for \"leave.\" That gets \"leave\" up to 40%. What about the Laborites? \"Nearly two thirds of Labour voters say they are likely to vote to Remain \u2013 around six million people,\" according to one source[13]. That sounds pretty good until you realize it also means that one third of Labour voters say that they are likely to vote to leave. Even if Jeremy Corbyn is able to step up - no sure thing as he's rather ambivalent about Brexit [14] - that still means you've got 51% voting \"leave.\" So...wow...goodbye to all that. Or not. All that was very back-of-the-envelope. But it's not crazy. I might have (okay, I'm sure I do have) some of the numbers wrong. It's been almost a decade since I lived in England, so I don't exactly have my finger on the pulse of the UK. Still, this seems like a model I can work with, even if I have to modify the numbers a bit.

I am proceeding on the assumption that the intent of the Q is some version of \"Will Stay prevail?\" and not what the words actually say, but I am increasingly frustrated by the inability of these characters to say what they mean--unless they mean to care about the majority as such, in which case they simply have no idea at all of why people participate in this stuff, or even what is important in the actual world.

I want Britain to be the biggest and best it can be. I want to have all the influence.  I want us to be part of a gang that makes us stronger, makes our voice louder.  I want us to eat our dinner at the grown up table. I want to be at the party where the decisions are made, not the person crying in the kitchen because the popular gang didn\u2019t let us play.\" Comparing Britain to a kid trying to make friends isn't really analogous in my opinion, and I'm not sure that particular appeal to emotion is terribly powerful compared to the well of traditional patriotism that \"Leave\" proponents can dip into. And there's this at the end:  \"Never in all my working or personal life has going something alone, without friends been a choice I would make. I believe in the power of a group to achieve things, even when some of that group does my head in. Doing things alone is always slower, less productive, and more doomed to fail.\" To which the emotional appeal of a \"Leave\" proponent would be: \"Did we care about being alone after Dunkirk?\" That answer may not have much to do with modern reality, but the author's subjective observations about going it alone don't have much behind them either. I think this particular attempt to appeal to British patriotism is a failure, and pro-EU Britons should stick to practical economic arguments. I'm not sure such arguments would prevail, but the pro-EU side attempting to play the game on terms dictated by the anti-EU side is a losing proposition.

Telephone polling shows a persistent clear bias to remain, although online polling has more fluctuation. General online polling seems to have resulted in a clear pickup in leave with a worrying decrease in \"I Don't Know\" (IDK). If you focus on YouGov polling, however, Remain seems to have the upper hand. I prefer the YouGov online polling because I believe that they have a more sound approach to developing their surveys than other polling firms. Some polling firms, in fact, seem to exhibit clear biases, like ICM. So every poll that gets reported does require significant inspection.  I am beginning to believe that the real consequences of Brexit are lower than many people have suggested. While there is certainly going to be short term uncertainty and adjustment, a great deal of the modeling has difficulty taking into account the potential changes in the economy that will result as some of the UKs trading relationships with the UK shift. The accepted wisdom seems to be a 1% reduction in GDP for some period of time, but I have a hard time believing that this will be a permanent shock. Thus, some of the economic arguments against Brexit may not be effective.  To the last point I am most concerned that the \"Bremain\" camp still lacks an argument that stirs fire in the bellies of the populace. The sovereignty argument proffered by Brexit supporters is inspiring, if fallacious, in a way that the economic argument is not. I believe it to be fallacious for 2 reasons: 1) the UK has not ceded complete governing authority to the EU and 2) in a globalized system countries yield sovereignty to supranational organizations in order to participate in the global system. These, however, are nuanced points beyond what can be fit into a sound bite. The sound bites, from esteemed former parliamentarians like Nigel Lawson, are much more stirring. Although Lord Lawson's arguments are non-existent, the difficulty of explaining the absurdity of the sovereignty argument allows it to remain compelling.  I am revising my forecast upwards because the ramifications from the Paris attacks were not as long lasting or as large as I thought they would be.

You can also date to the 18th century the ideas of a liberal political order, with natural rights that the state is obliged to respect, and the right of people to choose their system of government. These ideas are intimately related. The \"nation\" is a community of people bound together by language, custom, and common founding myths or \"national epics.\" Once communities of people began to see themselves in these terms, the state took on a new identity: the state derived its legitimacy and authority because it acted as the agent of the nation. Prior to this, monarchs had been sovereign; now \"the people\" were sovereign. Authority didn't derive from God or tradition; even monarchs ruled by permission of their peoples (as Charles I and Louis XVI found out). From the beginning, nationalism could be used as an excuse for horrific oppression in the name of \"the people.\" Exclusion from the political community that was identified as \"the people\" often resulted in persecution of those excluded. No denying that, and I wouldn't attempt to; but nationalism is also associated with the rise of individual rights, if only within the sharply circumscribed definitions of the \"nation.\" This is because if the \"people\" were the sole source of political legitimacy, there had to be a mechanism by which they could make their will known, and so we had free speech, elections (restricted to members of the nation, and not even all of them), etc. Prior to the rise of nationalism, governments (at least in the west) were considered agents of God, or a dynasty, or a religion, or some abstraction. With nationalism, governments were regarded as the agents of a specific community of human beings (albeit by definition exclusive ones). Moreover, in the two to three hundred years since nationalism became the most widely recognized organizing principle of government, every other organizing principle has been considered suspect or deficient. Nations might adopt a liberal human rights regime, and consider all persons to have \"inalienable\" rights. But even so, a national government was only obliged to act on behalf of its own people. In fact, acting on behalf of another people was a breach of a national government's fiduciary duty. It might align and cooperate with other national  governments, and it was bound by its agreements to them, but other nations and governments had no moral claim to demand favors, protection, or resources from any other nation's government. A national government was responsible only to its own people.  I think opposition to the EU in Great Britain and elsewhere derives from the perception that the EU is not acting as the agent of Europeans as a people. For example, the EU commitment to human rights is a commitment to the abstraction of human rights, universally applied. The trend in European countries for the past two centuries has been to reject the idea that governments have a responsibility to take care of people outside of their sharply defined political community. This may be good or bad, but in my opinion this is the issue. That's why I'm not sure that economic arguments will be conclusive in this referendum. We may find that this referendum is about competing theories of government."], [24005, "2016-04-29T19:09:29Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2016-04-29T17:37:46Z", [1.0], ""], [23117, "2016-04-29T12:41:21Z", [0.72], "Polls look very close and contradictory.  \nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3563002/Obama-fails-swing-Britain-EU-Out-takes-lead--YouGov-poll-indicates.html"], [691, "2016-04-29T12:12:24Z", [0.82], ""], [241, "2016-04-29T11:29:05Z", [0.6], ""], [22680, "2016-04-29T10:52:18Z", [0.67], ""], [1766, "2016-04-29T10:01:35Z", [0.75], ""], [12591, "2016-04-29T07:33:32Z", [0.75], ""], [23483, "2016-04-29T05:31:17Z", [0.73], ""], [24176, "2016-04-29T01:10:45Z", [1.0], "Yes, Yes, Yes.\nSince immigration and currency values of mainland Europe doesn't effect UK directly."], [21046, "2016-04-28T21:35:56Z", [0.77], ""], [20135, "2016-04-28T18:03:43Z", [0.45], "I am watching the GBP v.

After a bit of reflection on my last forecast, I think further revision is in order. The central thesis of my last forecast was that, if we squint really hard, we can probably see the beginning of the Renwick effect[a]. I now think that I was mistaken. We might or might not see the Renwick effect in the future, but we're not seeing it yet. Or at least _I'm_ not seeing it yet, which is a somewhat different proposition.  Why the change of mind?

In fact, we see a very slight movement _away_ from the status quo, though I think that the size of the shift is too small to mean much. What's most remarkable to me is the stability of the opinion polling data over the last 3 months. (It would be super-freaking-awesome if someone tried to determine whether this level of stability prior to the referendum predicts a greater or lesser degree of variability in the final weeks before the referendum, but the low sample size might render this information less than fully helpful.)

Color me *a little* skeptical though. The average of the 12 (12!) polls taken in April (as reported by \"The Financial Times\"[2]) shows less than a 2% gap between thems that wants to stay and thems that don't: 42.75% = \"stay\" and 40.83% = \"go.\" Of course that leaves 14.59% who haven't made up their minds. If you assume that the undecided won't break in large numbers for either of \"stay\" or \"go\" (and I don't know of any evidence that counts strongly against this assumption), then \"stay\" gets 51.1% of the vote, and \"go\" gets 48.8%, with a standard deviation of a little more than 4%. That gives us about a 61% chance of \"stay\" winning, and that seems too close for comfort.  But maybe the numbers shouldn't be taken at face value. So I tried weighting the polls for temporal proximity. I gave those polls done within a week a weight of 1.0, those within 2 weeks a weight of 0.75, those within 2 weeks a weight of 0.50, and those done at the beginning of the month a weight of 0.25. The average outcomes  barely changed: \"Stay\" = 51.5%, \"leave\" = 48.5%, but the lower standard deviation (2.6%) predicts a much higher probability of a victory for \"stay\": 72%. And I also tried giving more weight to the polls that have larger groups of respondents, roughly giving a poll that has 3 times as many respondents 3 times as much weight. Yes, I know that's a pretty naive approach, but what ya want for free? The results were \"stay = 51%, \"go\" = 49%, with a standard deviation of 2.2%, and a 67% chance of victory for \"stay.\" Things look better for \"stay\" than they did a month ago, but not as much as the GJ consensus forecast would suggest. Of course, it might be that the consensus forecast is higher because people expect to see the Renwick effect[3]. I do too, at least to some extent.

I've said in the past that I am skeptical that macroeconomic arguments will necessarily sway the voters, as opposed to the experts. I give two quotes from the report below, with my comments. Both refer to immigration to the UK. p. 90: \u201cThe best evidence we have, then, suggests that to the extent EU free movement raises unemployment among the UK-born at all, the effect is small; it goes away after a few years as the labour market adjusts; and is strongest in recessions.\u201d Comment: The impact may be small in macroeconomic terms, but people don't live their lives in macroeconomic terms. You can't say to your creditors that you'll pay your bills \"after a few years as the labour market adjusts.\" p. 100: \"However, recent studies have found that immigration has caused local house prices to fall. There are two reasons for this. First, migrants \ntend to live in more cramped conditions than do Britons. Second, the researchers found that when immigrants move into a local area, Britons move away, and so demand for housing falls in the short term. However, Britons will push up prices in the areas they move to, and in the long run, migrants are likely to move into less crowded accommodation. This will push up housing costs \u2013 unless Britain builds more houses \u2013 especially in the south-east of England.\" Comment: What this means in practical terms is that migrants are crowded into ghettos that Britons don't want to live in or near. You can say this is bigoted, but that doesn't affect the reality of it, and ordinary people will consider this reality when they vote. This is more than an economic issue; it's a matter of people's perception of social cohesion. Advocates of the EU make the argument that the Union helps to suppress nationalist impulses. If the above is correct, that isn't true; it merely localizes those nationalist impulses, and instead of disliking or resenting foreigners in adjacent countries, you dislike and resent foreigners in adjacent neighborhoods. I am not saying that Brexit is a good idea, or even that it will pass. All I am saying is that what we read in the newspapers, or in think tank reports is written by people who belong to an educated, financially secure, international class that is insulated from the policies that it advocates, implements and maintains. If enough average Britons already think the existing arrangements don't give them any advantage - and perhaps put them at a real disadvantage - the arguments made by this international class will not convince them.

By PETER HENN\nPUBLISHED: 00:00, Wed, Apr 13, 2016  A new survey published today shows the Leave camp have surged ahead of the Europhiles despite David Cameron wasting \u00a39 million of taxpayers' money on a biased pro-Brussels propaganda pamphlet.  Crucially, the polling shows that as the number of people backing Brexit has increased the level of undecided voters has dropped off correspondingly, indicating people are starting to make their minds up in favour of severing ties with Brussels.  The survey, produced by respected pollsters ICM, shows that 45% of people now want to leave the EU compared to just 42% who want to remain.  That result represents a surge in support for Brexit in recent weeks. ICM's last poll indicated that 43% wanted to stick with Brussels and 42% to leave the EU club.

Basis for HIGH OUTSIDE\nhttps://twitter.com/lilolvvorn/status/718130093768503298 Was frustrated with seeing a lot of forecasts that list recent polls as their probability; wasn't sure why, this drawing was my attempt to address that initial discomfort. Thought illustration conveyed the point better than text, so uploaded this image to Twitter.  Brexit Vote Will Come Down to Approx 10% Swing Voters Generally speaking, here is how I split my 10 point probability cookie (see illustration) into approximate 1/3rds lol, sorry, it\u2019s less science and more like the art of repeatedly splitting a fig newton\u2014to come up with the 98%-99%. The 10% figure refers to only those voters who can be swung either way by argument, ignorance, active intention\u2014whatever means.  --Expect 1/3 chunk to be politically active people swayed by arguments for either side; both sides have some good arguments--can't predict much here.  (Minus .5-1.5) --Expect 1/3 chunk to be young & or new voters; following from that, new voter registration would be a good key area of focus for either group. I feel this leans in the NAYs favor.  (Minus .5-1) --Expect 1/3 portion of potentially dissatisfied / angry /disenfranchised somehow, which would be a boon for the YAYs, however the majority of any marginalized group is unlikely to participate in the system of power it feels marginalized by, wouldn't expect many voters here. They would also be potentially hard to find, and likely highly suspicious if approached by a campaigner in a non-organic way. This is the context in which I view Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to make his first big Brexit speech to hauling warehouse workers and then proceed to jump behind the wheel of his campaigns lorry. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson/12190736/EU-referendum-Boris-Johnson-fires-up-the-Brexit-juggernaut.html  Could political stunts like this snowball momentum for Brexit? Will obviously keep watching closely.   After 10% OUTSIDE Slice--Psychology as Key Metric --The UK is center stage for the leadership\u2019s sex-decadial (lol 60 years or hexaconta years) courtship ritual with the EU\u2014all foreplay no action. Thus I think a psychological metric of FEAR of the unknown, lack of autonomous thinking that we are all susceptible to in times of perceived crisis, on top of Mt. Everest and Mauna Kea loyalties based on the drawing above, can serve as a framework through which to build this forecast. This is also why I bring in references from actors like Jeremy Irons who mocks the disingenuous show of the back and forth between Cameron and Boris and others; one might assume his skills as a pretender makes it easier to spot another\u2014an ironic litmus test.  I honestly don\u2019t think anything that the Brexit campaigners say about UK being out of the UK is intrinsically wrong, the UK might very well do better, but only if the entire nation is motivated to step up and grab the bull by the horns to develop new trade deals; but most people are not bull horn grabbers, and the meek shall not inherit the earth.  ---The fact that this entire shit-storm is framed as a standoff between Cameron and Johnson makes the content of all their arguments seem like disingenuous rubbish\u2014and any voter who picks up on this is likely to be resentful and I think this works in the NAYs favor, but might have the effect of reducing overall voter turnout. (Will do some more thinking on potential voter turnout issue). (Not Blind To) Recent Developments--Think 10% Framework Still Applies  --Sterling still going down, sthg like 7% YOY by now http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/22/pound-falls-city-gets-brexit-jitters-business-live. The lower it goes, I suggest the higher the certainty of no Brexit. I mentioned this at the start of my first forecast, so the continued downward trajectory is the rationale for my bump today.  --Aye, saw WSJ article on Dutch vote; I need to read more on exactly what this will mean, but another forecaster [@Rimbaud] has shared an analysis with me that this is unlikely to change things much.  --Eye saw Cameron admit he's got Panama money--wasn't much and he claims to have paid his taxes, might have been a big deal if he was a better investor. Boris probably used a more discreet (and tech-savvy) firm in Panama lol.  Cameron\u2019s spin people could try to highlight how UK investors are not now limited from investing worldwide\u2014as a silver lining.  --I think the Brussels terrorist attack will only serve to bring the EU closer together in the long-run: by heightening fear locally, and by increasing pressure from external nations for the EU to act as a unified whole\u2014and likely, based on Brussels being caught off-guard and overextended\u2014will mean some necessary reforms and additional budgeting.

That says it can only tap into what energy is most readily available as an engine for change--that said, the currents that allow them to tap in and give them a boost are counterproductive in the long-run to the movement--it's like swimming against the current to stand still. 4/15/16 AHA, the vindication of reality meeting with expectation; Brexit campaign has officially selected Vote Leave More to the point, \"Vote Leave has been trying to make a liberal case for Brexit, with a focus on less regulation and freer trade.\" Should their campaigning efforts be very effective I will certainly not taste the vindication of my current forecast meeting with reality; I think Brexit is making a good move here in terms ideological focus.

It has already been signed by Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte\u2019s government, and approved by all other EU nations, but the 61% to 38% majority for a no-vote on Thursday 7 April was an overwhelming result. It has been suggested that the result gives anti-EU campaigns both there and in Britain a boost.

WILL DAVID CAMERON'S CRISES BOOST BREXIT?\nBY JOSH LOWE ON 4/8/16 AT 11:26 AM\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/david-cameron-brexit-tata-steel-panama-papers-ids-resignation-445522 A string of crises have hit U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s government in recent weeks, potentially damaging the campaign to keep Britain in the European Union ahead of a June 23 membership referendum. This week, it was continued questioning over Cameron and his father\u2019s finances that had the usually-unruffled politician on the front pages for all the wrong reasons. Before that, it was the malaise settling over Britain\u2019s once-proud steel industry , when Indian Tata steel said it would be withdrawing from its British businesses, risking thousands of jobs. All this came after the resignation of former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who in an extraordinary interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show said the government was in danger of \u201cdrifting in a direction that divides society rather than unites it.\u201d ... Campaigners on both sides might be expected to play up the impact of individual events. Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at the University of Kent, says that criticism of Cameron over his finances in particular may not have much impact, as \u201cthe suggestion that David Cameron is part of a wealthy elite is already priced into British politics.\u201d But, he says, \u201cwe know that dissatisfaction with the government is on the rise\u2026 that is significant as a backdrop to the referendum, especially if we remember that referendums are often influenced by general opinion toward the incumbent government of the day.\u201d While, therefore, Cameron\u2019s crises may not wildly swing the vote towards Leave, they are, says Goodwin, \u201cnot particularly helpful\u201d for the Remain camp. So whether Cameron drives significant numbers of votes away from Remain or not, what\u2019s certain is that he has been much less of a boon than some expected to the Remain campaign...."], [23691, "2016-04-08T19:59:19Z", [0.63], ""], [368, "2016-04-08T19:37:47Z", [0.65], ""], [3225, "2016-04-08T18:56:16Z", [0.6], ""], [241, "2016-04-08T18:41:57Z", [0.45], ""], [4273, "2016-04-08T18:38:28Z", [0.62], ""], [23687, "2016-04-08T18:31:16Z", [0.65], ""], [14182, "2016-04-08T17:55:42Z", [0.68], "Remain fixed w/ a tendency towards a higher number as time passes depending upon change in facts &/or circumstances.

Hope it works for you. Taking the telephone & online issue on its own, one is left w/ an important question : Is the truth somewhere BETWEEN online and phone polls but, closer to 2/3rds of phone polls are saying? 3. Next, TURNOUT another key. Lynton Crosby, takes a top down ( independent/outside view??) which makes clear, it now remains for the Remain campaign to mobilize their vote. The more uncertain the outcome is ( as it is now and, for the foreseeable future), the more important every vote seems, therefore voters belief in their ability to influence outcome of the referendum.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/04/it-now-remains-for-the-in-campaign-to-mobilise-their-vote/  a) NB: Drilling down into the problem a little deeper : If one considers, instead, high & low -turnout demographics, \"older people\"  are more likely to vote leave but, more affluent and, younger people in reasonable incoming earning ages are more likely to to vote remain. Is this a reasonable proposition, in the first instance? \nhttp://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2016/03/30/trying-to-work-out-who-will-turn-out-in-the-referendum-of-june-23rd/;  http://www2.politicalbetting.com/index.php/archives/2016/03/28/the-eu-referendum-a-battle-between-the-social-classes/\nb) More specifically,  the largest definable risk to the Remain campaign is the complacency factor according to Sir Lynton Crosby http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12194138/Remain-or-leave-It-all-rests-on-the-risk-factor.html\nc) Finally,  PM Cameron has invested \"what is left\" of his political capital w/ voters to push for an IN vote. He is looking like an increasingly like a \"dead duck\" UK PM rather than the Obama \"lame duck\" Presidency. One must consider the ancillary effects of the recent Panama documents disclosures ALONG WITH http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/08/panama-papers--david-cameron-admits-he-profited-from-fathers-off/?WT.mc_id=e_DM107887&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_FPM_New_AEM_Recipient&utm_source=email&utm_medium=Edi_FPM_New_AEM_Recipient_2016_04_08&utm_campaign=DM107887   the fact that he will now be forced to debate a decision he made to spend substantial funds (approx. 10mn\u00a3) on pro EU propaganda https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/659106/EU-referendum-petition-protest-David-Cameron-Government-pro-EU-leaflets-9m : \nOn the other hand - is there \nTROJEN HORSE effect ?? Pure speculation on my part. Am simply trying to balance/distinguish  the focused/detailed 1-3 (a-c) issues with more difficult to define side outside or top down recent affects of having Cameron pushing so hard for the IN vote when he is bleeding politically. Is this detrimental to the IN campaign effort ? Adding it all up in a sum of the parts decision: there simply isn't, at this stage, enough evidence/facts on the ground to convincingly make the base case LEAVE sufficiently convincing to alter my forecast.

From my research I feel the \"leave\" camp holds a slight by firm advantage leading into June 23rd.

The conclusion of the argument is that in major referenda like the one coming up on whether or not Britain will remain in the EU, support for the \"yes\" position tends to decrease quickly in the months and weeks leading up to the referendum itself. This bar chart (from Renwick's piece) does a pretty good job of laying out the evidence[c]: (https://pythagorassite.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/renwick___don_t_trust_your_poll_lead___in_cowley_and_ford__2014__pdf.png?w=978) I feed the numbers into a spreadsheet (though I had to do a little guesstimating because of the lack of granularity along the vertical axis), and it looks like the support for the yes/change side of the referenda drops in the month or so before the event on average by 11.6% but with high variability: 14.7%. The whole thing looks something like this: (https://pythagorassite.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screenshot_4_1_16__6_37_pm.png?w=920) Let's take this at face value and see what we find. We could start with the Financial Times, which has some nice meta-polling data, represented in the first graph above[d]. An unweighted average of the polls taken so far in March results in 0.46 for staying in the EU, 0.42 for leaving it, and 0.12 undecided. Let's leave the undecided folks out of the picture, just as Renwick does. (I assume that the bias toward to status quo is largely a result of undecided types coming in at the last moment with a vote for keeping things as they are. I can't recall whether Renwick's paper addresses this matter, and I'm too busy/lazy to look through it again.) That means that we're looking at a probability of about 0.52 (=0.46/(0.46+0.42)) of staying and a probability of about 0.48 (=0.42/(0.46+0.42)) of leaving the EU. It looks like what we're supposed to expect on average a -11.62% drop in support for the a \"yes\" result in the referendum (i.e., a result that leads to a change in the status quo). In this case, that's a drop in support for the Brexiting to 0.425 (0.48-(0.48*0.1162)) and, conversely, an opposition to Brexiting of 0.575 (1-(0.48-(0.48*0.1162))). This would be an overwhelming win for the forces of sanity over the eurosceptics, in my humble opinion. Given the standard deviation is 0.06 (=14.69 % of 0.425), the range of expectation looks something like this: (https://pythagorassite.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/normal_distribution_calculator_with_step_by_step_explanation.png?w=978) So if this model is correct, then we should expect a mere 10% (or so) chance of a vote to leave the EU. But is the model correct? Several reasons for doubt concerns the data points themselves, though there are ways to try to account for these concerns. First, many of the referenda took place in nations with very small (by global standards) populations, and small populations make polling very difficult. Sweden had only 8 million citizens in 1980. Ireland had only 5 million citizens in 1986. I expect that polls for a country of 65 million citizens in 2016 are likely to be a bit more predictive, all other things being equal. I suppose that the best way to try to take this into consideration would be to discount polls taken in smaller countries. As I have no principled way to do this, I won't try. But I'd be pleased as punch if someone else did.  Second, several countries had many referenda. Bloody Ireland! How many referenda do you need, mates? Yes, democracy and all that, I suppose. But still.... Anyway, we can easily control for that by removing multiple referenda in a single country and replacing them with a single average for referenda in that country. The results look like this: (https://pythagorassite.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screenshot_4_1_16__9_47_pm.png?w=920) As is obvious, the results are less dramatic, though only slightly so. We should expect 5.2% less support for Brexit at the polls on June 23, down to 42.8%, with a standard deviation of 6.3%. That leaves about a 13% chance of the pro-Brexit forces getting for than 50% of the vote. Using Olympic rules (tossing out the highest and lowest scores) tames the data even further. We should expect 4.9% less support for Brexit at the polls on June 23, down to 43.1%, with a standard deviation of 5.4%. But it still means less than an 11% chance of Brexit. I assume that Renwick is himself is making some data-shaping modifications similar to the one's I'm playing with here, since he himself is (as of the date of this writing) giving Brexit a 13% chance, as you can see from his blog. (https://pythagorassite.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/first_forecast_for_the_brexit_referendum___elections_etc.png?w=978) Another reason for doubt concerns the similarity between the kind of referenda used to build the model and the referendum to be voted upon in late June. In some cases, the referenda are very similar to what's going on in the UK right now, viz., the Danish referendum of 1992[e]. But the 1980 Swedish referendum on nuclear power and the 1997 Welsh referendum on creating an assembly with devolved powers[g] are less so. The way to handle this, I think, would be to create a similarity scale which would allow us to discount the importance of referenda that are less like the Brexit referendum on the horizon. But I work (more or less) for a living (again, more or less) and don't have the time on my hands right now. Finally (not really finally, but this is the last thing that came to mind while typing this up), there's the matter of local issues that might matter. I don't know, e.g., much about Swedish elections (and that's an understatement), but perhaps there are typical patterns of voting that are true in Sweden but are not true in the UK that have relevance here. Maybe Swedish voters regularly are especially risk averse at election time but not so prior to the election, while UK voters aren't. Who the hell knows? But if I were going to put all my eggs in this particular basket, I'd want to find out.  All that said, I feel fairly confident that this tendency to shift toward the status quo is real, and it's made me a lot more confident that Britain will vote to remain in the EU. So I'm moving from 61% to 71% likelihood of the UK voting against Brexit.  -- Endnotes [a] and [b] removed.

There's lots of reasons to discount these polls at face value, since lots of them have \"undecided\" voters, and in referendums voters tend to make up their mind more at the last minute (there is no easy party affiliation box to check like in general elections).

When push comes to shove lots of voters will opt for status quo, since a radical break from the UK increases uncertainty in trade, security, immigration, other issues, and is therefore relatively risky to remaining.\n2) While the deal that Cameron is shopping was initially viewed as negative, he was nonetheless able to whip votes back to his camp against what was considered at the time to be fairly stiff headwinds with the Scottish referendum, so there is some recent precedence in his ability to do so. This is also somewhat in line with my prior rational that UK's elites have historically (going back to 19th century w/ PMs Disraeli & Gladstone) been able to persuade public opinion with big national security interests, and a unified Europe is a more secure one vis-a-vis extra-European security threats (at least from nation states).\n3) This interesting polling analysis indicated that, despite peoples' opinion on the referendum, there is more wiggle room to the \"remain\" side than \"leave\": https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/12/10/eu-polling-soft-leave/\n4) This other interesting polling analysis indicated that, despite peoples' opinion on the referendum, UK citizens are generally more bearish on UK's prospects leaving the EU, which somewhat confirms 3).

As a result, 52% is my initial estimate. I wouldn't aggregate a higher percentage due to older data, but the trend (\"yes\" winning) seems consistent. Having in mind that the average Telegraph reader is 18% more likely to vote NO, I will raise the 52% to 55%. Taking also in mind this report (http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/l2qxf3d9pp/YG-Trackers-Europe-Referendum-070316.pdf), I hold the 55% with marginally higher confidence. Now, I think that the polls are underestimating yes for three reasons. (Assumption 1.1) First, polls are (I think) conducted in Britain (obvious, but important). This means that British people working in other countries do not participate in said polls. (Assumption 1.2:) I find it reasonable that the latter would vote YES. The second reason has to do again with the polls. I think they are (Assumption 2.1) being conducted in hours that lead to an underrepresentiation of certain categories of the working force (i.e. investment companies, etc). I find that (Assumption 2.2) the majority of these categories would be pro EU. Finally, I believe (Assumption 3.1) that the undecided will lean toward the result that promises less change. Time to put weights. For the second reason, I estimate that the effect (if real) will be minimal. So let's go to 57%. The first is easier to estimate. The total turnout in the 2015 elections was at a high 30.7 million. Now, there are 1.3 million Britons living/working in the EU. (Assumption 4.1) I doubt any more than 10% would go to vote, I even doubt 5% will. As a result I renew my figure slighly up to 59%. Along with the third reason (\"undecided\"), I will raise it to 62%. Before closing, I would like to factor in an outside influence: the EU. As the time closes in, I believe the latter (Assumption 5.1) will lean towards British positions even more than they already have (federalists are already crying inside). I'll give a 5% to this, and get the final estimate to 67%. The reason I'm afraid to give any higher percentage is that I don't know how much the rhetoric for either position will appeal towards its respective base. I (would-be assumption 6.1) believe the NO rhetoric to be stronger. Also, I think rationality will not play a vital role in this referendum (after all, measuring the effect of Brexit would be extremely hard)."], [19601, "2016-03-27T20:56:48Z", [0.45], ""], [17856, "2016-03-27T20:51:03Z", [0.62], ""], [22515, "2016-03-27T20:20:58Z", [0.85], ""], [368, "2016-03-27T20:00:59Z", [0.85], ""], [14182, "2016-03-27T19:09:14Z", [0.75], ""], [22147, "2016-03-27T17:51:03Z", [0.49], "I'm dropping my prediction from 50% to 49% because of a few incidents:   * Iain Duncan Smith's departure\n  * Terrorist attack in Brussels -- For many, Brussels is inexorably linked to the EU\n  * Pro-Leave letter released, signed by >200 SME business leaders[1].

Terrorism may increase voter turnout levels[f], and there's some evidence that it causes voters to skew right a bit[g].

However, that attack took place a mere three days before voters went to the polls. But I doubt that Brussels is a game changer for Brexit. All of these studies focus on cases in which the polity has been a direct victim of terrorism, and an attack on Brussels is not an attack on London, at least as far as the average British voter is concerned. Moreover, the terrorist attacks in Brussels didn't teach anyone anything fundamentally new.

I'm just revisiting my earlier forecast and trying to determine whether there are good reasons to change my mind or to stay put. The polls remain pretty evenly split, with those who want to remain in the EU slightly outnumbering those who want to leave[a]. The betting market gives, as of this writing, Britain a 55% chance of remaining in the EU[b], which is more-or-less in line with the polling numbers. The GJ take on things, however, is the odd man out. It's consistently forecast a 75% likelihood that Britain will remain in the EU, though just in the last few days it's dipped to 72%[c]. Now, we're starting to see elites - especially from the conservative side of the aisle - start to freak out in much the same way that Republican party elites are doing so over our Trumptacular presidential primary here in the States. The Financial Times, for example says that \"Britain is heading for Brexit\"[d]. And Fortune interprets the departure of Ian Duncan Smith as the beginning of a Tory \"civil war\"[e]. Smith's protestations that his departure has nothing to do with his sympathy for Britain's withdrawal from the EU have convinced few if any[f]. Guys, who ya gonna believe, me or your own two eyes? The best reason (as far as I can see) for thinking that Britain won't leave the EU is that it would be giving itself the gift of an economic disaster: \"Leaving the European Union would cause a serious shock to the UK economy that could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household \u00a33,700 worse off by 2020, a report commissioned by the CBI business lobby group has warned. In a stark warning, an analysis conducted by accountancy firm Pricewaterhouse-Coopers for the CBI said that Brexit could cost the UK economy \u00a3100bn \u2013 the equivalent of 5% of GDP \u2013 by 2020 and would cause long-lasting economic damage from which it would never recover\"[g]. Okay, you convinced me, friends. But it's not so clear that the British median voter is going for it. Reasons to think that people vote for their economic self-interest have been hard to find recently in English-speaking democracies[h].  So I'm changing my forecast slightly to be more closely in line with both the polls (about which I'm leery given some less than spectacular results of late) and the betting market.  -- [a] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/11617702/poll.html [b] http://www.oddschecker.com/politics/british-politics/eu-referendum/referendum-on-eu-membership-result [c] https://www.gjopen.com/questions/149-will-a-majority-of-voters-in-britain-s-upcoming-referendum-elect-to-remain-in-the-european-union [d] http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/35bef41c-ecfe-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8.html [e] http://fortune.com/2016/03/21/british-government-brexit-divisions-eu/ [f] http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-brexit-debate-2016-iain-duncan-smith-says-resignation-not-about-referendum-2339816 [g] http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/brexit-could-cost-100bn-and-nearly-1m-jobs-cbi-warns [h] http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/opinion/sunday/voting-and-self-interest.html"], [22688, "2016-03-21T21:23:21Z", [0.85], ""], [22686, "2016-03-21T21:21:47Z", [0.54], ""], [22676, "2016-03-21T21:08:06Z", [0.78], "From day one the Leave campaign has been exceptionally muddled and ineffective.

However, just 15% of Labour supporters and 9% of Lib Dem supporters concur.

It looks like Remain has the edge, historically. A careful reading of the Wikipedia page on secession (Sorry, couldn't find another list) turns up arguably 20 unsuccessful secession movements, versus 16 successful[1], giving a historic base rate of 55.55...% There is reason to be uneasy about the pollsters. In the 2015 General Election, the pollsters failed to predict the outcome. There have been many post-mortems of this, but it could simply be that they got it wrong due to chance. Everyone gets things wrong from time to time due to chance. So, assume the polls have a 5% chance of getting the outcome wrong. Current polls[2] place it at 51% to remain in the EU, but it's hard to apply Bayes Theorem, since we don't know the likelihood of the polls outputting this condition! I do, however, take on board @AndrewSabisky's caution against putting too much emphasis on these numbers. Further, the Telegraph stated that \"Leave voters are more likely to say they will show up \u2013 79 per cent say they are certain to vote if the referendum was held today \u2013 whereas 72 per cent of Remain voters say the same. Taking this into account, Leave (52 per cent) has a seven point lead over Remain (45 per cent).\"[3]. This gives leave edge in a departure from the historic tradition! On the fourth hand, people are generally risk seeking with regards to potential losses and risk averse with regards to potential gains[4]. I think that people are more likely to take the \"sure thing\" of existing economic and political situation, even if the expected rewards of leaving are greater. This does assume that the public see the referendum in these terms. Maybe fear will overcome some of the Leave voters when they're actually in the booth? Averaging the 3 data points above gives us a probability of 50.51%. I think that we should bump it up due to Kahneman's prospect theory, and potentially even some more due to the reasonably heavy media campaign for remaining. However, we should not get overzealous and bump it up by too much. I give it a 56% chance, all in.

It is an interesting point in the emotionally charged Brexit debate. That is, an \"out\" vote complicates the  coordination for future military intelligence, mutual financial contributions but,  more critically, coordination for terrorist activities within EU borders.  Beyond this basic point, the ETH does NOT go.  The following is simply a synthesis info w/in the public domain &,  supposition based on historical events that, the probability of a Brexit actually could indeed hasten the onset of even greater EU issues:  On the one hand, it is an  already arguable position that Euroland been unable to archive a viable - ready to act when necessary - multi faceted military capability on large issues to protect  its surrounding borders. Too many Countries (28) create a nearly impossible mean reversion to act decisively when controlled by the Germans, French; especially on hot button issues such as immigration.  Money yes, military confrontational forces no. Putin has known this for a while.  He has taken advantage of this fundamental weakness. He has gained indirectly good will from not significant geographical quarters in the Ukraine. He thereafter took outright control in Crimea. More quickly than any world power anticipated. We all just watched.  So, what is v/ clear is the ....EU IS capable of lots of bluster but,  very little concrete action. This has resulted in providing Putin the upper hand in the Ukraine & the, giving him a concrete opportunity to exercise a  state of art hybrid war scenario take over of Crimea. He exercised this act w/ blinding speed  &, incredible efficiency knowing \"faster is better\" &, just wait to see if \" a world power wants to take the risk of going to war\" over Crimea.!!?? The world watched, again.  NB: Merkel's increasingly weak political position in the BDR ( due in great part to her immigration stance) leaves a classic \"strong deterrent\" factor at major risk for the EU. Increasingly, those that care are beginning to wonder, seriously about the EU exercise.  Putin knew Merkel's weakness would leave her hands tied by her EU counterparts w/ significant economic & trade ties w/ Putin.   He speculated Merkel would clearly be successful at pushing through economic blockades, sanctions et cetera but, 0000 military action. No way. And, so it has been.  COPY PASTE Syria inasmuch as EU's foot dragging on troop deployment, and lack of  significant hardware &, support to Rebels battling  against to the Asad  regime. This  fact provided Putin the window of military opportunity to achieve what now appears a much stronger bargaining hand on the future of Syrian relations w/ various interests.  ETH here in ZH makes clear a Brit exit complicates the situation considerably. My initial reaction is : from the perspective of Scandinavian & Swiss success due to 100s of bilateral agreements, the an exit vote for the UK,  has a  high probability of testing the fundamental purpose of the EU.

It is also important to note that, to this point, the average number of \"I Don't Know\" (IDK) respondents has been around 15% and this poll only had that number at 4% While I have made a small adjustment downward in my forecast I think this may be overreaction more that anything:\n1) again this is the FIRST telephone poll to suggest Leave is in the lead\n2) the pollster ORB has only conducted online polls for this topic to this point their recent online polls now have leave in the lead while other pollsters either have remain or a dead heat.\n3) ORB's previous online polls never let room for undecideds, voters had to choose Leave or Remain. It could be that undecideds moved from Remain to IDK on this poll, but we don't know This poll also provided more data on intention to vote. The Telegraph headline, and their commentator Sir Lynton Crosby are suggesting that this is where the rub is and that when you factor voting intention in the Leaves carry 52% to 45%. Again, given while I think this is an important data point it is the first phone poll to show this so we need to take it with a grain of salt. So, moral of the story, slight revision down but need more confirming evidence that this is a trend.

I am basing this forecast on the fact that both online polls, phone polls, and betting markets are all above 50% for remain, ex undecided, and that since the February 22nd announcement there has been relatively little variability around these numbers, with remain gaining ground. I will be monitoring polling closely, however, as this will be the biggest indicator to how the public is internalizing the arguments of the various platforms.\nPhones: 51% to 39%\nBidding Markets 60% v 40%\nOnline Polls: 52% to 48% \nPoll of Polls: 51% to 49%\nLeaving an economic union like the EU is a pretty rare occurrence, and very rare for a large stable country like the EU. The only examples of countries actually leaving the EU (actually its predecessor the EEA) are Algeria, which declared independence from France, Greenland, which remains a dependency of Denmark which is a member of the EU, and Saint Barthelemy an overseas department of the French government. None of these are even remotely comparable to the UK. OPEC has had some defections although OPEC is not an economic community in the way the UK is, most defectors have returned, and generally the defectors are weak nations that feel they are not getting much benefit from OPEC despite paying large fees. Other examples of states/Economic union break ups seem to be rooted in ethnic struggle, which is not something we are seeing with the UK. Thus, there is limited historical precedent for an event like this. \nThe EU has a long history of euro-skepticism in government that ultimately gets shot down. In 1974 the ascendant Labour government had campaigned on a promise to hold a referendum on EEC accession. The ensuing debate looked remarkably similar to today\u2019s debate. The Labour cabinet was split on supporting remain vs leave. Ultimately a new agreement with the EEC was reached and, in the first nationwide referendum ever, the British people overwhelmingly voted to remain a part of the EEC. Certainly Britain\u2019s economic position relative to the rest of Europe was a bit different in 1974 than today but it is interesting that the tone and nature of the arguments seems to be so similar. \nThere are three things that have me concerned as I watch this:\n1)\tPolling credibility. After both the Scottish referendum and the 2015 Parliamentary elections polling in the UK was more or less shredded from a credibility perspective. For one, they were flat wrong, and two there were significant differences between online and phone polling. It will be essential to monitor the volatility of these series and their direction going forward. \n2)\tThe arguments being posed by both sides are not salient to real voters. The Remain campaign\u2019s website has a few snippets with limited additional factual evidence. There is a seemingly credible element about the true \u201ccost\u201d from a dollars and cents (I know they don\u2019t use dollars) perspective to leaving the trade union and how it would hit the pocket books of consumers, otherwise it is pretty weak. The leave campaign, while disorganized, has arguments that a much more salient for individual voters. I am also having trouble reconciling some of this trade stuff. Goods trade appears to be covered by the WTO and remain campaigners suggest that services will not be covered, but as signatories to the GATT the UK and EU are signatories to GATS as well. So how will single market access for services be affected? \n3)\tMy small sample of Londoners amongst whom I have conducted my own non-scientific polling are all pretty pessimistic. The most common line of reasoning I hear is \u201cIf you were the UK today would you vote to join?\u201d that\u2019s a red herring but people don\u2019t seem to care. \nThe Remain campaign is going to have to convince the undecided voters to vote to remain in order to secure victory. I think that there will be some moderate success there but current polling seems to be pretty clearly signaling remain. I think that the volatility of the current polling, although they may be somewhat unreliable, is what will drive my forecast going forward. \nSome Links (many of which I pulled from previous forecasters)\nhttp://www.strongerin.co.uk/#QBqTe6zczyKQEf4J.97\nhttp://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/briefing_newdeal\nhttp://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/\nhttps://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/03/05/yougov-view-remain-ahead-support-fundamentals/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum,_1975\n"], [9549, "2016-03-14T14:28:52Z", [0.25], "The pension overhang in the eu is so large that the uk will decide to avoid a dying horse.

By the time the referendum comes around it will be high summer in the regions and the numbers will far outstrip the numbers arriving in September 2015.  More like 2 million.  This will unsettle the British further, realising that, given Germany is desperate to increase their population, will not return the majority of the so-called asylum seekers and in 2-3 years will be granted German and defacto EU passports.  Though many Syrians are caught on camera saying that their final destination is Germany once in possession of an EU passport they will be free to move to the UK (which in reality is their destination of choice) and the British are aware of that, and aware of the fact that due to free movement they are incapable of stopping migration into the country from EU passport holders. 2) The closer we get to the referendum the greater the pressure on the government to release the real migration figures, which will show that the International Passenger Survey figures were wrong (which was demonstrated when compared to the number of National Insurance numbers issued).  When the electorate are made aware of how many people actually entered the country this will further the resolve to vote to leave. 3) Increase in the number of high-profile and cross party names backing Brexit increases a sense of security in voting leave.   4) Negative and insipid 'stay' campaign. 5) One week after the referendum the EU will vote on allowing Turkey more freedom of movement within the EU.  Turkey has become more unstable and under the control of an increasingly Islamist movement that does not jar with the culture or ideologies of the EU.  Also, the UK fears a further mass migration of non-Europeans from the Muslim-majority country.  Turkey will use freedom of movement as an excuse to push Kurds out of their country, as well as grant the millions of asylum seekers from Syria Turkish passports allowing them free movement into Europe.   6) Given the wave of violent and sexual attacks from the majority young male asylum seekers witnessed in Sweden, Denmark and Germany Britain will not want to see this repeated either a) Turkey's free movement as part of their accession process or b) Germany granting asylum seekers German/EU passports as they struggle to handle the one million plus migrants they promised to take on. 7) More business leaders are coming out in favour of Brexit (e.g., John Longworth, the Chair of the British Chambers of Commerce). 8) Big businesses have stated that they would NOT leave the UK if the British voted to leave the EU (e.g. Toyota) 9) history and the aims of the European Project point towards an ever closer political and monetary union - one that the British will not subscribe to."], [22222, "2016-03-14T10:17:45Z", [0.53], ""], [22113, "2016-03-14T09:19:11Z", [0.85], ""], [22216, "2016-03-14T06:07:26Z", [0.77], ""], [15555, "2016-03-14T05:50:14Z", [0.95], ""], [21459, "2016-03-14T03:10:05Z", [1.0], ""], [102, "2016-03-14T03:00:03Z", [0.76], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/gitrep-13mar16pm/"], [15923, "2016-03-14T02:21:39Z", [0.65], ""], [135, "2016-03-14T01:53:31Z", [0.65], "The situation with migration and the unfortunate deal Merkel has struck with Turkey (even if, as likely, other European capitals thwart it) plays well for the Leave camp."], [6303, "2016-03-14T00:59:49Z", [0.93], "Sentiment still favors staying in the EU."], [15552, "2016-03-14T00:16:06Z", [0.9], ""], [538, "2016-03-13T23:59:22Z", [0.95], ""], [14314, "2016-03-13T23:34:57Z", [0.55], ""], [501, "2016-03-13T23:04:31Z", [0.75], ""], [21702, "2016-03-13T22:55:18Z", [0.9], ""], [21030, "2016-03-13T22:53:55Z", [0.75], ""], [22186, "2016-03-13T22:38:50Z", [0.55], "In the end swing voters will err on the side of caution and stick with what they know, but it will be closer than most people think due to the public opinion around immigration.

The media is largely anti-EU. Half the Tory party is anti-EU. Both leaders of the Tories and Labour have at best luke-warm support for the EU. London a key pro-EU voting area, has just seen Boris Johnson come out against the EU (where he is very popular despite the city being fairly liberal).  The pro-EU groups - liberals, and Blairite labour, have essentially been completely eliminated from contemporary British politics, so will have limited influence. The Scots are pro-EU, but this could backfire, if southern English conservatives see the EU as a something the Scottish like, so therefore they should dislike it on principle. A similar problem lies for the business lobby, in that big business is pro-EU, however, again if it pushes too hard it would be seen as 'interfering' in the people's will - big business is not popular in the UK. Small businesses are less involved in foreign trade, so will vote more in line with general cultural views on the referendum, rather than being a pro-lobby so to speak. A few key pro-EU voting groups will also be excluded or minimised from the elections. Ex-pat Brits, who you would assume are generally more pro-EU, especially those living in the EU, are not allowed to vote in the if they have lived away from it for more than 15 years, whilst those who legally are still allowed to vote will find it extremely difficult. Voting from abroad in UK elections is very difficult. Similarly, another more pro-EU group would be young people, students and young professionals.  Most don't live in owned-properties, and instead rent, and move regularly, making it more difficult to register to vote, so tend to have lower voting statistics.

Being a Scot in Scotland and so also witnessing the events of that referendum firsthand, I felt that two things had an enormous amount of influence on the outcome which may draw a parallel with this referendum, and these were the media coverage of events and the economic arguments, both of which in 2014 seemingly affected Scotland to vote marginally to remain in the UK and both of which I believe will sway the British people to remain in the EU.  Media coverage of Brexit in the big papers has so far seemed to carry a (sometimes tacit, sometimes not) sentiment against leaving the EU. The politically centre-left and highly influential newspaper the Guardian has published several editorials explicitly stating the paper's stance against Brexit. The Telegraph, which is centre-right, has remained silent on the issue, but being one of the UK's most prominent right-wing voices, it is telling that they have not made their stance clear. The Independent is also explicitly against Brexit, as is the Mirror. The Sun has sort of come out for Brexit, ridiculing Cameron's negotiations on the front page recently, as has the Mail, and while this may sway some people, I don't think that there's enough unanimity on the issue for it to be decisive, and I think that what the Sun and Mail might be doing is using this to attack Cameron and his policies and negotiations, rather than actually voicing explicit support of Brexit. There's also been a lot of coverage on why Brexit would economically damn the UK. Recently, 36 FTSE 100 companies have signed a letter stating that the UK would be better of remaining. While no one really likes to listen the the corporate guys, this is undoubtedly going to have an impact on the vote: people are less likely to elect for change when it rocks the economic status quo. However, with that said, there has been growing right-wing, nationalist and anti-EU sentiment in the UK over the last few years, which has been reflected in unprecedented levels of membership for UKIP, and which can be seen in the Yougov polls which have been seesawing slightly (https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/03/05/yougov-view-remain-ahead-support-fundamentals/). However, Yougov has also indicated that four polls in succession have seen Remain coming out on top, and while we might be quick to dismiss the accuracy of polling in light of the disastrous predictions of the general election of 2015, it should be noted that the issue of accuracy in that event stemmed from the \"Blue Shame\" phenomena of people not wanting to admit that they were conservatives. This series of polling will be less (although not completely not) politically sensitive for many people, and so it should be a pretty accurate reading of popular opinion.  Additionally, I think that the odds are politically stacked against Brexit: there are only three pro-Brexit parties  (the Democratic Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice and UKIP; 8, 0 and 1 seats in the House of Commons respectively) and although they have a degree of popular support and following (DUP is the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland and UKIP had more votes than the SNP in the general election, and only lost out due to the first past the post system) they remain rather fringe parties on the grand scale of the UK political arena, with relatively small voices. This, of course, is not to say that anyone who voted for one of these parties will abide by the official position that they hold on any issue, but it is always useful to look at the political support that any issue holds because politicians do have the ability to bring their supporters to their side. In this case, the political support for Brexit seems to be very small. The SNP, who hold all but three of the seats in Scotland, oppose Brexit. So do the Labour party, who are uncharacteristically united on the matter. The only party with no official position on the matter is the Conservatives, and even then, the Prime Minister has voiced his desire for the UK to remain in the EU and the divide of opinion in the party is causing a mush publicised split. To top all of this off, I like to look at the bookies whenever there's a major political event underway to see what the professionals think. Currently, most bookmakers in the UK have the EU referendum scored like something to the effect of 1/3 to Stay and 9/4 to Leave, meaning that they overwhelmingly think that the UK is going to stay. Because of this, although I think that it will be a closer call than many expect, (possibly a 40-60 to 45-55 ), I think that the UK will vote to remain. \n"], [20650, "2016-03-08T15:33:21Z", [0.51], "Basic considerations will prevail.

Although the Scottish Devolution referendum of '79 was actually a narrow vote FOR change, it just didn't qualify because the CHANGE vote was not greater than the 40% of pop. required.\nIf I include that as a CHANGE vote, I get 55% STATUS QUO votes. \nThe problem with the UK is that there simply aren't enough referenda historically to create a large enough sample size for me to be confident that it is representative. \nIf I look at Australia, there have been 44 referenda since 1906, 82% of which have been votes for the status quo. \nGiven differences between Australia (and the nature of the referenda there) and the UK - I'm going to give the Australian sample a 1/3rd weight and the UK a 2/3rds weight. That gets me back to 64% STATUS QUO vote.  THE INSIDE VIEW\nGenerally, it appears to me that it is hard to get people to vote for CHANGE via referenda. It is even harder to get them to vote for change where there is a significant risk that CHANGE will make them worse off. \nOn the basis that exiting the EU has clear negative risks (e.g. the GBP has already down from the mid 150's to high 130's vs the USD), I would bump the YES vote up substantially. \nA Feb 21-23 Yougov.com poll suggests that voters believe the REMAIN vote is the safer option by a 12 point lead. There is still a significant minority who believe it makes no difference, however. \nIn an environment of no exogenous shocks, my inside view is that a REMAIN vote on June 23rd is about 90%. \nHowever... THE TERRORISM RISK\nOUTSIDE VIEW:\nOne factor which could cause a dramatic shift in the vote would be if there was another terrorism attack or significant adverse event related to immigration, such as the Cologne sexual assaults by refugees, either in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. \nThis could cause the \"undecideds\" and/or the \"no difference [to my economic wellbeing]\" crowd to swing to the NO camp.\nSo what is the chance of an ISLAMIC terrorist attack in the UK over the next 4 months? (I assume a terrorist attack from another group would not effect the outcome of the vote).\nStatistically, it is miniscule (just over 1%). [I used Wikipedia history of terrorist attacks across Europe since 1958].\nThe chance of a non-specific terrorist attack somewhere in Europe is significantly higher:\nI'm going to define a terrorist attack as a significant attack, killing more than 5 people. Since 1958 there have been 33, meaning a 57% chance in any year and a 19% chance in the next 4 months. \nThen I wondered whether there is any seasonality to the attacks - in total, there isn't. As you would expect, exactly 33.33% of all attacks have occurred in the months of March, April, May and June. \nHowever, if you look at the seasonality of larger than median attacks (killing + injuring greater than the median of 5 people) the Mar-June period is about 50% less likely to contain an attack in Europe than average would suggest.  So now I have the stats, what do I do with them? (INSIDE VIEW) Basically, I'm going to give them very little weight - why?\nLet's assume there is a terrorist attack claimed by ISIL next week. \nIf I were David Cameron, I would use that to swing the argument to portray the attack as an attempt to cause Brexit and make impassioned speeches in the vein of \"Don't let the terrorists win\". There is also some history of leaders gaining substantially in the polls post attacks... therefore, I'm going to assume this would actually help the REMAIN camp as voters swing behind Cameron and vote \"against the terrorists\". \nThere is also the stat that 55% of voters think Brexit would make no difference to their safety, while only 16% think there is less risk, 10% think there is more risk and the balance are undecided. \nIf I'm right, a terrorist attack in the UK would improve the odds of REMAINing in the EU, but the chance of it occurring are tiny. \nI'm not convinced that an attack on European soil would swing the vote either way, although I guess you might get some Solidarite` emotive REMAIN \"I stand with Europe\" vote swing if it happened.  PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:\nI'm going to give the outside view a small weighting, given the significant economic unknowns created by a NO vote in this circumstance (20% weight). \nI'm going to give my inside view a huge weight of 80%, given the compelling reasons I can see not to vote NO and the potential YES vote sitting in the more granular polls (i.e. \"which is the lower risk option\").\nCHANCE of YES vote = 84.8%"], [14331, "2016-03-08T02:55:48Z", [0.97], ""], [21722, "2016-03-08T02:34:21Z", [0.77], ""], [11555, "2016-03-08T01:30:27Z", [0.8], ""], [21789, "2016-03-08T01:25:36Z", [0.58], ""], [21787, "2016-03-08T01:15:39Z", [0.71], "Business as usual until US election then revisit"], [14296, "2016-03-08T01:12:39Z", [0.82], ""], [21781, "2016-03-07T23:47:23Z", [0.87], ""], [1245, "2016-03-07T23:28:08Z", [0.79], ""], [21778, "2016-03-07T23:19:18Z", [0.83], ""], [100, "2016-03-07T22:51:13Z", [0.96], ""], [20209, "2016-03-07T22:41:02Z", [0.85], ""], [21449, "2016-03-07T22:09:04Z", [1.0], ""], [21772, "2016-03-07T22:07:09Z", [0.61], ""], [532, "2016-03-07T21:07:52Z", [0.8], ""], [21756, "2016-03-07T21:00:28Z", [0.75], ""], [21763, "2016-03-07T20:51:56Z", [0.75], "Even though they have maintained a seperate currency, the Geographical proximity will mean that they will remain part of the EU.

Traditionally, referendums tend to favour the status quo. Whilst there are powerful voices calling for Brexit, the uncertainty of what would follow in its wake is perhaps the biggest factor at play, especially as the arguments both, for and against, are unclear to many. Even electoral experts are beset by a number of unknowns, hence the absence of decisive arguments on either side. Another factor to consider is that Scottish nationalists will favour the retention of the UK's EU status as many see it as an easier route to independence. The merit of this position is debatable in itself, but nonetheless it seems to be a factor. When we consider that the referendum itself was a sop to the reactionary supporters of UKIP (and their potential Tory backers), the relative decline of their message since the election suggests that anti-EU feeling is less fervent than it once was. If the EU avoids an economic collapse and the fears over immigration begin to dissipate, general apathy towards the EU may help sway voters towards the status quo as discussed above. Furthermore, an increasingly belligerent Russia, and China, together with the declining economic condition in the former, might make the case for strengthening our ties with our largest trading and security partners, not  weakening them.

It's not like I'm saying something novel here[1][2][3].  But it can be difficult to disentangle the question \"Is Brexit a bad idea for Britain?\" from the question \"Will Britain vote for Brexit?\". I suppose I'd like to think that British voters will recognize their economic self-interest and the economic interests of the people with whom they currently share EU status. And I'd like to think that they will vote accordingly. But voters often put economic considerations in the background when making up their minds, as political scientists have known for a long time[4].  Perhaps the Brexit vote will play out in more-or-less the same way that the referendum on Scottish independence did. But before drawing a clear lesson from the 2014 vote, it's also worth remembering that (a) Scotland's population makes up only about 10% of Britain's, that (b) Scotland has been linked more deeply (in terms of gov't control) and for much longer to Britain than Britain has been to the EU, and that (c) the sorts of concerns that motivated (and still motivate) the desire for Scottish independence and not quite the same as those that motivate the desire for Brexit. For instance, partisans of Scottish independence did not seek, as far as I know, to combat the \"likely...fall in relative importance [of Scotland] in the world\"[5] as some Brexit backers do, mutatis mutandis. And certainly the anti-migrant rhetoric was not, to the best of my knowledge, a part of the argument for Scottish independence as it has been with Brexit[6]. Britain was my home for half a decade, and I don't won't to see her leave the EU, but that doesn't mean she won't. So for now I'm going to be keeping a close eye on the polls. -- [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-britain-leaving-the-european-union/?wpmm=1&wpisrc=nl_wonk\n[2] http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-35696512\n[3] http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/brexit-could-drag-all-of-europe-into-disaster/news-story/492ee989ead828b0545745f7766f03bc?nk=7bb3d75d25149cb5709b9714e1164588-1457365425\n[4] http://www.jstor.org/stable/2110937\n[5] http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11968813/Three-reasons-why-Britain-needs-Brexit.html\n[6] http://time.com/4150676/david-cameron-european-union-brexit-talks/"], [21690, "2016-03-07T16:14:24Z", [0.65], ""], [493, "2016-03-07T16:11:01Z", [0.8], "Telegraph average of polls shows consistent lead for \"remain\" since September.

Quite often Krugman and Stieglitz (the big names in EU lately) are cited out of contest. Still the average citizen will not understand the matter completely.

This no longer seems true. Seen through the eyes of most voters, the stagnation and instability of the eurozone contrasts with Britain\u2019s economic recovery.\nThis comparison, alongside claims of economic competence and a turnaround, helped the Conservative Party win its first majority government in more than 20 years. Convincing voters that it is in their financial interest to cling to the eurozone is not as easy as it once was.\nIt\u2019s not only about economics; there is a cultural dimension, too. In the last election, nearly four million mainly white working-class retirees abandoned the mainstream in favor of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), a stridently eurosceptic populist party. The rise of UKIP, which campaigns as hard against an influx of European workers as it does for withdrawal from Europe, is a register of how immigration has moved to the forefront of Britain\u2019s debate.\nThen came the refugee crisis. Combined with angst over migrant camps near Calais, France, where hundreds are trying to enter Britain, recent headlines have pushed public anxiety about immigration to the highest level ever recorded. It is now voters\u2019 top priority, with nearly twice as many voicing concern over immigration as the economy.\nMuch of this was a long time coming, among an electorate that has never warmed to demographic change. Some of the sentiment is wrapped up with public anger over the failure of the Conservative government to fulfill its pledge, dating from the 2010 election, of reducing net migration to just 'tens of thousands' a year. The most recent figure available put net migration into Britain at an annual record high of 330,000.\u00bb\nhttps://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/why-brexit-looms-large#sthash.cwQKnHTn.dpuf\n"], [21299, "2016-03-06T17:13:26Z", [0.52], "Just over half are too conservative to allow the change"], [21255, "2016-03-06T16:20:50Z", [0.73], ""], [21256, "2016-03-06T16:17:10Z", [0.98], ""], [691, "2016-03-06T16:15:01Z", [0.8], ""], [15102, "2016-03-06T15:56:11Z", [0.69], ""], [21228, "2016-03-06T15:41:11Z", [0.65], ""], [21221, "2016-03-06T15:35:35Z", [0.55], ""], [21215, "2016-03-06T15:32:19Z", [0.95], "Most brits see the EU as a good thing even if it is has some drawbacks the free movement of goods and services has over the past increased the UK's wealth and it's economic growth."], [21181, "2016-03-06T15:19:51Z", [0.25], ""], [21181, "2016-03-06T15:18:31Z", [0.62], ""], [21204, "2016-03-06T15:17:27Z", [0.15], ""], [21181, "2016-03-06T15:17:20Z", [0.65], "As far as I can see, the EU has a hard time to balance different economic markets such as Germany and Greece.\nWe can expect the need for of efforts from the EU Member States  to help the weakest countries.

I think this creates a practical difficulty for a \"yes\" campaign--the benefits of EU membership are diffuse and it is not obvious (to me) to what extent they accrue to non-elites, so how will this be sold? External shocks, if they happen, seem much more likely to shift opinion to \"no\"--terrorist attacks, further migration crises, and the like seem more likely to trigger a preference for isolation.

What is most interesting (for me) at the moment is that there's a fairly large gap between what the betting market suggests is the right prior and what the polls suggest is the right prior. The betting market tells us that there's a 74% chance that Britain will vote to stay in the EU, and a 26% that she will vote to leave it[1]. But the polls are a different story. One source reports a poll of polls that shows that there is a 51% to 49% split for staying[2]. However, another sources report a different picture: \"Nearly two thirds of UK voters are sceptical about the European Union, but less than a third want to leave, according to new analysis\"[3]. The same course looks at the development of attitudes over time suggests that support for remaining in the EU has been growing over the last few years and is now roughly as high as it was in 1997. Betfair itself takes up the matter of the discrepancy between the market and the polls. Not surprisingly, it sides with the markets! But the discussion is worth reading and implies (if I understand it correctly) that, when Scottish independence was up for a vote in 2014, the polls initially suggested a fair amount of support for independence, but much of that support melted away as the date of the referendum drew nigh: \"The build-up to the Scottish Independence referendum of 2014 was fairly low key for almost two years. It was only after the SNP had gained considerable momentum, and independence became a possibility, that the campaign sparked into life and the majority of Scots (and politicians from south of the border) engaged with the question. Ultimately, voters decided to stick with what they knew and keep Scotland in the union. When uncertainty kicks in closer to June 23, the likelihood is that the millions of undecided Brits, who don't feel strongly about the EU either way, will choose to support Remain\"[4]. But I'm not sure that's how I read the data. Opposition to independence went from 61% in December 2013 to 55% in April 2014 to 51% in September 2014. So there wasn't really a trend in the polling away from being favorable to independence. Rather, what's relevant here is that the independence referendum was eventually defeated about 55% to 45%[5]. So - if the 2014 referendum is relevant here - the take away is not so much that we should expect the polls to narrow as we approach the Brexit vote. It's that we should expect the polls to indicate that there's more support for Brexit than the election will reflect.  And that might simply be because polling in Britain has not that predictive over the last decade or so[6][7]. (I hope I'm not being unfair to Betfair; maybe I just misread their point.) At this point, I think it's reasonable to afford the polls a 40% share of determining my prior and the betting market the rest, though I'll be hunting for better predictive measures.

It's unsurprising that the odds of Brexit have increased as campaign for the proposal has kicked into high gear. This article most succinctly evaluates the pros and cons of Brexit. The pros can be summarized as \"the same...\" while this author's three main points in favor of Brexit are:\n1. On past form, the EU will continue to stretch its tentacles wider and deeper into every nook and cranny of national life. Hence, the costs of its interference will rise substantially. Meanwhile, over time the EU budget will surely increase. After all, the logic of moving towards a closer union is that the central budget should outrank national ones.\n2. If most of the rest of the EU moves towards full fiscal and political union to make the euro work, it is going to be very uncomfortable for the UK to be inside the EU but outside that bloc. Whatever difficulties we have had over recent years in making our voice heard in Brussels are bound to get worse.\n3. The EU is likely to fall in relative importance in the world. Admittedly, the UK doesn\u2019t have to choose between trading with the EU and trading with the rest of the world. But if the rest of the world is continuing to grow in relative importance, then the benefits of EU membership would be proportionately smaller, and the costs yet more unnecessary. These are interesting from an academic perspective but essentially represent a nationalism argument and I don't think the EU is threatening the UK's sovereignty in any meaningful way to gather a lot of support for it. I will obviously follow this but my starting prediction reflects low probability for Brexit."], [20608, "2016-03-03T20:46:11Z", [0.6], "Embarrassingly, I misread the question the first time I made a prediction.

However unlikely the impact on Scotland may be, there is also at least a public perception that a Brexit would further complicate the discussion of Scottish Independence, which just adds more instability to the mix.  Cameron following through on offering the referendum can function in multiple capacities beyond just keeping his word among a domestic UK audience and among its partners abroad. Considering the potential negative economic impact of simply offering the referendum (e.g. some banks attribute Sterling devaluation to the referendum), in as much as it may be flirting with disaster, it should give the UK a glimpse into the future of the warm-/cold- reality of non-membership in EU.  Considering Cameron's original EU terms renegotiation and that his political longevity is directly tied to staying in the EU, plus his strategic concession to allow his own party members to decide on Brexit Yes/No independently offers him an  political dip-stick test into who in and outside of his party is interested in seeing him stick around. From now until the referendum the UK also has time to see if any of those interesting \u2018opposite of the expected effect\u2019 theories start to pan out; for example the argument from those who want to remain in the EU, that the Brexit makes bad economic sense just look at XYZ indicators has one anti-matter particle counterpart in the Barclay\u2019s theory that the departure of a major economic power from the EU, such as the UK, might destabilize the EU, thus making the UK a haven for increased foreign direct investment. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/11/brexit-vote-could-turn-uk-into-a-safe-haven-triggering-eu-disint/ . An uptick in FDI, or at the very least, expressions of interest leading up to the referendum, seems measurable/testable and there should be some indicators beyond just official figures to watch on this. The referendum also may function to flatter UK domestic audience sensibilities about its own special status in the EU--it's a costly gamble, and seems like playing with fire.   Will follow the money on this one and keep a close eye on UK economic indicators leading up to the referendum as crucial determinant to this forecast: GDP, trade figures, changes in financial forecasts/ratings, etc. the gloomier the market stats trend leading up to the referendum, and the potential lack of those \u2018opposite effect\u2019 theories to provide extremely extremely compelling arguments about the Brexit\u2019s long-term benefits will likely ensure the status quo and keep UK in the EU. The remain in the EU camp has it much easier, they have more actual historical data to draw from and only need to project a shadow of a doubt into the future to sway perceptions; the Brexit argument is much harder to make--will be watching for any extremely compelling arguments and equally compelling proof that they are part of the campaign circuit (i.e. out there), that there is grass-roots uptake of these ideas, and actions matched to exploit these opportunites--it's a tall order.

Questions: --Why @$#@ WITH A GOOD THING when your main FDI partners are already long-time EU members who may interpret leaving the EU as hostile act and whose increased investment may have been due to doors opened by the EU relationship; furthermore, the US, as a bit less than 1/3 of total FDI in UK investor has already expressed its opinion that it prefers the UK as an EU member\u2014to validate/negate the idea that leaving the EU would complicate the situation, we would want to address whether FDI investor parties are likely to share the same concerns as the various government entities and spokespersons. To determine this should somehow dig deeper into what types of projects are covered/not covered in official UK govt. reporting on FDI inflows. How much will UK FDI Stock, or the UK FDI brand suffer or at least wobble in the process, and during such a wobble how easily will the Brexit maintain domestic public support, as well as avoid pitfalls of often irrational market perceptions globally that notoriously avoid the long-term perspective and can sabotage a course of action before it\u2019s hatched.  --WHAT WILL BREXIT HYPOTHETICAL UK FDI INFLOW RESTRUCTURING LOOK LIKE You have to be realistic and assume that partners/nations who\u2019ve been making money, won\u2019t necessarily walk away from good UK investments (especially if you think the \u201cFDI stock\u201d perspective is the best measurement for FDI inflow health) unless their respective governments impose restrictions. And even then, there may be ways around such hypothetical restrictions (shell companies, indirect investments etc.) for a certain portion of the investments. Needless to say, the Barclays\u2019s argument is going to rely on some type of \u201crestructuring\u201d of that over 1000 BN GBP of \u201cFDI Stock\u201d although we need not assume that EU departure means all the US/EU/OTHER money will disappear, although potentially some of it might. What other funding would take its place when, hypothetically, the UK is liberated to draw up/negotiate new contracts with global nations individually, including with some nations that EU membership had precluded. At the very least, there are a lot of meetings to attend and a mountain of paperwork to be done;  the trust levels between business partners that have skyrocketed the UK into #1 FDI inflow position in the EU in only a few years took a while to build up and cultivate. Without assuming that a Brexit means that ALL of this EU/ USA /OTHER money will disappear, but perhaps only some, and other new funding may replace it (and beyond, as the Barclay\u2019s argument goes) will this FDI reconfiguring be enough to throw off track the UK\u2019s rapid rise from 8th largest inward FDI nation globally in 2013 to 3rd in 2015 (see Source: 2015 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index [5th chart down same link]). Address the hypothetical, if leave EU, what % of FDI (perhaps based on looking into types of projects covered in report) is likely to disappear; what restrictions currently associated with EU membership are preventing the UK from exploiting additional FDI? Considering the massive capital outflow from China, http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/13/business/dealbook/china-exodus-flows-currency.html?ref=asia&_r=0\nperhaps now is an opportune time to drop out of the EU and focus on the China money blitz before the birds circling overhead disappear.  Will mull this over a bit and see how else to triangulate existing FDI, the policy climate for FDI before and after hypothetical Brexit, and what other indicators might be used for further insight. 3/6/2016 Updates  Britain and the EU: A long and rocky relationship \nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26515129\n[Decent Quick Historical Context]--it seems that over the years UK leaders have used this sort of back-and-forth courtship ritual with their EU membership to cement their own reputations--it almost seems like a rite of passage for UK leaders to show their mettle; this makes it seem more likely that membership will stay, with likely some additional tweaking of the relationship.  Re: UK FDI Inflow Articles\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/02/europe-business-foreign-investment 3/9/16\nEU referendum: David Cameron to set out 'benefits for UK'\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35769809\nFrom this article:\n\"Vote Leave, the cross-party anti-EU campaign group of which Mr Grayling is a member, is publishing research on Thursday suggesting the UK has \"seemingly given up\" its right to veto any future EU treaty drawn up to cement the process of economic and monetary union across the eurozone.\"\nWill be looking out for the research that will be published Thursday. 3/15/16\nBrexit Most Likely to Win\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12193963/EU-referendum-Exclusive-Telegraph-poll-says-Leave-campaign-most-likely-to-win-in-June.html\nDon't find this compelling basically because it's a poll, and because of the very same reasons they attribute Brexit as having an edge: \"Analysis of the survey by Sir Lynton Crosby shows that voters who want Britain to leave the European Union are more motivated than those who say they are in favour of staying in.\"  Although the issue merits continued daily monitoring, (and inspiring people to stay tuned may be the media agenda behind this report), this article doesn't present compelling prove of a shifting tide. Honestly, either for or against party could be behind the agenda of this poll--it seems mostly about stirring the pot, waking people up. Will continue to watch.   The inherent problem with political polling seems to stem from--to posit an arm-chair theory--the mass tension generated by the collective asses of arm-chair political participants (not referring to participation in other aspects of life) worldwide, and the kinetic energy required for desperate politicians (whose daily-work is far removed from those asses and being mostly conducted indoors makes them too out-of-touch and out-of-shape to either kick ass or take names) to find people, to talk to, to get them to care, and then do something, while simultaneously thinking real interactions with people are too time-consuming. Instead of conducting ongoing interviews with a sample of individuals over time to appreciate things like life context to give some perspective on their consciously stated responses to questions, they want a short-term \"now\" index, or 'dip-stick' of where things stand, like cliff-notes for real interaction and understanding; in their busy-ness polls become an as needed all-in-one communications activity for cut-through, interaction, convincing, and motivation--but the entire interaction is short, low-quality, agenda-driven.

Forecasters have so far based their predictions of Britain remaining on two factors: economics and fear of the unknown. I have read every comment made so far, and I don't think I've seen one commenter whose reasoning I consider invalid. The prospect of Britain taking a severe economic hit and the frightening step into an uncertain future are real problems. The question is, how do people interpret these problems? When we talk about economic issues we tend to talk about macroeconomic issues. But from what I know, there's a lot of concern among native-born Britons over the \"Polish plumber\" problem; that is, unrestricted immigration from low-wage countries. This is an economic issue too; the concerns of the City of London may not figure prominently in the decisions of the electorate. This is not to say that macroeconomic matters don't affect people. Obviously these matters do. But if a voter is worried about unrestricted immigration endangering his wages or his employment, an appeal to macroeconomics won't work. And in fact, the voter may deliberately vote against the concerns of the City of London to spite people he feels have ignored him or undermined his own economic position.  As for the fearing the unknown, the long-term effect of immigration from continental Europe and the massive influx of asylum seekers is also unknown. There is the macroeconomic unknown, and the ethnic/nationalist unknown. The question is, which concern will govern people's votes? I think there is a good chance that voters will take the chance of economic turmoil in order to assert themselves as Britons. To repeat: from what I understand, many Britons already see themselves as enduring economic hardship. They will have to be sold on the idea that Brexit will make things worse, and I'm not sure that politicians and financiers who are already blamed for existing problems will be able to make a case that voters find convincing.

(h/t @AndrewSabisky --> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/154736) Andrew mentioned the importance of focusing on phone polls (not online polls). Another important links to remember for this IFP: Opinion polling for the UK-EU membership referendum (Wiki) --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum\n~ Also, a good summary of the state of play for this IFP with a couple of excerpts. March 1: \"What Is the Issue With the UK and the EU?\" --> http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2016/03/01/what_is_the_issue_with_the_uk_and_the_eu_102035.html What is the issue? The UK has long had a strained relationship with the EU and has never been comfortable with the ever increased drive for greater integration and harmonization of rules and regulations coming from Brussels. As the EU has grown, more decisions are made by a qualified majority. Previously decision required unanimity. The shift weakens the power of a UK veto. The UK Prime Minister has called for a national referendum on continued UK membership of the EU.\n[...]\nWhat will the UK decide? It is not clear. Many polls show a close contest. The event markets show a more comfortable lead for those who want to remain in the EU. PredictIt, for example, shows 69% to 31% favoring staying in the EU. Boris Johnson, the charismatic Mayor of London, has cast his lot with those who want the UK to leave, and this was seen as an important development. Roughly half of the Tory members of parliament want to leave, and, at least, five cabinet ministers have come out in favor of leaving. That leaves half of the Tory MPs, Labour and the Lib-Dems favoring continued membership. Big business and the banks support continued EU membership. Ironically, the more the UK establishment campaigns for the EU, the more it takes characteristics of an anti-elite movement.\n[...]\nIs there any precedent for the UK leaving the EU? Generally speaking, no country has left the EU, but there are a couple of exceptions, which, while interesting, are not really precedent. Greenland, a Danish territory, left the EU's predecessor the European Economic Community in 1985 (52 to 48 vote). Algeria, upon getting its independence from France in 1962, also left the EEC. The UK is the first country to hold a referendum to leave the EU. In 1975, the UK had a referendum on EEC membership. Then a little more than 2/3 of Britain voted to stay in the EEC. Trade issues dominated the discussion then. What are the consequences of a Brexit? It depends on the assumptions one makes. Those favoring the UK leaving the EU tend to play down the negative consequence. Some emphasize the positive that the EU is holding the UK economy back, that it the EU has too many rules that are costly. The UK will be able to reassert its control over it borders. Those favoring continued membership focus on the disruption of trade flows and the need to renegotiate an agreement with the EU. Norway and Switzerland, which are not in the EU and negotiated trade agreements with the EU have to adopt EU rules, including accepting EU immigrant, without having a say in the formulation of policies.\n[...]\nIs it about money or sovereignty? The UK is one of ten members of the 28 EU members that pay more than it receives from the EU. Both Germany and France pay more than the UK. The UK paid GBP18 bln to the EU in 2015, according to the Her Majesty's Treasury. Former Prime Minister Thatcher negotiated a rebate that amounted to about GBP5.0 bln last year. That means that real cost was GBP13 bln. But the EU also spent funds in the UK, some of which is paid directly to companies for investment and research and development. Last year was estimated at GBP4.5 bln. ~~~ COMMENT: From this point, my sense is that *stay* will prevail, but the Wiki's opinion poll aggregation doesn't look promising. At the same time, it's also common for things to tighten up around the 50/50 area with things like this.\n"], [14375, "2016-03-01T19:53:36Z", [0.8], "This is a tough one.
