If I correctly understand what the report says, then I'd expect some sort of positive response in the market. Checking Bloomberg just now, I see that it is up over 4%, at $422b. Ok: so far, so good. I assume that institutional investors parse quarterly reports and make decisions based on them. So, how long will that upward trend last? more than 8 weeks? Will it push the market cap over $430b? . . . . Frontline has aired a 2-part story on Facebook for the last 2 nights. Sobering. Not particularly complimentary. My takeaway from the program was that Facebook's leaders are a bunch of naive, idealistic young folks who have been blind-sided by their success into thinking that they could do no wrong. So far, what they've done to fix its problems seems to have been way too little, way too late. Facebook doesn't seem to be on top of its problems, yet. The midterms will be in a week. Half of the candidates will lose. The human tendency is to find someone else to blame. I think that Facebook will be the target of blame for every losing candidate:  that won't be good press for Facebook! Then, there's Mueller's report . . . .I anticipate it will include a lot of information about Facebook's involvement in the 2016 election: more bad press for Facebook. I think that the bad PR will counter whatever positive effect the quarterly report generated, so I don't expect much change in the next 8 weeks. Could it be over $430b? I think it could, but it could also stay under that. My understanding of the market is that it is not entirely rational.  It's based on perceptions as much as reality.  While reality may be good, the perception is bad.   Everyone I've talked to seems to think of Facebook as a necessary evil; they use it because they have to to keep up with friends, family and organizations in which they are members.  People are not doing Facebook because they love it.  Everyone I've spoken with wants to figure out how to spend less time on Facebook.  The happiest Facebook users are the ones with new apps that limit the amount of time they can spend on it.  None of that is good news for Facebook.

I'm forecasting on this question as a learning exercise."], [1333, "2018-10-31T18:05:23Z", [0.0, 0.57, 0.43, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2018-10-31T17:51:28Z", [0.0, 0.14, 0.86, 0.0, 0.0], "So Q3 is over. This was the last reporting until the end of the year. So what is the current status for FB? What I am interested in is Q3 results relative to expectations - this shows where the stock should be relative to where market analysts thought it should be before the results came out (notice I am not saying \"relative to where it was before the results\" because that's driven by market psychology in addition to analyst expectations and the psychology has been negative).\n- Earnings - FB beat the market's expectations by 20% (that's a lot).\n- Monthly and daily active users - FB missed expectations by only 1-1.5%. (the reported numbers still reflect growth relative to past numbers [4]. Much of concerns over FB have been about people leaving the platform and lower rates among young people) but it seems that FB is not doing all that poorly there. A concept that's important to remember I think is *network effect*: people have to be on FB because other people are on FB. This gives it a huge advantage and provides barrier to entry to competitors. \n- Revenue - 0.5% lower than expectations. This demonstrates that advertisers are still happy to use Facebook relative to expectations (it's still one of the best if not the best way for them to reach target audiences). \nSource: [1] The quarterly call also suggested that Facebook has plenty of growth potential when it comes to monetizing their Stories feature (which is growing and popular but FB still hasn't started taking advantage of the ad potential there). Other areas include Facebook marketplace and Watch. [2] As a result, the major Street analysts are still projecting FB stock to be higher (this is purely on the basis of fundamental analysis - i.e. what potential future earnings are). [3] Now, these kinds of \"analyst targets\" should be taken with a bucket of salt (they are to a large extent marketing materials for those companies and there are no major incentive structures to get those targets right. i.e. the targets are not meant as forecasts). Still they show roughly what these companies' fundamental analysis suggests the stock should be (under a number of uncertain assumptions). Anybody, correct me if that last sentence is wrong. I have never worked at an equity desk or known people who do it.  Conclusion - FB is a company with a lot of potential that is doing relatively well compared to analysts' expectations.

At the start of the year, 9.3 percent of the individual constituents of the S&P 500 index were in a so-called bear market - defined as stocks that have fallen at least 20 percent from their 12-month peak. By Oct. 22, the percentage had climbed to 34.1 and more than 70 percent of the stocks were in correction territory, defined as a fall of at least 10 percent. The return of the bears is even more pronounced outside the United States. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, 58 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI\u2019s global index are now in bear market territory.  The concern among some analysts is that the surge in securities hitting the 20 percent loss mark could lead to a tipping point and falls of a similar magnitude in overall indexes - which typically leads to a long-term downward trend. \u201cIt\u2019s really an indication that a global bear market has probably already started,\u201d said Albert Edwards, global strategist at Societe Generale. He said other technical indicators, such as the breadth of the market - the divergence between individual performances within an index - pointed to the same conclusion. Such rules of thumb about bear markets are by no means foolproof but they are closely monitored by money managers and investors for whom calling market turns correctly is paramount. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bears/how-bears-are-taking-over-world-stock-markets-idUSKCN1MY2EC"], [38, "2018-10-26T06:42:53Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], "https://thehill.com/policy/technology/413241-youtube-outpaces-facebook-twitter-in-clamping-down-on-misinformation \"YouTube is outpacing its social media rivals when it comes to curbing the spread of misinformation during breaking news events, while Facebook and Twitter are still struggling.\n. . . \nFacebook and Twitter have stumbled in the past to keep their platforms from being a clearinghouse for quickly disseminating unsubstantiated stories and armchair conspiracy theories that rapidly snowball in digital communities. But in the wake of major breaking news events this week, YouTube appears to have bolstered its safeguards for curtailing the rampant flow of misinformation. Facebook and Twitter searches for terms related to the migrant caravan and bomb scares auto-populated on Wednesday with conspiracy results pushing the claim that Soros is linked to the caravan and that the bombs are a false flag. Searching for \u201csoros\u201d on Twitter offered up the search suggestion \u201csoros caravan,\u201d while typing in \u201cbomb\u201d on Facebook yielded search suggestions such as \u201cbomb false flag.\u201d\n. . .\nYouTube searches generally haven\u2019t prompted users with such links. And when users search for conspiracies, most of the results are from vetted outlets on the center, left and right.  YouTube, which is owned by Google, said that\u2019s the result of a concerted effort on its part to reduce the flow of misinformation on its platform, particularly during breaking news situations. Albright said one possible solution for social media sites like Facebook and Twitter is to temporarily turn off suggested searches during sensitive situations.\n, , , \nYouTube didn\u2019t explain how it handles sensitive suggested searches but noted that over the past year its push to prioritize authoritative news based on its ranking system has helped it prioritize vetted outlets over obscure, conspiracy-pushing users in its news results. Aside from suggested searches, the results for such searches on Facebook and Twitter also returned videos pushing the conspiracy theories. On Wednesday, Facebook prominently displayed videos backing unsubstantiated claims underneath searches about the caravan and the bomb scares. Content from hoax peddlers was also easily accessible in Twitter searches.\n. . . \nDespite the commitments by social media giants to reduce the spread of misinformation, their platforms still allow for the the spread of false claims, in part because of how they\u2019re designed and the lack of efficient safeguards in place. Parts of Facebook and Twitter have become Petri dishes for conspiracy theories about the origins of the migrant caravan and the bombs sent to prominent Democrats and CNN. Certain groups on those platforms have circulated the idea that the migrant caravan is being funded by hedge fund billionaire and prominent Democratic donor George Soros, who was among the targets of mail bombs this week.  Those same online communities pushed theories that the attempted bombings were part of a false flag plot to make Republicans look bad ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections.\n. . . \nFor their part, Facebook and Twitter appear to have a growing understanding of the matter. The platforms cleaned up their search results on the caravan and bomb scares between Wednesday and Thursday, when searches that previously showed conspiracy as the top result instead showed results from Snopes and Factcheck.org. Search results no longer showed the conspiracy videos either.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I think it would matter to an investor that YouTube is out-performing Facebook when it comes to preventing the spread of fake news.\nThe value was $435b when I checked it just now.\n"], [19801, "2018-10-26T01:09:10Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Reacting after hours, Netflix dipped 1.9 percent and Facebook, which reports results on Oct. 30, lost 1.5 percent. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/nasdaq-confirms-correction-while-sp-500-and-dow-erase-2018-gains-idUSKCN1MY1LZ Facebook exodus: Nearly half of young users have deleted the app from their phone in the last year, says study\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/05/facebook-exodus-44-percent-of-americans-age-18-29-have-deleted-app.html Facebook Use Changing Among Young Users\nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/09/06/645140933/facebook-use-changing-among-young-users Facebook is for old people.

For market cap to go below $570B, shares would need to go under (570/612)*210 ~ $195.60. For market cap under $500B we need shares under (500/612)*210 ~ $171.60. The biggest dips FB has experienced in the last 5 years were Oct-Nov 2016 (~12.6% in 6 weeks) and of course the Cambridge Analytica scandal in Mar 2018 (~17.8% in 2 weeks) [1]. For FB to reach $570B would be a ~6.9% drop, and to reach $500B would be a ~18.3% drop. I believe this all but rules out anything below $500B. The figures above show that, even if FB experienced another scandal of the same magnitude as CA, we'd still expect the market cap to remain above $500B. And that's assuming FB won't grow beyond $210, which it probably will. What have analysts said? Back at the start of CA scandal, Morgan Stanley slashed price target from $230 to $200 [2]. Now, after CA has mostly blown over, a new MS analysis upgrades target to $215 [3]. Lots of other analysts are setting even higher targets [4]. And from the news I feel like scrutiny of FB has mostly died down. (I haven't been looking for FB stories specifically but I do check the headlines every day.) Now, $195.6 is 9% below the MS prediction; seems possible, if quite unlikely given the analyst consensus. So call it a 10% chance.

I see two reasons to think that is too high. First the P/E of most US stocks is higher than the historic norms, which suggests at some point US stocks can be expected to fall back to historic norms (they always say \"its different this time, they will not fall\", but they always do). The second reason is that Facebook's business model is having to change. The fact that the US politicians seems to have no idea what that business model was possibly indicates that some investors are equally ignorant, but it is clear that the world is changing. Users and regulators are taking a lot of interest in social media, \"free\" services, ownership of personal data, and who can do what with it, fake news, racist, sexist and illegal comments, interference in democracy, the high profits and low taxes paid by the companies. Facebook has so many users who spend so much time using it that the likelihood of more usage does not seem very likely, but even before the CA issue the hours of usage in the US was already dropping. And had dropped a lot among the younger age groups. There are reports that 10% of US user have left in the last few weeks (some may come back, other may leave). The average hours of use will probably continue to fall in the US and within the next year or two will probably start dropping worldwide. All social media companies will need to employ a lot more people policing their sites as they will increasing be required to clean up their act. If the US is slow to act the EU shows signs of forcing the pace (why not? Facebook takes business from European firms, but does not employ many Europeans or pay much European tax, making life uncomfortable for Facebook is a win/win for every European politician, believer in driving out fake news, and raising tax (or fines)). Other countries around the world will take note of the control that China has over social media, and wondering why they don't follow suit.  So bashing Facebook is something that liberals and conservatives can agree on. I don't think the Facebook investors have seen the train coming, they are standing on the tracks thinking nothing happened.
