Suburban Voters had one of the most striking impacts on the 2018 elections senate elections. This has the potential to continue in the new election especially in one of the most important counties Maricopa. I have not seen evidence to suggest there will be another shift in the suburban voter demographic. This competitive county has historically voted republican but recently switch during the 2018 election. This is likely due to a rapidly changing demographics but there has also been a  link to suburban voting trends. Historical voting patterns definitely support a republican candidate, however the incumbent's approval rating and polling has drop dramatically, 4 months away from the election. Even before the recent civil unrests and COVID-19, polling suggested that the incumbent would loose. On top of that, polling for the president in the national election has also fallen in swing state - Arizona. Based on the historical voting patterns in Arizona I believe that this race will be much closer than the current polling measures might indicate, however, most of the evidence still leads me to conclude that this election will result in a democratic candidate winning in November. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/politics/arizona-2020-election-democrats-republicans.html\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/arizona/\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-biden-ahead-in-arizona-kelly-trouncing-mcsally-in-senate-race\nhttps://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-15/biden-focuses-arizona-key-state"], [87094, "2020-07-01T01:53:52Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0], "Kelly is running well ahead [1,2].
