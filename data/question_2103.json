After complaints from the all the relevant parties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen backtracked on the same day, labelling the move as a mistake misjudgement blunder or mishap.\nSo, the answer is that this event has happened (for one day).\nHowever, assuming the intention of the question is for the triggering to last more than one day, I will suggest the following:\nArticle 16 does allow for unilateral action if there is \u2018serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade.\u2019\nThe Union and the UK shall use \u2018their best endeavours, in good faith and in full respect of their respective legal orders\u2019 which I suggest is deliberately vague.\nThe UK has threatened to pull out of the protocol over difficulties for the movement of chilled meats, medicines, pets and plants, among others. The EU have stated that cannot be renegotiation of the protocol. This suggests that a stalemate is in the offing with sabres being rattled.\nThere are perhaps other issues at play here due to Brexit and the Belfast peace agreement. The protocol which is a result of Brexit created a border in the Irish Sea that has developed into political eruptions coming into play in N.I. The Conservative government cannot be seen to help break up the Union of the UK and can (will) not allow for arbitration with the European Court of Justice which would defeat the object of leaving the EU. The Eu has insisted on the full complement of customs inspections that are not used in other border jurisdictions suggesting a degree of intransigence and perhaps an attempt to split NI from the UK.\nAny negotiations with the EU tend to go to the wire. Perhaps realpolitik and pragmatism to forgo a threat to trade will prevail.\nMerkel is stepping down and Macron\u2019s popularity is slumping with Presidential elections in April 2022, the chief antagonists against renegotiation of the protocol will be gone.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840230/Revised_Protocol_to_the_Withdrawal_Agreement.pdf  https://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/article-16-of-the-northern-ireland-protocol/  https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-55864442  https://www.fiettalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brexit-BulletinEU-backtracks-on-invoking-Article-16-of-the-Northern-Ireland-Protocol-as-part-of-coronavirus-COVID-19-vaccine-export-authorisation-scheme.pdf  https://www.thejournal.ie/article-16-oireachtas-5355662-Feb2021/  https://www.thejournal.ie/article-16-mairead-mcguinness-5358122-Feb2021/  https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/953561/northern-ireland-protocol-will-the-uk-trigger-article-16  https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/northern-ireland-protocol-article-16-and-eu-vaccine-export-controls/  https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55865539  https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/ireland-brexit\n"], [100664, "2021-08-21T06:57:37Z", [0.18], ""], [101031, "2021-08-21T06:50:24Z", [0.27], "Back in June Lord Frost announced the UK would not be triggering Article 16 of the protocol - which would allow it to suspend parts of the Brexit deal - before talks with Brussels He added that the government believed using it was justifiable, but said: \"Nevertheless, we have concluded that it is not the right moment to do so.\"\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-57911148\nSo is the right time before Feb?
