The procedure is designed to overcome paralysis, where a proposal is blocked by an individual country or a small group of countries who do not wish to be part of the initiative. It does not, however, allow for an extension of powers outside those permitted by the EU Treaties. Authorisation to proceed with the enhanced cooperation is granted by the Council, on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.

Here's a part that's especially relevant to this question:  \"Hungary presents a puzzle for the EU, as it prepares to roll out its first rule of law report assessing the bloc\u2019s 27 member countries on September 30 ... few expect it [the EU] to stop Orb\u00e1n\u2019s abuse of the rule of law ... while it [the EU] formally triggered Article 7 proceedings against Warsaw in 2017, it did not do so for Budapest ... It was only after the European Parliament acted in 2018 and formally triggered Article 7 that proceedings were started against Hungary ... There is a sense in the Council \u2014 even among some governments that dislike Orb\u00e1n's policies \u2014 that Article 7 should be avoided. The worry is that isolating a member country could put further pressure on the bloc even as it is still recovering from the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave\" [2]. If the past is any guide, then it's very unlikely that Article 7 proceedings against Hungary will be completed. But note that this question asks about Article 7.1, for which the bar is not that high: \"The mechanism begins with a proposal to find a 'Clear Risk of Serious Breach' of EU values either by the Commission, the Parliament or one-third of member states. This is then approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament.

Fidesz is the political party of the Hungarian President Orban and belongs to the centre right European People\u2019s Party (EPP) grouping within the European Parliament that includes Merkel and Veradkar. They do not want to isolate Orban due to his ability to supply votes and therefore maintaining the group\u2019s influence.\nThis was in April 2018.\nIn September 2018, the Eu Parliament voted to issue Article 7 (1) to Hungary, which opens the door to sanctions, but Article 7 can only be enacted if all the EU members agree, which is problematical as Poland is in a similar position to Hungary and they will support each other.\nThe EU is currently distracted by the Coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and the resultant budgetary woes.\nHungary has also become the largest recipient of EU aid to combat the outcomes of the pandemic even though the country suffered less than others within the EU Community.\nTherefore, the chances of Hungary being subjected to Article 7 would appear to be slim. \n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/europe-hungary-viktor-orban-coronavirus-covid19-democracy/609313/  https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/european-parliament-vote-article-7-teu-against-hungarian-government-too-late-too-little/  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-recovery-hungary-orban-idUSKBN24B1EB  https://whbl.com/news/articles/2020/jul/07/eu-executive-expresses-concern-over-hungarys-media-freedom/1036926/?refer-section=world  https://institutdelors.eu/en/publications/__trashed/  https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/parliament-draft-report-calls-for-infringement-procedure-against-hungary/  https://epthinktank.eu/2013/10/07/article-7-teu-a-mechanism-to-protect-eu-values/  https://www.democratic-decay.org/article-7-eu  https://www.dw.com/en/eu-parliament-votes-to-trigger-article-7-sanctions-procedure-against-hungary/a-45459720  https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/eu-deploys-article-7-against-poland-hungary-democratic-backsliding  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200109IPR69907/rule-of-law-in-poland-and-hungary-has-worsened  https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1271343/EU-coronavirus-news-Italy-Hungary-Viktor-Orban-cohesion-funds-latest-update\n"], [1034, "2020-07-12T22:23:36Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-07-12T11:22:12Z", [0.08], ""], [34815, "2020-07-11T02:24:19Z", [0.0], ""], [67403, "2020-07-10T20:50:59Z", [0.06], ""], [92452, "2020-07-10T18:43:00Z", [0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-07-09T23:58:30Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-07-09T13:44:18Z", [0.09], ""], [1333, "2020-07-08T14:43:46Z", [0.1], ""], [57778, "2020-07-08T10:14:59Z", [0.01], ""], [75863, "2020-07-05T15:52:35Z", [0.04], ""], [1034, "2020-07-04T23:32:09Z", [0.0], ""], [81370, "2020-07-04T16:40:59Z", [0.1], ""], [88954, "2020-07-04T15:15:23Z", [0.13], ""], [67403, "2020-07-03T15:22:12Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2020-07-01T17:07:43Z", [0.01], ""], [31275, "2020-06-30T20:15:41Z", [0.0], "Investigation yes but determination no."], [78237, "2020-06-29T15:52:59Z", [0.01], ""], [60948, "2020-06-29T13:01:58Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2020-06-29T11:31:47Z", [0.11], ""], [1034, "2020-06-28T20:49:05Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2020-06-28T18:05:37Z", [0.02], ""], [85144, "2020-06-28T09:13:43Z", [0.0], ""], [31251, "2020-06-27T08:00:51Z", [0.01], ""], [81577, "2020-06-27T05:40:06Z", [0.05], ""], [89038, "2020-06-26T21:02:20Z", [0.03], "Ship has sailed now decree revoked and European unity (even with Orban) the priority at moment."], [19127, "2020-06-25T20:33:38Z", [0.02], ""], [27661, "2020-06-25T17:05:53Z", [0.0], ""], [92704, "2020-06-24T15:07:40Z", [0.02], ""], [90457, "2020-06-24T14:24:04Z", [0.05], ""], [19127, "2020-06-23T21:01:10Z", [0.06], ""], [1034, "2020-06-23T19:59:48Z", [0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-06-23T17:35:17Z", [0.0], "Joining others in pegging my forecast for reasons they have stated."], [88452, "2020-06-23T15:18:29Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2020-06-22T22:02:28Z", [0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-06-22T14:52:57Z", [0.07], ""], [691, "2020-06-22T13:07:48Z", [0.02], ""], [60948, "2020-06-22T11:25:24Z", [0.07], ""], [37488, "2020-06-21T11:50:05Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2020-06-19T23:57:07Z", [0.0], ""], [32131, "2020-06-19T17:25:43Z", [0.1], "Adjusting down as rule by decree is ending; while Orban may keep the same broad authority, it is less likely that he would come into blatant conflict with the EU unless he does something very egregious"], [86678, "2020-06-18T17:19:26Z", [0.01], ""], [78237, "2020-06-18T14:46:31Z", [0.1], "Revising down as Orban looks likely to end his rule by decree soon which will drop the issue from the agenda.

In my opinion it is important to understand the procedure under that article of the Treaty.  It provides as follows: \"1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the European Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and may address recommendations to it, acting in accordance with the same procedure.\nThe Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.\" The trigger condition has already been met. Now, the question ask if 'the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2.' So, there needs to be consent of the EP.  That is likely to be given, having regard to the fact that the EP is considerably more active (and less constrained) on this issue, [2]. There also needs to be a majority of four/fifths of the members. (Poland and Hungary would vote for each other, [3], but that even with the rest of the Visegard group would not be enough, [4] . Finally, 'The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.'   This later point may provide an excuse for the Council IF Hungary has removed the emergency measures by the time of any Council determination.  It is clear that the Council is reluctant to condemn Hungary.  It has excuses available to it that would allow it to avoid doing so and/or to say that the situation no longer pertains which led to the reference, [3] Moreover, the Council struggles when it does not meet in person, [5]. Given that there has been no determination against Poland yet, or against Hungary in respect of the original reason for raising Art 7, despite the passage of years [6], [7] - amidst the Coronavirus crisis and the aftermath - I believe the Council will struggle to make space, or want to make space, for a divisive vote that might see Poland and Hungary try to leave the EU.

In theory, the EP doesn't have to pass another resolution in order for the Council to make a determination against Hungary although another one would probably pass anyway. I'm minded to believe that an Article 7.1 determination will happen but I'm not sure it will in the timeframe laid out in this question. The real question here is whether or not there is enough initiative in the Council to proceed with the charges against Hungary. The ECJ has recently ruled that Hungary broke EU law on asylum policy so there is a legal justification already there. I think the crowd is too low on the chances of this happening. In theory only one more stage needs to be completed, it's whether or not there is a will to do so. I don't think there will be sufficient will in the timeframe so I think this is unlikely to happen. Not many Article 7 issues have happened before in the EU and none have ever led to sanction or even recommendation but if Article 7.1 existed when Austria formed a far-right government they probably would have had a 7.1 determination so I'm going to use that as my base for this forecast (33%) and revise slightly upwards due to the political uncertainty right now - it's a very rough calculation but that's all I've got!"], [534, "2020-04-19T18:40:37Z", [0.25], ""], [534, "2020-04-19T18:38:54Z", [0.45], ""], [16727, "2020-04-19T18:09:28Z", [0.2], ""], [691, "2020-04-19T18:02:06Z", [0.05], "They definitely need to do this.

You need 4/5 of EU countries to agree to determine Hungary is in breach [1, 3]. This means you need 21 countries (out of the 27 minus 1 countries) for an agreement.
