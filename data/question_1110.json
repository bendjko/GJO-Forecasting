I have to abandon the update model used in [1] which failed.  It is a bit late, ha! However it is interesting to point out that the baseline forecast for the performance ratios used in [2] are\nDJ=1.09,  NASDAQ=1.14,  RU=1.10,  SP=1.08    based on statistics for mid-term election years. Performance ratios for DJ and NASDAQ this year are the same as the average mid-term years.  They are much better than non-midterm election years (which are DJ=1.03,  NASDAQ=1.02  RU=1.03,  SP=1.03). While my update model failed, it appears that the basic premise of better (significant) stock performance in mid-term election years wins another data point.  (I know, it is less than 20 data points since 1946, but still it is interesting and something to ponder about. )   I am sharing this information with @nigster, @Emil and @sreichau who participated in the original discussion in [2].

I believe that daily updates are not necessary since daily movements of the market are pretty random. In this model for updating the forecast, the 6-month rise rates for the indices in midterm years [1] are assumed to hold linearly over time.  The market rises from the update day to the end (31 July) are obtained by linearly interpolating the 6-month rise.  For example, from half way into the forecasting period to the end, the rises are half of the 6-month rises.  These interpolated rises, together with their standard deviations are used in Monte Carlo simulations to obtain performance ratios from the update day to the end (31 July).  The current (at the update day) performance ratios are added to the Monte Carlo simulation results.  The worst performing indices are then identified and their probabilities computed (similar to what was done in the baseline case [1]). Update for 1 March (29 days from start of the forecast period):\nDJ, NASDAQ, R2000, SP500:   27, 15, 26, 32.   Note that the forecasts for the 6-month period (baseline [1]) are 24, 17, 28 and 31, not that different from the updated forecast about 1 month later). For comparison, if non-midterm results were used, the forecasts are\n24, 27, 23 and 26. Rationale:\nWhile this update model assumes the 6-month rise rates, the incorporation of the current (at update day) performance ratios acts as an insurance policy.  I have contemplated daily updates but feel that they just add \u201cnoise\u201d in the forecast, and they will not help much in enhancing the forecast scores.   Of course there is a question of whether the rise rates behave linearly.  Examination of the 12-month and 6-month rise rates suggests that this assumption is reasonable.

Thanks to @Emil @nigster and @sreichau for interesting and useful discussions.  You can read all the discussions in [1]. There are two approaches to forecasting the challenge question, based on different assumptions/principles.  One is based on the market being random. This is used by @Emil in the Monte Carlo simulations, and by @nigster in his data-driven and data assimilation model.  The other is based on decipherable patterns in the market, used here and @sreichau.   Analyses have shown that in some situations, there are patterns in the stock market.   Since 1946, the US stock market went higher in next 12 months after each of the 18 midterm elections [2].  It so happened that the 6-month period in this challenge question is between 3 to 9 months after a midterm election.  So is there a pattern in the historical data that we can use to forecast this question? Daily market close data for all 4 indices between 1990 and 2018 from the Yahoo Finance webpage were analyzed.  The objectives of the analysis are to \n1.\tHow did the markets do 12 months after midterm elections and how did they compare with non-midterm election years?\n2.\tAnswer the same questions as in 1, but for a shorter period of 6 months since the forecast question deals with this shorter period.\n3.\tAnswer the same questions for a 6-month period spanning 3 to 9 months after 1 November (the specific period in the forecast question) for midterm and non-midterm years.\nNote that comparing midterm and non-midterm results is critical to the validity in using the midterm patterns in the forecast, as pointed out correctly by @Emil and @sreichau.\n\nA performance ratio for each index (end index divided by start index) for a given period (defined in questions 1-3) is calculated.  For convenience, 1 November is chosen to be the start date for midterm years.  The same date is also used for non-midterm years.  To make the analysis more robust (i.e. make it less dependent on the exact dates chosen), additional performance ratios for each index are calculated by moving the start dates up and down by one month resulting in 46 cases for each year analyzed.  In this dataset, there are 7 midterm years (excluding the last one in 2018) and 21 non-midterm years. Results: The mean performance ratios and their standard errors (in parentheses) for the indices are listed in the order of DJ, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and SP500. 12-month period (Question 1): \nMidterm years:              1.1521 (0.0055); 1.3386 (0.0134), 1.1897 (0.0100), 1.1547 (0.0058)\nNon-midterm years:     1.0769 (0.0046); 1.0828 (0.0069); 1.0841 (0.0055); 1.0731 (0.0051) Interestingly the market rose in 12 months independent of whether it is a midterm year or not.  However, the rise in midterm years are significantly higher (by about a factor of two or more) than in non-midterm years.  This confirms the article [2] and what @sreichau found for non-midterm years.  How about 6-month period results? 6-month period (Question 2) (from November to March the following year):  Midterm years:          1.1148 (0.0042);  1.1987 (0.0093);  1.1488 (0.0067); 1.1214 (0.0044)\nNon-midterm years;  1.0621 (0.0024);  1.0495 (0.0047);  1.0702 (0.0032);  1.0501 (0.0027) The market again rose for the 6-month periods albeit the rises are smaller than the 12-month periods for midterm years.  However, there is not much difference between the 6-month and 12-months periods for the non-midterm years.   Special periods (in the challenge question):  Midterm years:           1.0921 (0.0048); 1.1441 (0.0069); 1.1021 (0.0068);  1.0777 (0.0046)\nNon-midterm years:   1.0270 (0.0027); 1.0171 (0.0044); 1.0250 (0.0033); 1.0295 (0.0031) The market rose again for the special 6-month periods.  However, while the rise is 8-14 percent for the midterm years, it is only 2-3 percent for non-midterm years.   The 95% confidence limits are mean +/- 2 times the standard error.  The above analysis shows that the market rise in midterm years are different from non-midterm years for both 12-month, 6-month and the special 6-month periods.   To forecast the worst performing index in this question, the analysis results in the midterm years were used.  Monte Carlo simulations using the mean performance ratios of the indices and their standard deviations were performed.  The worst performing indices in the simulations were identified and their percentages were calculated.  The results are:\nDJ, NASDAQ, R2000, SP500:   \n30%, 12%, 30%, 28% This is the baseline forecast.  Just for fun, the worst performing indices in non-midterm years are\n23%, 29%, 24% and 24%. I will address how to update the forecasts in a different post.

If the markets and the indices were truly random, the probability of being the worst performer would be 25% for each of the indices.  But are they random?  Or do historical data show patterns that we can use for forecasting this question?   Analyses have shown that in some situations, there are patterns in the stock market.   Since 1946, the US stock market went higher in next 12 months after each of the 18 midterm elections [1].  This consistent rise after a midterm election is amazing and robust as it happened regardless of the ruling party and winning party in the midterm.  These 70 plus years spanned over booms and recessions too.  You can read the many hypotheses for the rising market after the midterms in the same article [1].   With this revelation in mind, the period in the forecast question has a special focus.  Instead of analysis ALL the historical data, I focus on the data around midterm elections.  Specifically I focused on the historical data in the 6 month period (January to July) starting from 3 months after a midterm election (January).  I looked for historical patterns that can help the forecast for this special period.  (Of course I understand that \u201cpast performances do not guarantee future results\u201d.)  Weekly closing values of the four indices from 1990 to present were obtained from the Yahoo Finance webpage for the analysis.  The data cover 7 midterm elections (excluding the last one in 2018).   Sure enough, each of the indices was higher 12 months after all of the 7 midterm elections.  This is a nice consistency check on the pattern described in the article [1]. Next I analyzed the data for time period in the question.  A performance ratio for each index at 3 months (31 January) and 9 months (31 July) after a midterm election is computed by dividing the latter by the former.  To make the analysis more robust (i.e. make it less dependent on the exact dates chosen), I also calculated additional performance ratios for each index by moving the dates up and down by 1 week and 2 weeks, resulting in 5 6-month periods for each midterm election, and a total of 35 periods for the 7 midterm elections analyzed.   The worst performance index in each period is counted.  The number of times that an index being the worst performer are:\nDJ: 14,  NASDAQ: 1, R2000: 12, SP500:8  and resulting in 40%, 3%, 34% and 23%, respectively.  (One can choose to analyze the daily closing values instead of the weekly values used here, but I suspect that this pattern will survive). It will be interesting to see the results when ALL the historical data were analyzed (instead of focusing on the midterm elections in here). I will use the above results in my forecast, fully realizing that \u201cpast performances do not guarantee future results\u201d.  Many people are arguing that this midterm is different from Trump. But is it?  The historical results are rather robust, spanning booms and busts, recessions and different presidents and parties in power.  We will see.

Some key facts of past Nasdaq bear markets: * On average, they have featured a decline of 39.74 percent over 248 trading days, roughly the length of a calendar year. * The median decline has been 32.25 percent over 266 trading days. * The great dot-com bust of the early part of the century still stands as the index\u2019s biggest and longest-lasting collapse. Nasdaq lost a gut-wrenching 77.93 percent over 674 trading days between March 2000 and October 2002. * The most mild bear market saw a decline of 20.37 percent over 44 days between Sept. 13, 1978, and Nov. 14, 1978. * The shortest one lasted just 34 days from Feb. 8, 1980, to March 27, 1980. The index fell 24.91 percent in that span. * Over its nearly 48 years in existence, Nasdaq has spent roughly 20 percent of the time - more than 2,500 trading days - in bear market territory. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-nasdaq-bears-factbox/factbox-past-nasdaq-bear-markets-lasted-long-and-cut-deep-idUSKCN1OK2AQ"], [67282, "2019-02-05T00:45:04Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.25, 0.35], ""], [35217, "2019-02-04T22:52:28Z", [0.38, 0.2, 0.25, 0.17], "Extended thinking from https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/824258 to look at the past 20 years, this gives:\nDow 35, NASDAQ 30, Russell 20, S&P 15\nLast 10 years: 40,10,30,20 Interestingly NASDAQ was the worst performer in only one out of the last 10 years (2016), and that year was very close with DJIA, NASDAQ and S&P almost in a three-way tie.
