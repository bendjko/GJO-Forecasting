Not sure if Packers would force him to retire (try to call the bluff) and then trade him in season or if they'll just trade him as soon as he misses a preseason game/training camp.  I think it's more likely than not but it's close. I think incentives for Packers will set in when they realize he's not coming back and they might as well get a haul of picks from the Broncos for him (assuming they're being truthful in that they won't fire the GM).
