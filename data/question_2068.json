Rerunning my 4cast using Winter's Method I obtain results that imply an increased probability for Bin4, so I'm changing my forecast.  I went back to the FRED MSP data and found a longer time series dataset for regression, but have abandoned this because of the strong seasonal component in the MSP that increases the error variance in the regression against CSHPI.  If I run 3 month moving averages of the MSP I definitely see a slow down there as noted by @JonathanMann.  So taking that into account I end up with a slight bias towards Bin4 over Bin3.

Adjusting this parameter to \"0.000745\" would have yielded \"268.2\", still slightly low, but that's as far as I'm willing to move it based on a single observation. \nWith these adjustments in place, the three-month average for September (356,667) multiplied by the \"0.000745\" parameter yields \"265.72\".\nWe don't have the median sales price data for October yet, but given the seasonal trends and looking at the past few months, I think it's reasonable to predict that it will be lower than September. With that said, I'll use the September number for October for now.\nBased on the stated assumptions, the three-month average for October becomes 354,433.

I'm shifting my forecast a little extra strongly towards bin 4 than I probably should, just for fun. (It should probably actually be 30%/70%.) I think this is my final forecast. @BayesianChimp @JonathanMann: While the MSP of existing homes peaked in June and has declined gently thereafter, I suspect that the S&P/Case-Shiller index will not peak in August because I suspect the upward trend in the S&P/Case-Shiller index hasn't fully ended yet. There is some additional information in the S&P/Case-Shiller index that is not captured in the MSP of existing homes, relating to the previous sale price of a home whose sale is used to calculate the S&P/Case-Shiller index. The S&P/Case-Shiller index always looks at prices in pairs, whereas the MSP is calculated based only on recent sales, with no regard to the previous sale price of any home. I believe it is likely for this reason that the S&P/Case-Shiller index has continued to trend upwards since Dec 2012 while never dropping so much as 0.5 in value from month to month (and in some years strictly increasing each month), while the MSP of existing homes has dropped considerably more percentage-wise at times since then. Thus, I would be wary of predicting that the S&P/Case-Shiller index will fall based on the fact that a 3-month moving average of the MSP of existing homes peaked in August.

Increase of 5.568 over May. Still a really big increase.\nThe Index has a seasonal trend of enhanced increases from March through July that start to taper off in August and declines after that, until the following March. This trend is superimposed on overall growth of the index and can be seen even in 2020 and 2021, except that growth didn't decline at the end of the summer in 2020. Will we see a decline in growth through the end of summer in 2021? One factor in favor of a decline in growth is that the economy is gradually returning to pre-pandemic activities; one factor against this is that new housing construction has faced shortages, and these bottlenecks may push more people into purchasing existing housing stock who would otherwise have purchased new homes. (No new homes are included in this Index.)\nThis feels like a bubble that will gradually pop as people have to go back to the office and won't want to commute to their suburban dream houses. But I don't think the bubble is likely to pop before October, especially as a lot of people continue to telecommute and high levels of Covid spread continue. And also, there is generally a housing crisis in the US, so in the end, maybe it will simply be a gradual slide rather than pop.\nAlso, the median home sale price is starting to plateau (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS), which can be a leading indicator for the forecast Index (see, e.g., 2005). A risk to consider is that we'll see a decline in the median home sale price for Q3 like that seen in Q3 of 2006; this corresponded to a fall of about half a point in the forecast index. However, as the median home sale price grew ~5% for July, I don't think a substantial decline in the median home sale price for Q3 or any decline in the forecast index is likely in the forecast period. But it is clear that the housing market is approaching some kind of peak.\nSo I'll expect another month of growth of ~5 pts/month for July, followed by a bit less growth in August and a little less in September and October, but I'll allow for the possibility that growth will continue at existing levels for July through October. Looking at 2020, I don't think avg growth >5 pts/month is out of the question, but I don't think 2021 will be like 2020 because the median home sale price was exploding in Q3 2020 but is starting to plateau now.\nPossible outcomes are constrained by time at this point.

The 14.6% gain in the National Composite is literally the highest reading in more than 30 years of S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data,\u201d said Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. > Not only did home prices rise in all 20 cities, but the price gains accelerated in all as well and were in the top quartile of performance historically. > \u201cWe have previously suggested that the strength in the U.S. housing market is being driven in part by reaction to the COVID pandemic, as potential buyers move from urban apartments to suburban homes. April\u2019s data continue to be consistent with this hypothesis,\u201d added Lazzara.\n\n> Home sales have been falling for the past few months, due both to low supply, especially at the entry level of the market, and very high prices. Single-family housing starts have also slipped, as homebuilders try to keep up with a heavy backlog of demand amid high prices for land, labor and materials. > There has been growing talk of a price bubble in the housing market, but the fundamentals of today\u2019s market say otherwise. > \u201cAlthough home price growth is reaching new highs, the risk of price declines has fallen far below pre-pandemic and summer 2006 levels, when homes prices last peaked. This is likely because favorable mortgage rates and income growth continue to keep the ratio of mortgage payments to monthly household income much lower today,\u201d said Selma Hepp, deputy chief economist at CoreLogic.

Home prices really jumped up, and I've heard much of the reason for that is that the supply of houses on the market cratered. Checking out some data on that [1] it looks like that's exactly right. Housing supply cratered in late spring/early summer 2020. That coincides with the beginning of the above-trend increase in housing prices according to the Case-Shiller metric [2]. As shown in [1], as of May the housing supply is back into the territory from before the pandemic. So I think it's likely that prices level off or return to trend soon. High prices incentivize home-owners to get their houses on the market and they also disincentivize buyers from buying at outrageous prices, and both these factors will put downward pressure on home prices.  It's also worth noting there's a seasonal effect to prices. As shown in [2], price growth peaks in the spring or early summer and drops back in the fall. Looking at the index history [3], since 2012 the change from April to October is 3% to 3.5%, with a minimum of 2.07% and a max of 5.8% in the history. If the same held this year that would result in the following: Average/Median: 256.5 to 257.8\nMax: 263.5\nMin: 254.2 Overall I think there's a higher chance of a return to trend or even a leveling off or dropping in price.

Because the median home sales price fell in Q1, I'm going to bet on a slightly lower value of the S&P/Case-Shiller Index than if it continued to increase as steeply as it has since the pandemic started and especially in early 2021. I'll project an average of a 3-point raise over the next 6 months through October 2021, to 267, with wide error bars."], [14266, "2021-07-09T22:48:54Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [100836, "2021-07-09T20:45:04Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.4, 0.05], "April 2021 is 249, and the price growth rate has accelerated for each of the past 4 months.
