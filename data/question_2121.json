Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said the rush of paid GOP events at Trump\u2019s club is \u201cindicative of how powerful of a hold he has on the party.\u201d Zelizer noted that while other former presidents have given paid speeches or taken seats on lucrative boards, they did not rent property to candidates while serving as GOP kingmaker and contemplating another White House run. \u201cIt\u2018s like a party boss, with one of his homes being the place for wheeling and dealing and picking the next Senate candidate,\u201d Zelizer said.

A coterie of political advisers, including two experts on Iowa, have been added to the payroll.\n. . . \n. . . he has spent little [money] to try to prove the election was tainted. \u201cThey aren\u2019t paying for audits - they want others to pay for it,\u201d said one Republican official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. \u201cHe is just raising money to have a big slush fund.\u201d\n. . . \n. .  .the volume of fundraising pitches, which often hit supporters by email and text multiple times a day, has sometimes annoyed Trump, who has heard complaints from friends, according to an adviser. But he also likes the result: more money to show other Republicans he remains the most formidable presidential candidate, advisers said. Trump\u2019s three main committees are not authorized to spend on behalf of a campaign for him, which would operate under different fundraising and spending limitations. Those committees are Save America PAC; a fundraising effort that handles much of the outreach, called Save America Joint Fundraising Committee; and a smaller group that was created out of the remains of Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, called the Make America Great Again PAC. The latter is focused primarily on winding down spending for the last campaign, advisers said. . . .  if he declares himself a candidate, his current accounts will immediately be barred under campaign law from any expenditures on his behalf in excess of $5,000.\n. . . \n\u201cThe only real limitation right now is he can\u2019t use it for personal advocacy to get elected. And that\u2019s pretty vague,\u201d said one political adviser. If Trump has money left over through his noncandidate fundraising accountswhen he does declare,advisers say, the plan is to transfer the money to another, independent political group, which would be able to spend unlimited amounts to support Trump, though the former president and his direct campaign advisers would be barred from coordinating the spending. In the meantime, Save America has given Trump a way to advertise on both Google and Facebook, despite the bans on his posting on social media platforms controlled by the two companies. . . .  The Facebook ban, put in place after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, will last at least two years, the company says. But it is limited in scope. \u201cPresident Trump is suspended from Facebook so he can\u2019t post at all,\u201d Devon Kearns, a Facebook spokeswoman, explained in a statement. \u201cGroups affiliated with the former president are not barred from posting on Facebook so long as they are not posting in his voice.\u201d That means the social network has removed ads that appear to quote Trump, even when the quotes appear on a landing page linked to the ad. . . . \n. . . \nA group of liberal advocacy organizations led by Common Cause has asked Facebook to revisit its policy of allowing Save America to advertise as long as it doesn\u2019t use Trump\u2019s voice, since it was established by Trump days after the 2020 election. Facebook has not yet made clear whether Trump will be able to operate a campaign under the same rules, possibly permitting him to advertise his 2024 effort on the site. \u201cThe response we got was we have no answer for you at the moment,\u201d said Yosef Getachew, the director of Media and Democracy Program at Common Cause, of his conversations with the company. Facebook\u2019s spokeswoman did not comment on the company\u2019s discussions with Common Cause. Google has banned Trump\u2019s YouTube page for an indefinite period of time, but it has allowed Save America to buy image and text advertising on its platform, with the overwhelming majority of the $17,500 in spending taking place since Oct. 9.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS:\nMAGA Again just held its first event:  a golf tournament.  I have no idea how much it netted.  With 2 months to go before this question closes, might there be 2 more fund-raising events before this question closes?  If each event nets $2m (a generous estimate, I think), we're talking about a $6m increase 6/30-12/31. I have read lots of articles about how DJT's Save America PAC has registered its 1 millionth donor recently, but I don't know how many were registered as of 6/30 in its predecessor PAC.  I wonder, too, what the mean average donation is and what % of the funds on hand as of 6/30 was from direct donations and what % came from event revenue.  https://washingtonnewsday.com/us-politics/the-save-america-campaign-of-donald-trump-claims-to-have-surpassed-1-million-online-donors/ The Trump campaign is now giving out  t-shirts when a person makes a donation of $45 or more.  (I am assuming that $45 is more than the average donation by at least as much as the t-shirts cost. . . . might the average be $30?  with 1m donors, that's $30m.)

Those PAC's are now lower in cash. Individual contributions are a small percentage.  I suspect contributions will pick up steam starting next year for the 2022 election season, with some cash outlayed this year for for the Cali recall election and 2020 election audits.
