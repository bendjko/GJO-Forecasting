Amazon to end an EU antitrust investigation over contracts with e-book publishers.  Amazon has proposed to drop some clauses in its contracts that required publishers to inform about terms offered to the company\u2019s competitors and to give to Amazon equal or better terms. . . .  this not the first time EU regulators seek compromises with business giants. The European Commission opened a formal antitrust investigation against Amazon in June 2015. The concern was that, thanks to such \u201cparity clauses\u201d, Amazon may have abused its dominant position on the markets for the retail distribution of English and German language e-books to consumers.  The clauses covered not only price but many aspects that a competitor can use to differentiate itself from Amazon, such as an alternative business (distribution) model, an innovative e-book or a promotion. Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 54 of the EEA Agreement prohibit the abuse of a \u201cdominant position which may affect trade and prevent or restrict competition\u201d.\n. . . \nAmazon is not the only one tech company to have come under the lens of European regulators in the last few years. Microsoft, Facebook, Intel and, more remarkably, Google all have faced \u2013 or are facing \u2013 accusations of anti-competitive practices in the 28-country bloc. Also, this is not the first case where the EU\u2019s executive arm accepts or at least takes into consideration an offer by the accused party to settle an antitrust case. Last November, the EU-Gazprom case became prominent after the state-controlled Russian energy group announced it will work on a compromise with EU regulators to finalise a deal to end a five-year antitrust case. It seems that now seeking an agreement with the accused party is becoming a sort of more favourable option not just for the company itself but also for the Commission. Indeed if it is true that no fine could be imposed on a company after the agreement, it is also true that a settlement represents a way to end very complex antitrust cases that otherwise could drag on for years, with a potential negative impact on future investments. Article 9 of the EU\u2019s Antitrust Regulation (Regulation 1/2003) allows the Commission to conclude antitrust proceedings by accepting commitments offered by a company. Such a decision does not reach a conclusion on whether EU antitrust rules have been infringed but legally binds the company to respect the commitments.\n"], [691, "2017-05-10T14:19:30Z", [0.62], ""], [691, "2017-05-09T16:32:23Z", [0.61], ""], [1052, "2017-05-09T15:10:43Z", [0.8], ""], [4634, "2017-05-09T14:05:11Z", [0.7], ""], [34879, "2017-05-09T09:18:08Z", [0.55], ""], [4139, "2017-05-08T23:46:16Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-05-08T11:23:02Z", [0.61], ""], [35311, "2017-05-08T05:02:55Z", [0.9], ""], [34404, "2017-05-08T00:29:12Z", [0.71], ""], [29680, "2017-05-07T22:30:04Z", [0.3], "The cases under review seem fairly benign.

The case against the presentation of ads in Google search is more credible, and the fact that some differing cases have been merged under this one case would suggest the Commission is putting a fair bit of resources into the investigation. The time it has taken in the past for resolution of IT antitrust cases in the EU has ranged from 1-4 years for companies such as Microsoft (on several occasions) and Intel. The proceedings in the latter Google case were opened in July 2016, hence the earliest we could expect a decision is in Autumn 2017. Given that these cases concern new technology and business models there will  not be many precedents to draw from making the process longer. In addition, Google has sufficient resources to mount a serious legal challenge to the investigation so can draw out the process further.

These types of fines are adjusted so as to maximize the collection without destroying the company.  Such as the US fine to the German bank and as will probably end of being the case with Volkswagen.
