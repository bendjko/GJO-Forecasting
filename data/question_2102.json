Likewise, there is no obligation on govt to hold an election before then. It seems that chancellors primarily change as a result of a change of PM (with few resigning and less being sacked). Therefore the outside view is that the chances are low (around 10%).  In terms of the inside view, there are a number of factors that could impact this : being ousted by BJ (allegedly jealous of Rishi's popularity); pushing a leadership challenge; resigning due to his job being very hard (it feels he has presided over a difficult period); and coming up to a winter that is set to be extremely challenging (Brexit driver issues; fuel price crisis etc.). All of these would encourage the % to increase from 20%. However, per the above, the occurrence of such circumstances is unusual. Worth adding that he is also relatively young and supposedly very clean living, so a health scare feels very unlikely. Therefore, it feels the most likely way that Rishi would cease to be chancellor is a challenge to BJ's leadership within the Tories, or his own resignation, with a result to such being declared prior to 1 January 2022.

The announcement of the NI tax increase and the furore within the right wing / Tory supporting press may be an indicator of some shadow manoeuvring taking place between Johnson and Sunak's offices in the wake of Johnson's hard fall from grace in recent months [1].  Worthy of a proper analytical and review at this point therefore. ----------------- Ways in which this could happen:\n1.  Sunak resigns.\n2.  Sunak is fired or relegated to another cabinet role.\n3.  Sunak is promoted (i.e. becomes PM).\n4.  Sunak dies. 1.  Resignations are a thing of the past for this government and seem to only happen when Rupert Murdock wants you gone.  They certainly don't happen because you've done something shameful, egregious or disreputable: such things are not induced resignation worthy offences in the land of the Clown Prince we now occupy.  No obvious reasons why Sunak would resign at this moment voluntarily except perhaps to proactively avoid any of the poop coming down the pipe in the near future that he fears would soil his image when he makes his own leadership bid (see below).  No signs of groundwork being laid in the Murdock or Tory friendly press who seem happy to allow Sunak to hide beneath the \"public consciousness\" water line and let the Clown Prince take the blame for less popular policy moves. 2.  For Johnson to sack or move Sunak out of the No.2 position at this moment would be a highly controversial move and one likely to face significant internal backlash.  It would seem to signal to the world Johnson's belief that Sunak is manoeuvring to pull a Brutus on him (and that Boris considered that a serious threat to his position) and move any showdown war between them into the open.  Whilst such concern in Johnson's camp seems warranted and reasonable,  Johnson will probably be calculating that if he were to move any conflict with his chancellor into the open its a conflict he'd probably loose on his current popularity vector [1].  As such it seems more likely Johnson will be playing the \"keep your enemies close\" game and, for the moment, that Sunak will be happy to play along whilst Johnson is present to see more UK, COVID and Brexit disasters lain in his ample lap.  No current indications that Sunak's head is on Boris' reshuffle block [2] although any internal revolt over the recently announced NI Tax hike may spill over into the chancellors office and is therefore worth watching for [3]. 3.  For this to occur Johnson would have to resign, die or be deposed in a leadership conflict.  October's party conference will be indicative for this course of action but Johnson's current performance and popularity [1] and the upcoming travails he faces with counter manifesto tax rises, back bench revolts, COVID and Flu season strains on the NHS, more corruption revelations, broken Brexit promises etc. etc. certainly leave the door open for a Brutus moment to emerge if his presentation at the Party conference goes badly [4] and he's not able to stabilise his populist derived popularity in short order. BUT:  is this the right time for the Tory Party to offer up Boris' ample back side on the sacrificial altar of public furore?  Probably not. \nNot quite: not when there are plenty of other Brexit, health care and economic disasters and embarrassments queuing up for the UK and its government in the next 6 - 9 months that the cynical Tory Party honchos will want to be able to blame on Boris and therefore conveniently shed when they kick him to the curb just in time to regain for the next election.  To do so now would seem early and, from the replacement's perspective, why would they want to take on these irresolvable crises and spoil their own chances at keeping the big job at the next election? The only reason to turf Boris at this less than advantageous moment is if the political calculus suggests that Boris' toxicity has become so severe that it will affect local and \"non-election season\" voting [5] and/or if they believe his continued presence could do sufficient lasting damage to undermine their prospects at the next election no matter who takes over.  Such difficult political calculations mirror what the US Republican Party seems to be wrestling with at this time: a quiet / unspoken and internal wish to shed the disastrous populist \"leader\" of yester-year (and some of their more financially and economically harmful policies) but no politically easy or obvious means of doing so without handing the other side an unrecoverable win. There are some indications that this moment may be nearing  [6] with increasingly significant elements of the historically Tory friendly political infrastructure turning on their long time power conduit as their bottom lines start being eaten into by the hardening policies of the UK's \"Trump lite\" [7].  But to remove Johnson now and for this reasoning would also require some major policy reversal and a shedding of some of the more hard line Brexit policies in order to recover the UK's economic prospects and get money back into Tory donor's off shore bank accounts.  To do so risks reinvigorating the internal Tory party divisions that scared Cameron so and started the UK down this toilet flush vortex it now finds itself in. Such existential tensions seem to be most likely to bubble over as we near the next election and when the impacts of this incompetent BoJo Brexit are being felt more keenly and by more people (thereby offering the Tory Party the off ramp of a 180 degree flip against the ERG, the current government trajectory and the now evidently calamitous policies that will have lost popular support). In such an environment, Sunak will want to be ready to step to the fore as \"the man for the moment\", hoping at the same time that he'll be largely untainted by the policies of \"the last lot\" (despite his back room involvement in everything they did).  This would explain why Sunak (and Javid as much as he can) have routinely shrank into the shadows whilst the more front line and media hungry members of BoJo's clown car (the Clown Prince himself, Priti Patel, Raab and, until recently, Hancock) take all the heat. Again, is this the right time?  It doesn't feel like it politically, but some probability must be added for those events and players that are outside the Tory Party's control and may force them to stick the knife in early and before they might otherwise have chosen to. 4.  Sunak is young (41 - very young for a chancellor when compared to his historical peers with only Osbourne beating his \"baby face\" credentials when he took office at 39!).  Sunak is also apparently of good health and the base rate for death of chancellors in office is vanishingly low [8] with the last being Iain Macleod in 1970 who died of a heart attack after a \"heavy life\" at the age of 57 [9]. --------------- With all the above hopefully being relevant, accurate and applicable to this question I'd call Boris' displacement (and Sunak's potential elevation or compelled shift out of his current seat) as potential but at this time not politically advantageous to any side.  With the hard control these players have over their political fates at this moment, and without the external driver of a massive upcoming disaster that is likely to force a change within this question's timeframe, I think a slightly higher than 1 in 10 chance (accounting for Q4 2021's uncertainties, ongoing economic travails and the Tory party conference in October) feels about right.

Of those, only three would have less tenure than Rishi Sunak if he left before 1 January 2022: Sajid Javid, John Major, and Iain Macleod.  John Major went on to be PM and Mr. Macleod passed away in office.  This would mean an unconditional base rate of ~17%. Now let's apply scenarios to generate a conditional base rate:\n1. Boris Johnson's Health:   I have found no information that would imply that Boris Johnson has an elevated risk of a pre-mature death.  \n2. Snap Election:  The next scheduled election is on or before 2 May 2024 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_United_Kingdom_general_election].  Also, it is hard to call a snap election due to the Fixed-term Parliament Act of 2011.  It is worth recognizing that Conservative party has trying to repeal the FTPA, though it has not advanced yet [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_and_Calling_of_Parliament_Bill].  Finally, Boris Johnson is less likely to call for one, especially as the Chancellor has higher approval ratings in his own party.  As a result, he would be likely to lose the leadership position. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservatives-back-rishi-sunak-as-boris-johnsons-popularity-slides-2jlzxtcvl Assuming no snap election and both Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson's health is not an issue, the conditional base rate would now be 1/17 or 5.8%. On the other hand:\n1. If a scandal erupts involving Rishi Sunak, as Boris Johnson is a politician at his core, he would likely try to capitalize quickly.  Rishi Sunak's background involves finance and asset management [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak].  Any scandals involving money would be a huge problem for the Chancellor, especially given the veracity of the UK tabloids.     \n2.

Johnsons low popularity could be caused by the recent trouble in Afghanistan which means it should rebound as soon as it disappears from the front pages. Still, Sunak is favorite to succeed Johnson so Johnson popularity is a thing to watch. Another possibility is Sunak quitting. As said, he is very popular right now, possibly because he was responsible for a lot of Covid stimulus which is being wound down. Balancing the books will become more important the coming months which will include unpopular measures. Better to quite and let Johnson take the blame for them.
