A Google search, a Quora answer, and a look at the list of missions [2] seem to indicate that time of year is not a concern for Earth orbit launches, i.e. a Jan-Feb launch is no more or less likely than at any other time.

First impression(based on a link below, Wiki and GJO links)\nNov. 2016 launch? - As of now, no destination, and no passenger.  Falcon Heavy has already been delayed from 2013 to a possible summer 2016 launch to the current Nov. 2016 target, due to the Falcon9 launch failure last year (the Falcon Heavy straps 3 of these togather). As a result work on the Falcon Heavy was delayed.  Via Sat, a customer, has switched to The EU's Ariene 5 for a 14,000 lb lift, due to the delays. Potential timeline for FH test flight, with no specific dates - from the link below:\n- work has started on 1 of the 3 boosters. Must complete all 3.\n- move to McGregor, TX for qualifying testing.\n- move all three to Florida for hold down testing, To evaluate how well the three boosters work in unison. Heavy Falcon is usable for numerous missions, (commercial, military, and Mars capability are listed by Spacex as objectives) but also needs to determine which potential markets and revenues will be profitable.  LEO may not be one of these.  The benefit of the FH is the heavy lift capacity, but it seems the only LEO applications may be a massive spy satellite or a module for a space station, neither of which seems likely for an unproven launch vehicle on short notice. Other LEO  options are generally smaller commercial payloads, but that does not seem like a good fit to demonstrate the capabilities of this new technology.  Another option, but not likely of any commercial value, could be a heavy test payload (a box of rocks) simply to prove the lift capability.  To prove the technical capabilities of the FH, it would seem that the Heavy GTO lift, or, more spectacularly a launch of a capsul around the moon may be a better proof of capability.\nhttp://www.universetoday.com/128815/spacex-maiden-falcon-heavy-launch-may-carry-satellite-in-november/\n27 engine technology base rate:\nRussian N1 - last rocket to attempt to fly with so many simultaneous firing engines. Result: 4 launches, 4 failures.\n...https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/05/03/spacex-undecided-on-payload-for-first-falcon-heavy-flight/ Notes:\nLEO: low earth orbit: 99 (88min. Orbit) miles to 1,200 (127 min orbit) miles above sea level. Any orbit lower than this rapidly decays and results in altitude loss.  LEO is the cheapest and simplest orbit for satellite placement. Used for earth observation satellites and spy satellites since being closer to the earth, the visibility is better.  Communication satellites also are placed here, since it is less costly to place them at lower altitudes and less powerful amplifiers are needed for communications, although entire \"constellations\" of these are required to cover the earth's surface. Other orbit types (two types of Geosynchronus orbit):\n- Geostationary (GEO) orbit.  22,236 miles above sea level.  Orbit time is identical to the earth's rotation, so the satellite always appears in the same place in the sky.  Powerful communications, weather satellites and satellites to spy on the cheaper lower orbit communication satellites are here.\n- Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).  Highly elliptical orbit with an apogee at 22,236 miles above sea level (same as GEO). Falcon Heavy Capability: \n - LEO: originally 29,000 lbs (with reusable first stages - unfortunately they need to reserve fuel for the return trip). Upgraded to 50,000+ lbs (for competitive reasons, this figure uses all of the fuel to lift the payload, resulting in the loss of the first stages).\n- GTO: This orbit reportedly has the most revenue potential.  Falcon Heavy reportedly can lift 48,940 lbs (better than the competition) with expendable first stage rockets but only 17,637 lbs (less than the competition), if the engines are to be recovered."], [22539, "2016-06-19T21:51:51Z", [0.5], ""], [25755, "2016-06-19T20:59:49Z", [0.75], ""], [18318, "2016-06-19T20:55:28Z", [0.35], ""], [25698, "2016-06-19T20:37:47Z", [0.85], ""], [14308, "2016-06-19T20:16:32Z", [0.8], "November window gives them plenty of time.

Although it has been often delayed, the Falcon Heavy rocket being developed by SpaceX is likely to fly later this year or early next. Like the Delta IV, the heavy Falcon rocket has three booster cores. However, instead of being powered by a single RS-68 engine, each of the Falcon cores is powered by nine Merlin engines, making for a total of 27 engines firing at liftoff. That makes for a complicated rocket, but if SpaceX can pull it off, it will offer customers the capability to deliver up to 54 tons to low-Earth orbit at a cost of $90 million. Therefore, while the Delta IV comes in at $14 million per ton to orbit, SpaceX might offer customers a similar heavy lift service at $1.7 million per ton.\""]]}
