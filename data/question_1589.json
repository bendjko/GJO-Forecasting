(Interestingly, the 4/4/2020 mentioned in the question is off by about 4k from the Covid tracking project number listed on the website. Are they using a different number than I am?)    Anyway, in the last five days the daily increase in cases ranged from 6.65% to 7.90%.   The daily percentage increase has been on a downward trend.  I want to use a 90 % confidence interval, and there are two days left.  So I will use: low: 491,156 x 1.05^2(squared) = 541,499.   high: 491,156 * 1.1^2= 594,298.  The mid-point is 567,898.  More than six days ago the changes were all in the double digits.  There is a slight risk those higher percentages could return, but after five days I think it is only a slight change. Post-prediction note:  I think I may have misread the question.  The question says: the outcome will be determined using data from The COVID Tracking Project for Sunday 12 April 2020 as of 4:00PM ET on Monday 13 April under \"Positive\".   Is there a delay in processing the data collected prior to 4 p.m. that will change the number published on Sunday at 4 p.m.?  If so, how much?  There is no information relating a delay in processing.  There is a note on the Covid website that said some data arrives after 4 p.m., which is included in the next day's totals.  Yet, this seems irrelevant since the cut-off is 4 p.m. on Sunday.   The confusing part is the mention of 4 p.m. on Monday.  Why mention it if we are not going to use Monday's numbers?  Why 4 p.m.?  I realize that the GJP employees probably take weekends off like the rest of the world.  If the question was going to resolved on Monday when the webmaster comes into work, why mention 4 p.m.?   -- unless we are using Monday's published numbers and not Sundays.  Just curious, is anyone else confused by this?  or just me? If there is another day, Monday, to be included and my numbers change substantially.   The 5 percent low number now becomes 568,574 and the high number becomes 653,728.  So, the new mid-point is 611,151.  I also would have computed new numbers using 8 and 8.5 percent since I only used 10 because it the highest possible number and still yielded a midpoint well within the third range.  The new  high number after 3 days using 8% and 8.5% are 622,494 and 627,348, respectively. the new mid-points would be in the range of 597,594. or a bit less.  I also would have tried other 80 percent and 70 percent ranges to see if I could narrow the likely high and low numbers further.  \nAt 7.5 percent, the average is 610,611.   At 7.43 percent, which is the mean of the percentages, I get 566,853 after 2 days, and 608,970 after 3 days using just 491,156 to compute the projected number.

In these scenarios, the results on 12 April would be as follows:  (i) after a 7% cumulative increase: ~ 554k\n(ii) after a 9% cumulative increase: ~ 597k There is a chance that the number of positive cases could exceed 600k, but that would require a significant uptick from now until 12 April, which seems inconsistent with the current trend.

Since 1 April, the daily percentage change in positive cases has increased between the parameters of 14% (on the high end) and roughly 8% (on the low end). Therefore, these parameters are my expected values for the next few days. The data does not support any radical deviation from these parameters, so this is the basis for my calculations. We begin with 423,222 positive cases as of 8 April. We expect a value in the range of an 8-14% increase from this value. So, on the low end, we expect the 9 April report to be roughly 457k, and on the high end, approximately 482k. In the last few days (starting around 5 April) we have seen the percentages fall into the single-digit range, so we would expect that trend to continue, although I have accounted for a sudden uptick in my calculations. Realistically, whatever that actual percentage change is, it should only be within the 8-14% range - not significantly lower or higher. With those parameters set, it is only a matter of simple calculation, which I will not go through here. Suffice it to say, even a low-end estimate puts the number of positive cases above 600k, and a high-end estimate puts the number below 700k.  I did allow for the number of positive cases to be in the 500-600k range, because it is possible that the percentage change could keep declining. It is much more unlikely that this change will spike upwards.

It has been difficult to estimate the slowing down of the covid-19 outbreaks in different countries especially when the deaths and infected cases are still experiencing exponential growth with short doubling times. From the few examples, slowing down of the outbreaks appeared 2 to 3 weeks after effective lockdowns have been applied.  Recently Google published Google Mobility Reports [1] based on analysis of the location data of cell phones worldwide. It compared movements for several activities against a baseline before the outbreak. This allows us to identify the timeline of the lockdown. Modeling Scheme:\n1.\tUse relative Workplaces mobility trend line to identify the start of an effective lockdown (T0)\n2.\tAssume turning point T1 = T0 + 3 weeks. \n3.\tExtrapolate cases to T1 using the current doubling time reported by Our World Data [2].\n4.\tApply a logistic model by fitting to the existing data and modeled data at the turning point T1.\n5.\tExtrapolate the model to the closing date in question.\n6.\tThis model will be modified from time to time as the date gets closer to T1 to see if the above parameters and assumption have been violated. For the US, the turning point is 16 April.  The current doubling time for infected cases is 7 days. Model prediction for total deaths on 12 April is 610k.  Note that 12 April is earlier than the turning point of 16 April.  The forecast total cases are just from using the doubling time. If doubling time of 6, 8 and 9 days are used, the total cases are 675k, 568k and 536k, respectively.  Since it appears that the US outbreaks are slowing down, it is more likely to have doubling times of 8-9 days versus 6.

Looking each state as if it is a hot spot (which is the best I can do with the data at hand) there are no hotspots that appear to be at the stage of the spread where the daily increase in infections rate is as high as has been typical at the take point in other places. In hotspots outside the US daily rate of increases in infections have been 40% to 50% which have declined to around 25% a day until lockdowns (stay-at-home) policies have been put in place, After a fairly steady 25% daily increase before a lockdown, about two to three weeks after the lockdown (i.e. when the lockdown has had time to work) the daily percentage increase starts to drop, but (because the total number of case is still getting bigger) the number of daily new cases continues to rise by a similar number each day for around another week or ten days, during this stage the typical daily percentage increase drops from 25% to 10%. After that stage (as the full effect of the lockdown comes into effect with R now being below 1) the daily percentage continues to drop, (but hovers around the 10% for several days) and then actual number of new cases per day starts to drop.  Outside the US this pattern was seen. China was well ahead of most countries, and Wuhan was ahead of the rest of China. So when Wuham had reduced its daily rate of increase to 10% other parts of China had higher daily percentage rates, and then Wuhan got down to almost zero while other parts of China still had higher daily rates, until the whole of China had very small increases daily (with a total of about 80,000 cases) but most of the rest of the world had few cases (5,000 or so so) but a very high daily increase percentage, this  5,000 expended to over a million in March, while the total in China remained fairly static.  Unless the data is wrong (or I have misunderstood it) in the USA the over 25% a day increases have passed in all States. The places with the highest daily percentage increases are smaller places and I don't see them making a significant difference to over all total.

I then average the last three days of April 12th projections to establish a my official mean count. I do this to average out the volatility of growth rates from one day to the next. Because I'm only taking an average of the last three days instead of the past seven days, the model may undercount when using data from Sat/Sun/Mon and overcount when using data from Tue/Wed/Thu due to known weekly variability on those days [3], but hopefully this balances out some of that discrepancy while still using very recent data. To find the probabilities for each bin, I then set a max upward bound of four times the difference of the projected mean and the latest count, a very rough calculation based on eyeballing the prediction intervals of Fotios Petropoulos' projections from early March [4]. For example, today's projection shows a mean of 663,793 U.S. cases by April 12th. After subtracting today's count (332,308) and multiplying by 4, the upper bound then is 1,989,734 cases. Upper bound should be ~3 standard deviations, so I calculate the standard deviation by dividing the difference between the upper bound and the mean by 3 for a final standard deviation of 441,980. (Because I'm taking the difference between projected mean and today's count, this standard deviation will naturally narrow as we get closer to April 12th, honing in on a particular bin.) I then calculate probabilities for bins based on that standard deviation and a lower bound standard deviation that creates a non-normalized distribution, given the exponential probabilities in the upper bound. When calculating probabilities against the bin ranges defined in this forecasting question, I get the following: Less than 500,000: 7%\nto 600,000: 21%\nto 700,000: 25%\nto 800,000: 9%\nto 900,000: 8%\nto 1,000,000: 7%\nto 1,100,000: 6%\nto 1,200,000: 5%\nOver 1,200,000: 11% To get my final forecast, I \"extremize\" by 20% to account for likely conservativeness in model:\n7%, 20%, 28%, 8%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 11% I'll update my model and forecast daily.
