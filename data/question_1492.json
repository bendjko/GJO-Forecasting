First, while North Korea has declared it has no COIVD infections, this claim is almost virtually guaranteed to be false; given the country\u2019s underdeveloped medical infrastructure and proximity to China the nation likely has been hit very hard by the disease, accordingly, Trump is very unlikely to travel near a COVID hotspot. (2) Second, North Korea has not launched a missile since 2017, (3) while the DRPK remains an omnipresent foreign policy challenge for the United States, given the nation\u2019s recent good behavior and the current American fixation on domestic politics (RE COVID and race relations) barring renewed agitation by the North Koreans Trump has little incentive to engage Un further in the near future.

The wording  of the question could be clearer.) Factors considered:\n- historical precedent;\n- possible new triggers;\n- potential obstacles to a meeting. HISTORICAL PRECEDENT\nNorth Korea (NK) has a dependence on foreign aid, and using belligerence to gain more of that aid (citation needed). This belligerence has only once resulted in a meeting between the US President and the Supreme Leader, following the 2017-18 North Korea Crisis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_Singapore_Summit#Background). A number of factors created these conditions so calculating the likelihood of a similar \"fever pitch\" will obviously be difficult. For simplicity's sake, let's say that the necessary precipitating conditions are regular increased long-range nuclear payload delivery testing and increased sanctions on NK by the US. \n- As of the date of writing, NK has conducted a test of 2 unidentified projectiles on 2 March 2020, with the next most recent test being short range projectiles on 28 November 2019. There has been no 'streak' of long range ballistic missile tests since 2017. Very roughly, this puts the per year rate of NK increased long-range nuclear payload delivery testing at 1/3 or 0.333 (sampling only the Trump presidency).\n- The US has increased sanctions on North Korea multiple times during the Trump presidency, though all during 2017. As some of these were arguably in response to NK belligerence, we will increase the likelihood slightly to account for the potential of low level NK belligerence prompting a further increase. 0.400\n- I am not accounting for the feedback loop of one of these conditions increasing the likelihood of the other, as I don't know how to do that. The likelihood of both occurring, and thus the historical likelihood of conditions precipitating the to leaders meeting is therefore 0.333 * 0.400 = 0.133 POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE PRECIPITATION\nCOVID-19 stresses could drive NK to seek additional aid by diplomatic or other means. I will assume more provocative means are preferred due to that being NK's MO and producing results faster. I would say 0.430 given the already precipitous relationship NK has with stability.  LIKELY OBSTACLES\nI do not see any likely obstacles, particularly not COVID-19 social distancing norms. NK's leadership will not want to be seen as fearing the virus, and the US President will want to encourage the opening of America and return to normality. There is a possibility that the conditions in the US would require the president's attention to the extent he has to neglect foreign affairs, but I would peg that as 0.01 or smaller. Let's say 0.01 to account for uncertainty. RESULT\nOur model is therefore:  ( likelihood of precipitation conditions + likelihood of alternative triggers ) - probability of potential obstacles  thus ( 0.133 + 0.430 ) - 0.01 = 0.553 55% Chance"], [7221, "2020-04-19T22:52:36Z", [0.1], ""], [57778, "2020-04-19T22:45:16Z", [0.02], ""], [87732, "2020-04-19T22:41:51Z", [0.25], "In person meeting seems unlikely but it is not beyond Trump to insist on it as part of driven to reopen the economy, and to score a foreign policy win before election"], [87271, "2020-04-19T19:18:02Z", [0.03], ""], [16727, "2020-04-19T17:58:49Z", [0.2], ""], [86591, "2020-04-19T15:33:44Z", [0.08], ""], [25755, "2020-04-19T15:21:58Z", [0.1], ""], [87420, "2020-04-19T15:02:26Z", [0.05], ""], [66692, "2020-04-19T14:35:24Z", [0.0], ""], [11447, "2020-04-19T14:29:38Z", [0.3], "Trump's track record would seem to suggest this is pretty likely (2 out of his 3 years in office so far, so 66%).

After the election, Trump won't do anything but play golf if he loses, as he has little inherent interest in governing.

However, multiple incidents have occurred since that first meeting that has not allowed a second summit to occur. Specifically, on 10 Feb 2020, President Donald J Trump reportedly told advisors that he did not want a second summit before the November elections [1]. Additionally, the US government is planning for the COVID-19 pandemic to last up to 18 months [2] and the US and on 19 March 2020 the US State Department issued a level 4 travel advisory, which advises all Americans not to travel abroad [3]. Further, China is north Korea's largest supporter and trade partner [4]. north Korea has claimed that not a single resident has been infected by COVID-19, however, there are multiple signs that the country is suffering from a massive outbreak [5]. Additionally, China has asked the US to resume negotiations with north Korea and lessen sanctions in order to assist north Korea with combating COVID-19 infections [6]. However, President Donald J. Trump continues to call the COVID-19 pandemic the \"Chinese Virus\"[7] and will most likely avoid doing anything that could provide positive press to China. Additionally, if the COVID-19 outbreak continues into the fall, north Korea might refuse to meet with the US delegation in order to avoid publicizing any impact the pandemic has had on their country. Finally, President Donald J Trump will most likely want to focus on domestic issues leading up to the November election, especially since the stock market has fallen back to the same levels it was at when he was elected to office [8]. If he focused his efforts and planning on meeting with a foreign leader, especially one that is a dictator and adversary of the US, instead of focusing on ways to help the US recover, it would likely poll poorly amongst swing voters. If he wins the Presidential election in November, he will be more focused on core issues that are more important to his base than north Korea (i.e. illegal immigration, stock market gains, helping the US economy recover from the effects of COVID-19). Thus, I assess a 0% possibility that President Donald J. Trump will meet with kim jong un before 1 January 2020.
