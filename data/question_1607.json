Additionally, thus far North Korea\u2019s Supreme Leaders have only left office in their death. The 1st Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, held the position until July 8th, 1994. On that date, Kim Jong-il took office and held the position until his death on December 17th, 2011. Kim Jong-un took office on that date.

Recent speculations about Kim Jong Un's health, leading to questions of a new head of state seem to be exaggerated. Statements by a South Korean news source that Kim Jong Un had undergone heart surgery in April were provided by a single unnamed source, and recent events suggest that he still has the capacity to act as the head of North Korea. On 24 September, Kim Jong Un gave a statement apologizing for the killing of a South Korean national by North Korean border guards, implying that he is still able to function as the leader of the North Korean state. It is possible that Kim Jong Un's health could rapidly collapse in the coming days, and according to Philip Tetlock's Superforecasting, over-reacting to evidence can lead to inaccurate predictions, so I believe a prediction less than 10% would be ignoring the possibility of rapid health deterioration.

Firstly, is that his heart surgery has been successful and he repeatedly continued to attend public events since. Secondly, the comeuppance of his sister does not necessarily prove that she is being primed to take over for two key reasons. In Confucian Korea, it is meant to be a man who leads due to the family structure of Korea, this has been the case since Kim Il-Sung. Also, her comeuppance may be linked to Kim needing people he can really trust, he has executed around 300 important people in recent years, and her appearance at the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea, where she \"stole the show\" according to South Korean media shows she can be an external propaganda asset to the Kim regime.  Thirdly, it is unlikely that the regime would see a quick change of leader due to Kim Jong-un's health. If we look back, Kim Jong-Il defacto led the country for many years before the death of his father in 1994, it is likely that this North Korea would follow a similar cautious path because they prioritise regime survival above all else.

Being educated by two generations who lead this regime with stability until now indicate that he would have that competency in his bones. I can only imagine brain damage to seriously leave him unfit to control his power base. The US likelihood of a Traumatic Brain Injury is about 1%.

I imagine he watches S. Korean drama and dreams of another life, but what are his odds of retiring and not being killed?

Current head of state is overpowered by rival. 2%.\nI would not consider it impossible that he could be overthrown by a rival but hard to get a lay of the land and the current candidates. Dictators on average get to rule 13 years (max 47 years, min 1 year), and given Kim Jong-un started his reign in 2011 and his father and grandfather both rules their entire life I would put this likelihood as low but not insignificant.

A quick internet search on when dictators die brought up a couple articles one of which was  (https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/) which was a good read but i did not dive into data yet on how often a dictatorship announces a new head of state.  So for my first forecast I am going to set the current dictator's death to that of the most likely medical cause of death that I think might occur in the next 6 or so months which to me would be c19 related.  So I will set that at a 2% chance of occurrence since the death rate from c19 is somewhere between 1-3% world wide of people who get it.

After reading this and just taking a birds eye view of how tight the leadership of NK is, and the lack of reliable information coming out of NK regarding well anything, I'm going to make a blackbox prediction that this could happen at 1% in the next six or so months. A possible third way one could think of would be a war with external countries that starts and resolves itself in such a way a new leader of NK would be announced, and that would be if there were still a state called NK after such a war.  For me this might be .05 percent likely in the next 6 months at most. So for my first 30 minute dive forecast I will add up my 3 parts and come up with 3.5 percent.

He's just been taking coronavirus precautions (40%) or is lazy and couldn't be bothered to show up to work (15%) (Combined probability 55%)\nC. Something else has caused this kerfuffle (15%) If scenario A: A.1. He's already dead (latest pictures a fake) (30%)\nA.2.

If he's dead, I'll give a 60% chance his sister succeeds him by then, a 25% chance someone else succeeds, and a 15% that they're pretending he's still alive as the country's embroiled in a succession battle.

I won't speculate what could fall into this scenario beyond, maybe, some kind of internal coup.

On top of this, I'll add an extra percentage point to account for, say, he scenario A where he recovers or scenario B, but then something else comes out of complete leftfield to result in a change of regime.

Unrest in North Korea is not a norm and undermines his regime. Even the smallest amount of unrest caused by ambiguity about the ruling elite in North Korea could snowball into general rebellion. It would be in KJU's best interest to come forward as soon as possible if he could, and he hasn't. The tricky thing is how the question is phrased, because \"naming\" a new head of state may take awhile depending if his sister is the one with the most power (a woman, and not as likely to rule as if she were a man). But the politics of it should go quickly if KJU were to die.  About 50% of those in a vegetative state recover within a month from TBI, while other causes may not allow the patient to recover as well. If KJU is in a vegetative state, and it lasts for over a month, then he likely won't recover in any meaningful way (we are at least over about half-way there). Most people die within 6 months.
