Investigators faulted the poor design of the Max and a lack of regulatory oversight from the US Federal Aviation Administration, along with errors by flight crews.\nThe agency plans to make the report public Friday, roughly a year after the 737 Max 8 plane crashed into the Java Sea. All 189 people on board died. Ahead of the report's publication, investigators held a press conference in Jakarta. Lion Air crash investigation faults Boeing 737 Max design and oversight\nLion Air crash investigation faults Boeing 737 Max design and oversight\nA summary of the report blames the crash on faulty \"assumptions\" made during the design and certification of the 737 Max about how pilots would respond to malfunctions by the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). CNN saw a presentation of the summary earlier this week. A press release detailing the report's findings was also released Friday.\nMCAS lowers the nose of the plane when it receives information that the aircraft is flying too slowly or steeply, and at risk of stalling. The system was vulnerable because it relied on a single angle of attack (AOA) sensor, investigators said.\nThe AOA sensor on the doomed Lion Air plane experienced issues on earlier flights and was replaced. But the airline's maintenance crews and pilots couldn't identify the problem because one of the aircraft's safety features \u2014 the AOA Disagree alert \u2014 was not \"correctly enabled during Boeing 737-8 (Max) development,\" they said.\nBoeing has admitted this feature that should have been standard was instead enabled only for airlines that purchased an optional upgrade, and has said that it will fix the problem. \nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/25/business/lion-air-crash-boeing-737-max/index.html The grounding of the 737 Max after two fatal crashes continues to drag on, frustrating airline executives as the carriers miss out on close to $1 billion in revenue this year alone. Southwest Airlines, the largest U.S. operator of the Max, said the grounding cost it $210 million in revenue in the last quarter, $435 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and said it expects the \u201cthe damages to grow into 2020.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not happy about our situation,\u201d CEO Gary Kelly told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d on Thursday. Southwest, which had 34 Max planes in its fleet at the time of the grounding, more than any other U.S. airline, posted stronger profit and revenue in the important third quarter, which includes the summer travel season. But the grounding crimped sales and dashed its capacity growth plans. Southwest expects to receive about 75 Max planes from Boeing next year when the grounding is lifted but the timeline is uncertain. \u201cWe put our future in the hands of Boeing in the Max and we\u2019re grounded,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI want to settle with Boeing to settle our damages.\u201d\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/airline-chiefs-frustrated-as-boeing-737-max-grounding-cost-nears-1-billion.html Alice Springs plane graveyard to house Silk Air's grounded Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-01/boeing-737-max-8-grounded-aircraft-stored-at-alice-springs/11560082"], [59116, "2019-10-25T13:32:41Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [33991, "2019-10-25T08:38:21Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [61938, "2019-10-24T21:39:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34879, "2019-10-24T19:50:48Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [63835, "2019-10-24T17:11:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "I understand European authorities recently announced they will go their own way in re-certifying the airworthiness of the MAX.\nI see that as a blow to the FAA/WH efforts to hasten the return to service - as a coordinated response by global regulators would be needed to establish the plane's bona fides.\nThanks to @jumpupanddown below for the verbatim transcript on the plain question of \"when\".

Thanks so much.\"  \"this is a very detailed plan that we've laid out with all of our teams and stakeholders and one that we're working together with the FAA and our regulators. In the near term, we're marching through the the technical steps, if you will, and that includes finalizing the software that will go into a series of simulation evaluations, there is a near-term milestone that we referred to as the line pilot evaluation that will take that final software and with external line pilots from airlines come in and evaluate the handling qualities of the airplane.We'll also have a external set of pilots, coming in again authorized by the regulators that will conduct, what we call a joint operations evaluation board and that set of pilots will evaluate the training materials. So over the near term those are 2 key milestones for us, one that evaluates the software update to the airplane and the second that evaluates the training products. In that same time frame, as those 2 milestones are completed, we'll will roll into the certification flight that I mentioned earlier. That will be another key milestone for us. And then after all of the assessments are completed those valuations are done that will roll into the airworthiness directive decision that the FAA will make and that other regulators will make. Subsequent to the issuance of the airworthiness directive in the un-grounding of the airplane, then we would move into the phase of un-grounding the aircraft and incrementally bringing up fleet operations for our airline customers and the reference points that you're seeing out there from our customers are perfectly aligned with the detailed technical plan that I just walk you through. So they are very aware of that plan, and there is a time period between the airworthiness directive and when they can resume full operations revenue bearing [/ph]operations and that includes bringing each individual airplane up, making sure that each airplane is safe and ready to perform. We've been working as we've been storing airplanes to ensure the health of those vehicles. But we'll be working tail number by tail number with our customers to ensure they can bring the fleet up back successfully and then get back to full revenue bearing operations. And that's why you see a bit of a time lag between the airworthiness directive and what our customers are now quoting as going operational dates.

Imagine the headache for the regulators and airline scheduling. It is even worse if the phased-in is due to pilot training.  For example, if EASA requires pilot training for the MAX and the US does not, it means US pilots can only fly a MAX in the US, forever until they get the required training.  To achieve smooth worldwide operations, airlines will need to train the pilots to the highest worldwide requirements/standards.  So a phased-in un-grounding does not benefit the airlines that much in the long run. Furthermore, a phased-in un-grounding provide less confidence to the flying public.  After failing its oversight on the MAX and being the last regulator to ground the MAX after two fatal accidents, can FAA keep a straight face in declaring it knows better and ignore EASA\u2019s more restricted requirements? Finally, it is still possible that all the regulators come to an agreement in re-certifying the MAX in Q4.  However I think that pilot training for the MAX will be part of the certification at the end.  (Remember that MACS was put in to make the MAX fly like an older 737 so that pilot training would not be required.  I suspect the modified MCAS will make flying the MAX different from an older 737.)  The time needed for pilot training will push the MAX flying into 2020 (which is the forecast question).

The National Transportation Safety Board\u00a0. . . faulted the company for making erroneous assumptions during the development of the jet and pushed for broader changes in the way airplanes are certified. The agency said Boeing had underestimated the effect that a malfunction of new automated software in the aircraft could have on the environment in the cockpit.  . . .  Boeing did not fully inform pilots about how MCAS functioned until after the first accident. The safety board calls for Boeing and federal regulators to revamp the way they assess the risk of key systems on airplanes, by giving more weight to how a cacophony of alerts could affect pilots\u2019 responses to emergencies. The safety board\u2019s suggestions are not binding, but the Federal Aviation Administration has accepted the vast majority of its recommendations in the past. . . . officials with the safety board suggested that Boeing was too confident the average pilot could easily recover the plane in that situation, because the company had not considered the chaos that ensued inside the cockpit.\n. . .\n. . . the company and federal regulators face multiple federal investigations into how the plane was built and certified in the first place. In a meeting last month, Boeing struggled to answer a raft of questions from international regulators and the F.A.A. about a software fix it has been working on to make the plane safer.\n. . . \nMs. Schulze said the agency would like the F.A.A. to review Boeing\u2019s safety assessment of MCAS before allowing the plane to fly again. . . . The safety board recommended that the F.A.A. require Boeing and other manufacturers to consider the effect of multiple cockpit warnings when assessing how quickly pilots will respond to a malfunction. It also suggested that the agency direct plane makers to develop technology that could diagnose a problem during flight and tell pilots what procedure to follow.\n. . .\nResults of an internal review by Boeing . . .  recommended changes to the design of cockpits and the company\u2019s organizational structure to improve safety. . . . A task force composed of several international regulators is expected to submit a report this month on how the plane was certified.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://in.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-airplane-ntsb/boeing-assumptions-on-737-max-emergency-response-faulted-ntsb-idINKBN1WB2MI \u201cWe want FAA to ensure that Boeing takes a close look at all these different failure conditions that can activate MCAS and ensure that they have evaluated the pilots\u2019 response to that,\u201d Dana Schulze, director of the NTSB Office of Aviation Safety, told reporters. NTSB wants that assessment completed before the plane\u2019s grounding is lifted. Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX simulator tests with test pilots \u201cdid not look at all potential flight deck alerts and indications that pilots might face when this specific failure condition occurred in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines,\u201d Schulze said, adding that Boeing did not evaluate the \u201cactual scenario\u201d of the two fatal crashes in the simulator. Boeing should \u201cmore clearly and concisely inform pilots of the highest priority actions when multiple flight deck alerts and indications are present,\u201d the NTSB said.\n. . . \n\u201cCommercial airplanes should be able to be safely flown by an appropriately-trained pilot on his or her worst day,\u201d DeFazio added. The FAA said in a statement it \u201cwill carefully review these and all other recommendations as we continue our review of the proposed changes to the Boeing 737 MAX.\u201d Boeing, in a statement, said it is \u201ccommitted to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations.\u201d\n. . . \nThe NTSB said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing and other manufacturers make in designing software systems to react to emergencies, and whether the systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms and alerts. The safety board also said the FAA should develop \u201crobust tools and methods\u201d to validate assumptions about pilot response. Boeing is revising the 737 MAX software to require the MCAS system to receive input from both AOA sensors, and has added additional safeguards.\n. . . \nIt is not clear when Boeing will conduct a key certification test flight, a step needed before the FAA can return the plane to service. The company has said it hopes to resume flights early in the fourth quarter. The FAA said last week it will need a month after the test flight is completed before it could allow flights to resume.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/09/29/easa-clarifies-position-boeing-737-max-return-service/ On Sept. 27, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) clarified statements it made that were recently published . . . \n Upon publishing the statement of clarification, the agency also noted its next milestones for the investigation include an upcoming week of flight testing on a modified 737 MAX flight simulator. . . .  \u201cAircraft longitudinal stability is subject to airworthiness requirements. Boeing has to demonstrate compliance of the 737 MAX airframe with these requirements. Consequences of failures of systems affecting potentially the aircraft stability need to be assessed using acceptable safety analysis methodology also subject to airworthiness requirements,\u201d EASA said in its published statement. The agency declined to comment on several aspects of the ongoing investigation, including the level of delegation granted by the FAA to Boeing in certification of the 737 MAX and the possibility of necessitating hardware changes, aircraft redesign or pilot re-training on full-motion flight simulators in order to return the global fleet of MAX aircraft to service that have been grounded since March. Flight and simulator evaluation by EASA officials occurred in June and July, with the statement noting that evaluation resulted in \u201c70 test points to be evaluated covering both normal and abnormal operations.\u201d \u201cIn the case of the B737 max, our review of pilot training requirements is not completed yet and we have not reached a conclusion yet on that matter,\u201d EASA said.\n. . .  \n\u201cAs you make your own decisions about returning the MAX to service, we will continue to make available to you all that we have learned, all that we have done, and all of our assistance,\u201d FAA Administrator] Dickson said.\n. . .\nEASA is one of the civil aviation regulatory agencies represented on the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) group, lead by former National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Christopher Hart, was also established by the FAA specifically to conduct a review of the certification of the 737 MAX\u2019s automated flight control system.

Boeing Co (BA.N) still has a series of steps to complete before the 737 MAX can return to service, including submitting a pre-production version of a software update, Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson said. Dickson met with Boeing executives in Renton, Washington on Thursday and tested revised software in a simulator. . . . \nThe FAA has been reviewing proposed software and training changes from Boeing Co (BA.N) for months and it remains uncertain when Boeing will conduct a certification test flight,  . . .  . . . Dickson laid out a series of steps that must happen before the certification test flight, adding it should then take about another month before the FAA could allow flights to resume absent unforeseen circumstances. \u201cI am not going to sign off on the plane until I am personally satisfied,\u201d he said. Some government officials have told Reuters they do not believe Boeing will conduct the certification flight until at least mid-October. Asked if there are at least several weeks of work to be done before that flight can occur, Dickson said he thought that was a \u201cfair statement,\u201d but did not want to set a specific date.\n. . .\nFAA still needs to see Boeing\u2019s \u201cfinal system description\u201d - a \u201c500-ish page document that has the architecture of the flight control system and the changes that they have made,\u201d Dickson said, adding that the software changes must be in a \u201cpre-production\u201d code and not a \u201cbeta version\u201d. \u201cWe need to see that level of refinement and there has been a good bit of back and forth and some constructive discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil it is locked down, we\u2019ve got to go make sure that there aren\u2019t any new fault trees that have developed that need to be mitigated.\u201d Once the system description is completed, the FAA will work with Boeing to develop the \u201cintegrated system safety analysis\u201d - a step that will take a few days. Then the FAA will move to the next phase - the pilot workload management scenarios. Once that is done, the agency will be \u201cmuch closer to a predictable timeline for when the actual certification test flight will occur.\u201d The FAA plans to get input from international regulators EASA, Canada and Brazil. \u201cWe\u2019ve got U.S. and international pilots that have to be scheduled to come out and actually go through the scenarios,\u201d Dickson said, adding it must also finalize training requirements. Boeing plans to revise the 737 MAX software to take input from both angle-of-attack sensors in the anti-stall system linked to the two deadly crashes.\n~~~~~~~\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/getting-the-boeing-737-max-flying-again-will-require-less-confusion-in-the-cockpit.html PUBLISHED FRI, SEP 27 2019  . . . \n. . .\nAs Boeing moves closer to applying for recertification of the 737 Max, it\u2019s becoming clear the company has to prove that its redesigned flight system won\u2019t confuse pilots when it kicks in.\n. . . \nSafety experts believe pilot training will be critical to eliminating any possible confusion in the cockpit. That includes Christopher Hart, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to revisit the standards that we use to determine if this automation is interfacing properly with the human,\u201d Hart said in an interview.\n. . . \nThe company believes pilots won\u2019t be confused when the new MCAS anti-stall software kicks in. The software has been redesigned so it won\u2019t repeatedly lower the nose of the airplane as pilots are trying to pull up . . .  \u201cThe accident pilot responses to the unintended MCAS operation were not consistent with the underlying assumptions about pilot recognition and response that Boeing used, based on FAA guidance, for flight control system functional hazard assessments, including for MCAS, as part of the 737 MAX design,\u201d was one conclusion of the NTSB. In short, the NTSB concluded that pilots were confused and that may have contributed to their inability to keep their planes from crashing. That\u2019s not to say the crashes were due to human error. Investigators in Indonesia and Ethiopia have not released their final reports on the accidents, but initial reports indicate the design of the 737 Max, the repeated engagement of MCAS and the reaction of the pilots were factors in the crashes. The NTSB report concluded, \u201cneither Boeing\u2019s system safety assessment nor its simulator tests evaluated how the combined effect of alerts and indications might impact pilots\u2019 recognition of which procedure(s) to prioritize in responding to an unintended MCAS operation caused by an erroneous AOA (angle of attack) input.\u201d In response to the findings, Boeing issued a statement saying, \u201cSafety is a core value for everyone at Boeing and the safety of our airplanes, our customers\u2019 passengers and crews is always our top priority. We value the role of the NTSB in promoting aviation safety. We are committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the NTSB recommendations.\u201d Boeing believes computer-based training will ensure pilots are clear about the modifications being made to the Max. But aviation regulators from different countries and regions around the world may require pilots to do additional training in 737 Max simulators. Hart, who is part of a panel reviewing the FAA certification process, won\u2019t say if Max pilots should go through additional simulator training, but he believes the industry needs to rethink how simulators can better prepare pilots to remain calm in emergency situations. \u201cI think the use of pilots in the engineering simulator has to involve a wide variety of pilots, not just your crack test pilots. It needs to look at different ages too because I think the millennials may respond differently than other ages,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people are growing up who grew up on computers, they\u2019re going to respond very differently than people who didn\u2019t grow up on computers.\u201d\n. . .\nThe head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, has actually been in the 737 Max simulator and has experienced how the plane is designed to operate with the updated MCAS software. Dickson, a former pilot who is certified to fly the 737, has not said publicly what he thinks of the changes to the plane or if pilots will notice them. Before visiting going in the Max simulator last week, Dickson said: \u201cI will learn what the pilots were dealing with in these scenarios and looking at how the failure modes presented themselves. We need to take a holistic look at the process and not just look at it item by item, make sure we are accounting for the human element.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENTS;  Bottomline for me is that I'm going back to being negative about this happening in Q4 because\n-more and more agencies and organizations are weighing in, and it sounds to me like each is trying to out-do the other to show that they are the ones who are best at safeguarding the flying public:  the regulatory picture is getting more complicated and the ante is being raised\n-it seemed that it was just a software problem.

Boeing\u2019s plan to deliver its update in September seems to be slipping. It is already Sept 20 and there are no signs they are close to delivering (of course absence of evidence is not evidence of absence). As Boeing is abstaining from giving updates, it seems they don\u2019t want to be held to that deadline.  2) Certification flight - 1st week of Oct 3) FAA recert - 1st week of November. FAA will need 30 days they said from the recert. flight.  4) Crew retraining: Mid November: 1-3 weeks to have a few crews trained so flights can be scheduled. Unions will get FAA\u2019s proposal in September and have 30 days to comment on it. So let\u2019s say by 1 week of November that they\u2019ve reached an agreement. 5) Airplane maintenance - a few weeks to maintain a few planes that can start o be put in service. Occurs in parallel with crew retraining and starts after FAA recertification, so early November. 6) Scheduling flights - airlines need a month or more to schedule flights and crews. In this most optimistic timeline, they will be able to start scheduling Max flights in mid November, so a commercial flight can conceivably take place late December. Conclusion - that is why I am not ruling out the third bucket. However, as I have mentioned before it is likely that FAA will not certify before other world agencies are ready to certify, which would introduce a much greater delay.

Following are some of the key steps that need to take place before the 737 MAX returns to the skies. SOFTWARE UPDATES AND FLIGHT TESTS Boeing is still finalizing updates to flight control software, which will be followed by a certification test flight. CEO Dennis Muilenburg has said he was targeting the September timeframe for the flight but on Wednesday declined to give a specific date. Federal officials say it may not occur until October and the FAA may not give the green light to resume flights until November. Boeing and FAA pilots have been testing the updated software for months and the FAA is inviting regular 737 MAX line pilots to run tests as well. Those tests must also be completed before the aircraft is approved for return to service, the FAA has said. PILOT TRAINING The FAA\u2019s Flight Standardization Board that determines U.S. pilot-training requirements must issue new recommendations for what kind of training is needed before U.S. airlines can fly passengers on the 737 MAX again. The final report is expected in September and will have a 30-day period for comments from airlines and pilots. A draft report in April recommended short computer-based training and classroom instruction about the new software. Simulator training, which some overseas regulators are weighing, would take longer and is more costly. CERTIFICATION Once the software updates, test flights and pilot training recommendations are finalized, the FAA must approve the jets for flight and has said it will need about 30 days from the time the certification flight is completed before it decides whether to allow flights to resume. The agency has repeatedly said it will not certify the plane until it is safe to do so. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said on Tuesday will conduct its own test flights separate from, but in full coordination with, the FAA. The test flights are not scheduled yet and depend on Boeing\u2019s progress. Muilenburg has said it is possible not all regulators around the world will concurrently approve the MAX to fly again. Some officials do not expect the 737 MAX to actually resume flights until early 2020. COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS Without the 737 MAX, airlines that were flying the jets before its grounding have had to cancel flights, cut routes and use aging jetliners. Once the MAX is approved to fly again, airlines will have to install the new software, run a series of maintenance checks on the idled jets and implement the recommended pilot training. U.S. airlines are hoping to fly the jets again later this year or early next year, pending regulatory approval."], [19829, "2019-09-20T04:22:05Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [38, "2019-09-20T02:02:03Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.85], "https://www.lse.co.uk/news/update-1-ryanair-expects-to-be-flying-boeing-737-max-by-feb-march-2020-iulza413s99i7rs.html \"Sept 19 (Reuters) - Ryanair thinks February or the start of March is the most realistic timetable for it to start flying the grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, CEO Michael O'Leary . . .\n. . . \nMajor U.S. airlines have cancelled flights of the MAX into December, while Southwest Airlines Co has cancelled flights into early January.

The work has so far concentrated on the MCAS but it seems EASA is saying that additional checks and guarantees of safety are needed.

Another step in the process is a review by the FAA's Flight Standardization Board, which must recommend training requirements for the plane. In April, it made a preliminary conclusion that pilots wouldn't need simulator training before flights resume. But the body hasn't issued its final conclusions.

That will require some pretty serious real world flying hours. (Previous groundings are 100% irrelevant and any similarity will be coincidental.) Once they fix it they have to market it. Penance is important and a new calendar year seems like a basic marketing requirement to re-launch. Also, these planes and engines (and tires and doors and shitty coffee brewers) are made to fly not to sit on the ground for 10 months.  They all need some basic maintenance and air time. Any sane airline CEO will commit to a reasonable re-flying program, where every plane gets 10-25 launch/land cycles and every crew member gets to at least ride the middle seat for four or five of these. That is less time than it sounds like as they rotate Equipment in to service but still days or weeks. Edit here: ANNINAK's report on the July test represents a frankly devastating result for the current planned fix. Boeing's response appears notably cavalier and does NOT appear to involve actually re-tooling the fix itself. Instead they plan to further butterfly effect the whole system.  It sounds like the coffee pot and the tire pressure alarms might genuinely be auto-flying my ass off 17R in Denver through a high altitude tornado spawning zero vis summer high temperature squall line.  And wtf are the Pilots going to be told here? Curious what their reaction would be to the tests. (It looks like the revised fix is to add a whole new flight computer as a back up while rerouting the critical data through other systems'  microchips). More cowbell I guess. Once \"the Fix is In\" it will have to be installed/uploaded, certified, tested all along the paper trail.  Then, perhaps for the first 3-5 planes each carrier puts back up, they may well choose to fly them through some limit testing conditions - winds, density air temp, airfield elevation and runway length.   Keep in mind, they have to be un-grounded before they can be flight tested by the carriers. Even a hasty af test program will (had better) take weeks to fulfill. They will have to fly a few to Morocco for cross winds and Greenland for cold weather  (or wherever they can get away with), which will require international un-grounding / clearance as well.  It seems very likely they will encounter one or two \"glitches\".  If any carrier around the world -  any level of experience or competent operations -  dumps a Max after they get re-certified people are going to prison, so I expect such glitches will get a proper paper trail of CYA which will add a few weeks even for a minor occurrence or anomaly..  If I was a marketing advisor to a US carrier's CEO I'd be advising them to fill the first one with money and give it all to Chesty Sullenburger (and maybe a certain politically inclined former Astronaut or another certain politically inclined former female combat pilot) if they host a live-streamed series of mixed weather t/o landing cycles as explainer videos.

Boeing 737 Max Software Fix Is Too Slow\nWritten by Harry Fairhead   \nWednesday, 10 July 2019 The situation with the Boeing Max 737 is rapidly becoming a textbook case on how not to implement embedded systems and how not to deal with problems. It now seems that the software fix that will return the plane to the skies overloads its flight computer. The New York Times has a report that in flight simulator tests of the new software a pilot was unable to follow the procedure to regain control of the plane. The key quote is: \"The issue discovered last week is linked to the data-processing speed of a specific flight control computer chip, according to the two people with knowledge of the matter. In the test, the F.A.A. pilot encountered delays in executing a crucial step required to stabilize an aircraft.\" dual 80286 with CPUs from different manufacturers is the most likely. There are two of these systems and either are capable of handling the demands of the plane in most situations. However according to one ex-Boeing engineer: The 737 dual-dual architecture is very unique. The decision to make speed trim single channel, single processor goes back to the 737 classic. The MCAS function is just another FCC software module that behaves, at a high level, like speed trim, whose architecture would have then been replicated. This seems to be saying that the MCAS system that is being revised only runs on one of the processors in one of the systems.

Source: Boeing 737 Max has new flaw New York (CNN Business)Boeing's very bad year just got worse. It is now facing the very real possibility that the 737 Max crisis will stretch into next year.\nEven after it gets the planes back in the air, it will have to make deliveries of new planes to its customers. Until that backlog is cleared up, its earnings will suffer.\nThe company, had its best-selling 737 Max grounded in March following two fatal crashes, said this week that it will have to delay its efforts to get the plane back in the air because a new potential problem with the jet has been discovered during testing. Experts have been expecting that the planes could be back in the air by August. The three US airlines that own the 737 Max -- Southwest (LUV), United (UAL) and American (AAL) airlines - had canceled flights using that plane only through early September.\nBut now a Boeing (BA) official confirmed to CNN Business that the company does not expect to submit a new software fix to the US Federal Aviation Administration for testing until September. \"We believe this can be updated through a software fix,\" said the official. The new time frame was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nBut it is not certain that a software fix will be the final solution.\nNew flaw discovered on Boeing 737 Max, sources say Sources familiar with the testing process told CNN Business this week that the new problem is a failure of a microprocessor that could push the nose of the plane toward the ground. It is not known whether the microprocessor played a role in either crash. But it is too great of a risk to not be addressed, the sources said.\nIf the FAA determines that there needs to be a hardware fix in addition to a software fix, that could further delay the return to service.\nBoeing said it agreed with the FAA's decision to make additional changes.\n\"Boeing will not offer the 737 MAX for certification by the FAA until...it's safe return to service,\" said the company's statement.\nBut even if only a software fix is needed, it will likely be months after that fix is submitted in September before the plane is granted approval to fly again by the FAA.\nThat means the earliest Boeing and airlines can hope to have the plane flying again will be sometime close to the end of the year.\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/29/business/boeing-737-max-outlook/index.html"], [75616, "2019-07-01T03:42:59Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [19127, "2019-07-01T00:32:04Z", [0.01, 0.17, 0.82], ""], [75611, "2019-07-01T00:06:01Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.6], "I would have said October in time for holiday rush but not with the new software issue found and no plan on re-training pilots"], [5018, "2019-06-30T22:43:12Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [35, "2019-06-30T22:24:15Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [2430, "2019-06-30T19:51:32Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "Too many unknowns:  1) Boeing certainly is not willing to share, which usually indicates there is 'more to come', and 2) The FAA keeps expanding their investigation scope.

Assessment of the author's article and Guzzettii: \"That means the earliest Boeing and airlines can hope to have the plane flying again will be sometime close to the end of the year. \"I don't know if I'd say it's best case scenario, but that's what's likely,\" said Jeffrey Guzzetti, a former director of the FAA's accident investigation division.\" Not sure what Guzzetti means by \"likely\" there. Does he mean the mode of the probability distribution? Seems unlikely that would be the mode. Ultimately, it's important to consider Kahneman and Tversky's planning fallacy. Complicated projects usually take longer than one initially believes. Think for example about Larry Summers's strategy: when an employee gave him a timeline he doubled the employee\u2019s estimate, then moved to the next higher time unit. So, if the research assistant says the task will take an hour, it will take two days. If he says two days, it will take four weeks. Adding on top of that Boeing's incentive to be optimistic (to prevent its stock price from falling further), I am guessing that a resolution before end of the year is quite unlikely.

Some of the historical groundings listed were for reasons not inherent to the aircraft (e.g. poor maintenance). Others were a long time away when aviation didn't feature the same high level of standards and engineering capability. ~~~\nInside view\n~~~ POM:\nPlayers: Boeing, Airlines, and FAA mostly. The public perception also matters to a degree. \nOpportunities: The FAA holds the ultimate power to decide from my understanding. Boeing has strong engineering expertise and has made this issue its priority. Since the question refers to the first take-off, airlines are an important player.\nMotives (incentives): FAA is likely to err on the side of caution. Boeing has to get the airplanes back in service as fast as possible. Airlines also want a resolution asap. But they are driven by public perception and hence demand. So, given that it depends on FAA to determine that Boeing has done its job, how bad is the problem?\n- Boeing has been arguing that resolving the problem with the MCAS automated flight control system requires a software fix (i.e. not very time consuming) [4]\n- However, FAA just found a new problem with the in-flight control chip [4]. This is unrelated to the MCAS problem. Timeline:\n- The FAA has explicitly refused to offer timelines\n- Boeing official - \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a September time frame for a full software package to fix both MCAS and this new issue,\u201d [4] A Sept timeframe to deliver the fixes means more time for the FAA to test the solution and make its own determination. Further as stated in [4] \"Boeing will need to reach agreement with airlines and pilots unions on how much extra training pilots will need. And the airlines will need some time to complete necessary maintenance checks.\" \n- Systemic issues at Boeing are being uncovered [5] which suggest a longer timeframe to reestablish the trust of regulators (and the public). Outstanding questions:\n- how much time will it take from FAA's ruling to the first take-off of a 737 Max?\n- Will pilots need lengthy training?\n- will a \"rogue\" airline decide to fly a 737 Max prior to FAA ruling? I ascribe a very small chance to that.

Although the test pilot ultimately recovered control, the system was slow to respond to the proper runaway stabilizer checklist steps, due to the microprocessor being overwhelmed with data. This slow response led the FAA to characterize the issue as \"catastrophic\", whereas Boeing initially classed it as \"major\". Boeing believes that the issue can be fixed in software by rerouting data across multiple chips. However, this new software update will not be ready for evaluation until at least September 2019.[309] In a statement, Boeing said that it agreed with additional requirements that the FAA required it to fulfill, and added that it was working toward resolving the safety risk.
