The current population is 184,000 as of Dec. 28, 2017.   I believe the population will continue to decline during the next 90 days.  The question is by how much. It appears that the driving factor in the prison population reduction over the past few years is attributed to two main factors:\n1)  Justice department guidance under the Obama administration to seek lower sentences for non-violent drug offenses (which account for 1/3 of the federal prison population).\n2)  The reduction in sentences of existing prisoners that committed non-violent drug offenses by the United States Sentencing Commission.  The sentencing panel estimated that roughly 46,000 of 100,000 drug offenders in federal lockup would qualify for early release.  These reductions lead to a bump in releases in 2016 from inmates reaching a new earlier release date (including many who \"overserved\" their sentences) and continued in 2017 and will continue in 2018.   Even though Attorney General Sessions has directed prosecutors to pursue the most severe penalties possible,  those outcomes won't affect the prisoner releases over the next 3 months - those are already \"baked in\".   Seeking the most severe punishments also doesn't affect conviction rate, so I don't expect incarceration rates to skyrocket in the next few months.  And, the first 90 days of a sentence is the same regardless of the length of the prison sentence. Also, the Federal bench is suffering from a historic level of vacancy time.  Less judges means the wheels of justice take longer to turn.  That's another factor against a rising incarceration rate in the next 3 months. So how much will the decline be in the next 90 days?  I'm forecasting less than 4,000 releases in the first quarter of 2018.   2016 had the largest dip in prison population (-13,553) in available statistical data (1980 - present).  That year included an extra large cohort of resentenced inmates.  I'd expect 2018 to continue the 2017 trend of ~8,000 drop in population which would be about a 2,000 drop in a quarter. I couldn't find any data indicating that releases are front-loaded during the course of a year.

So we have two data points, and to go ahead and kill some time this morning, I counted 36 weeks remaining for this question (although perhaps 37 is more accurate, as they note the question will be resolved the following week, April 5). Assuming a steady decrease of 57 inmates a week for the next 36 (or 37 weeks) despite having no reason to believe this is an accurate assumption, that means the federal prison population will be 185,380 on March 29th (or 185,323 on April 5th) with a decrease of 2,052 during the question period. Obviously, we'll need a few more weeks of data to get a better understanding of the trend, but this is not an unrealistic decline rate. With the exception of 2016, which saw a decrease of over 13K (or 1,100 per month avg), most of Obama's tenure was marked an average annual net change in prison population of 4K (or +/- 342 per month). A steady decline of 57/wk would be 228/mo, which would be below Obama's net average but greater than the actual changes in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. So, in the realm of possible. However, none of this takes into account presidential pardons and clemency, changes to sentencing, changes to policy, and prosecutors' discretion. Being tough on crime is easy, with DA's having large amounts of influence and discretion in the legal system (see the July 19, 2017, episode of VICE News Tonight on HBO for a good description, as well as http://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/schooling-krasner-philadelphia-district-attorney/), these positions are gaining prominence in the electoral battle. And while progressive prosecutors have made some gains recently, in much of America, the electorate still wants a tough-on-crime prosecutor when they go to the polls. All of this means that DA's will continue to influence the overall U.S. prison population, to include the federal population, with the results likely being an uptick in the population, especially if AG Sessions and DOJ begin to leverage federal funding to states as a means of gaining compliance with new stricter policies. Slight adjustments, as I think below 180K and over 195K are both out of range for this. I'm skeptical of below 185K as well, as I think the renewed \"tough on crime\" mantra of the GOP continues to resonate more effectively with Americans, despite evidence to the contrary.

Third, many district and appellate judges were Obama appointments and unless they are confronted with mandatory sentencing, may opt to keep people out of the slammer, and that's before you get to bench trials in which Obama judges may find a defendant Not Guilty rather than BoP fodder.  Fourth, many states' jury pools consist mostly of adults who will acquit low-level offenders rather than send them off to the tender mercies of Jeff Sessions.  So while this stupid policy will undoubtedly increase BoP populations over the medium term (at your expense and mine and to no other actual effect, by the way), the big BoP population explosion may not hit until second or third Q of '18.  On the other hand, I could be completely wrong.

Couple that with low likelihood of Trump granting pardons or clemency, especially at the levels of Obama during his last 3 years in office (https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics#obama), and an increased federal prison population seems more likely.  As reported by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, almost half of the federal prison population is serving time for drug crimes (https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/BOP_Feb2017.pdf). 95% of federal and state criminal cases are convicted through plea bargaining (https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=23).

Continuing at this average rate with 256 days left until March 30th, 2018 is another 6342 fewer prisoners. Since current is 187,489 prisoners as of July 13, 2017, that comes out to 187489-6342=181147 prisoners on March 30th, 2018. The graph has been concave down since before 2011. It would be very helpful if I knew at what point in time the 192170 prisoners was counted at in 2016. Was that at some arbitrary point during 2016 or was that as of December 31st? If that was on Dec 31st, then right now in 2017 we are on track to decrease by (192170-187489)*(365/195)=8761 prisoners. Since that is substantially less than last year, this would mean that the graph is now concave up in 2017. (Note: If the 2016 prisoner count was from an earlier date in 2016, then that would mean that the rate at which the prison population is decreasing would have slowed even more). Since the graph is now concave up, we can expect the number of prisoners in the rest of 2017 to decrease by a smaller amount per day than in 2017 so far, meaning that in 2017 we are actually on track to decrease by less than 8761 prisoners--I'll guess about 7000--so less than in 2014-2015. Perhaps the first three months of 2018 will decrease at about the same as 2013-2014 then. So this comes out to about 183,900 prisoners on March 30th, 2018. Ranking the thousand-prisoner-ranges in the order that seems most likely I would say (with probability estimates): List:\n183-184k (16%)\n184-185k (15%)\n185-186k (12%)\n182-183k (11%)\n186-187k (9%)\n181-182k (8%)\n187-188k (7%)\n188-189k (5%)\n180-181k (5%)\n189-190k (3%)\n<180k (4%)\n>190k (5%) Note that I put a little more weight on there being more than 184k prisoners rather than less than 184k prisoners (56% vs 44%) because of the thought that Trump may tend to increase incarceration. March 30th, 2018 is less than year away, and even if Trump has this effect in the long run I am skeptical that he will immediately cause this effect. In the coming months as we get more information on the current number of inmates I expect to either concentrate my probabilities near the top of my List above or else shift them slightly downwards (fewer prisoners) or more significantly upwards (more prisoners).

Looking at Bureau of Prison statistics, there were 187,489 federal inmates as of July 13, 2017 (https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp). Using the raw data, the federal prison population increased by 65K during Clinton's two terms, and 56K during Bush's two terms, both during a time of increased law enforcement and prison privatization. During Obama's two terms, the population decreased overall by just over 9K, after increasing by approximately 18K for the first 5 years before decreasing by approximately 26K in the last 3. With AG Sessions pushing for renewed emphasis on drug enforcement and stricter punishment for offenders, coupled with his strong advocacy for increasing the private prison industry in the U.S., it seems likely this number will increase during Trump's term.  Again using BOP data, the federal prison population increased by almost 9K during Clinton's first year in office, over 11K during Bush's first year in office, and 7K during Obama's first year in office. However, these increases followed a general increase trend set by their predecessors administrations. So while Trump and Sessions may desire significantly increasing the federal prison population, the policies and regulations enacted during the last few years of Obama's administration indicates that the increases will not be as significant as previous administrations' first years.  Of course, there's always the wild card of the population itself and the general federal crime rates, which I will have to research more. Additionally, I'll have to look into how, if at all, the population of prisoners who have completed their sentences will affect these numbers. 1992 was 25 years ago, so there's a possibility that those who were first swept up with stricter sentences in the early to mid 1990's could be paroled or released in the coming months and years. I don't have any information that would indicate this would have a noticeable effect, but will have to research further to be sure.  With that, I think it's really whether the numbers fall in the 185-190K or the 190-195K range. It's possible it could fall into the other brackets, but I would need to look at the monthly data from BOP to better assess. Obviously, I'll be checking the BOP site weekly to collect data and better map the trend over the coming months."], [1333, "2017-07-14T17:22:49Z", [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2], ""], [36281, "2017-07-14T17:21:29Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35], "I don't think that incarceration will decrease by any great extent"]], "open_date": "2017-07-14T17:00:04Z", "close_date": "2018-03-31T06:59:04Z"}
