My current guess is that the best strategy could be to check a brief history of protests along the world and from that improve the outside view. Two questions come to mind: 1) Do legal and political means make protests disappear?\n2) Do the use of force do the trick? The answer to 1) is \"maybe, but it is probably not particularly effective\", while the answer to 2) is \"yes, with a high degree of confidence\". However this is based on anecdotal evidence, diagonal reading and a few random memories of past events, not on a detailed review of past protests cases. I have a few lectures in the waiting [1,2,3,4,5], but of course if some of you guys could take a look and provide a summary that would be great @Emil @A356 @KitsonJ @Orao  My impression is that Beijing has probably considered these aspects and has some assessment of whether the security law is really going to work or not. Maybe the decision tree is somehow like this: 1) Try the law and check these two things:\n  1.a) are protests receding?\n  1.b) what is the answer of the international community? 2) If the answer to 1.a) is \"no\", while for 1.b) there is no substantive backlash, then maybe there is no harm in using the PLA/PAP Things might be tipping towards 2): the HKers have very quickly found a new way to protest with blank pieces of paper, and I must admit that I am amazed at their resourcefulness and creativity, while the international reaction mostly consists of words and easing immigration to the HKers. However there is the eternal problem of which is the time frame: China tends to go ahead relentlessly, but more often than not slowly. Besides, there is another seemingly unrelated factor which could play a role: a future Chinese vaccine, which if developed or mass produced before competitors, will for sure be used as political leverage. This could indeed embolden Beijing to advance any future plans they have for HK.

The most direct way to systematize the prediction of a probability is to fermi-ize the answer, which in this case is not that difficult: P = P_pro x P_pla with P_pro the probability of a protest big enough as to overwhelm the local police forces and P_pla the probability of the PLA being mobilize. However it could be more complicated than this because there could be several protest that reach this threshold, in which case we should have something like P = 1 - Sum_n P_{n-pro} X (1- P_pla)^n  with the condition that Sum_n P_{n-pro} = 1 where the complication in the math is to indicate that the probability is better expressed as 1 minus the probability of nothing happening: P_{n-pro} is the probability of having n big enough protest, which sums to 1 (Sum_n P_{n-pro} = 1), and if there are n big protests in total, the probability of the PLA not entering is  (1- P_pla)^n. The core of this question is that P_pro is considered to be high (closer to 1 than to 0), while P_pla was considered to be really low. The PLA troops entering HK could be considered a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, but I guess that even this could be subject to interpretation (I did not check the declaration in detail, despite having it around here). The reason why the question is here is to try to assess how likely is that the CCP will decide to cross that red line. Now here there are two balancing acts that are difficult to assess: 1) Do we expect more or less big demonstration as past year? 1.a) In favor of more we have the grit and perseverance of the demonstrators and the incendiary nature of the National Security Law: once and again, every time that the demonstrations seemed to be going to fade, they just kept going. Of course there must be a limit on that, but I am not sure which limit is that. Besides, this is in a sense a fundamental trait of this confrontation: Chinese culture is gritty, very gritty. Both the protestors and the CCP consider this to be a long term struggle where neither side should back down.  Besides, I remember when the LEGCO was taken one year ago, there was the theory that it was a false flag operation. I did not follow suit, so I do not know if there is a consensus about this right now. The problem when dealing with the CCP is that it is simply not possible to discard this type of conspiranoid theories, after all they rose to power partly through these means. 1.b) Against we have the punitive character of the National Security Law, which seems to have already have some effect in the sense of avoiding showing public support for the protest. The approach of the Chinese side here is to be as punitive as possible, but also as vague as possible, so they can use the law for arbitrary political purposes (this is a typical CCP move). 2) The probability of the PLA entering to \"save the day\" 2.a) In favor we have the fact that the National Security Law is already a \"crossing the Rubicon\" moment. The threshold for crossing it again should be lower. Besides, a mobilization of the PLA would be viewed very positively by the Chinese citizens on the mainland: I just remember about one year ago, when the incident on the airport happened, how in my Wechat feed several of my contacts were clamoring for an intervention to restore order. This second observation makes me think that if such thing were going to happen it could more likely be linked to the needs of internal mainland politics than by the situation in HK. 2.b) Against we have again the National Security Law itself, which is simply a very ambiguous factor. In principle with it there should be better \"legal tools\" (to give it some name) to deal with demonstrations and any type of pro-democracy movement within HK. However before the National Security Law there were already a lot of \"extrajudicial tools\" available to achieve this goal. Again, even here there is a difficult balance to consider. There is also another factor in my mind: the experience with Xinjiang suggest that even in the absence of actual events (in the case of Xinjiang, the protests date from more than 10 years ago), simply the existence of perceived threats will push the current leadership to tighten its grip and issue more punitive measures. Against this factor is the ethno-nationalistic nature of the CCP: measures taken against national minorities, such as the Uyghurs, are less likely to be taken against Han chinese.

The recent 'Security Law' hints at a speeding up (of the speeding up) of this process. The CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is seizing the opportunity brought about by COVID-19. And recently, they have gained the leverage of hypocrisy due to the BLM protests - making criticisms less valid. In the very short term - there will be marches on July 1 (anniversary of the handover). The Security Law will most likely be passed in the next few days, enabling some form of retaliation. From which Chinese organization and in what form is a difficult question.  There is some evidence that the PAP is already in Hong Kong: \n\"Responding to questions from Reuters, the Chinese Defence Ministry said the PAP was not stationed in Hong Kong, while a Hong Kong police spokesman said they 'stress that there is no such visit or observation by any members of the mainland law enforcement agencies'.\"\n\"The diplomat and three other foreign envoys, however, estimated that China\u2019s government had ramped up the paramilitary People\u2019s Armed Police (PAP) presence in Hong Kong to as many as 4,000 personnel - far more than previously known estimates.\"\n\"taken together with the numbers of PLA troops that also expanded last year, the estimated 12,000-strong force marks the largest ever Chinese security deployment in Hong Kong.\" [1] \"The law will also establish a new security agency in the territory to enforce the security restrictions, and Beijing will create its own separate security arm in Hong Kong, empowered to investigate special cases and collect intelligence, according to a summary issued by China\u2019s legislature.\" [2] The PLA or PAP could be disguised as a different organisation (such as the one above) and used if rioting started. Would this security agency count as the PAP? probably.  In the longer term (next 6 months) an altercation seems very possible. From the CCP's perspective, I can't see a better opportunity to combat the riots than right now. However, this could be counter-intuitive and cause more sanctions - harming an already weakened economy. Furthermore, polls show a decline in support for the protests, and the 1 July one may involve fewer people and violence, lowering the incentive to used armed police [3]. COVID-19 could also prevent action.  If I was in the CCP and had their vision, I would use fake protesters to instigate some extreme damage e.g. fires in areas that do not put people's lives at risk. This would turn more people against the protests and give the mobilization of Chinese security agencies validity.   This week should be a good indicator for the next 6 months. Criticism is very welcome!

Firstly, we should note that neither the PLA nor the PAP have ever been used in Hong Kong since the handover. Any change of this policy would cause domestic and international outrage in light of the 'one country, two systems' principle. Furthermore, China, conscious of its soft power, will be keen to avoid any Tiananmen-style images going around the world. However, engagement by either the PLA or PAP would not necessarily be as violent as the Tiananmen massacre. They could simply act as reinforcements for the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF). As Carrie Lam has said, the HKPF has been 'outnumbered' in recent protests. These comments, in addition to comments by the PRC that it would 'not sit idly by' have created a rhetoric that opens the door to a future mobilisation of the PLA or PAP in Hong Kong. Considering that China wants to be seen as a responsible actor, the only real motivation for such a mobilisation would be continued and out of control protests. The recent actions by the PRC and Hong Kong legislatures provide ample reason for such protests. China has doubled the size of its contingent in Hong Kong, which notably now includes the PAP, which has been used in similar situations in Tibet and Xinjiang (the major difference lying in the fact that Hong Kong is a SAR). Mobilisation of these forces would, under the current rule of law, have to be requested by the Hong Kong government; a possible scenario, considering Carrie Lam's allegiance to the PRC and her comments on the HKPF being outnumbered.

Xia Baolong, vice chairman of a national political-advisory body and a former provincial leader, was appointed director of the Chinese government\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, according to a brief report published Thursday by China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency. The 67-year-old replaced Zhang Xiaoming, who was demoted to deputy director with responsibilities over day-to-day operations at the office, a ministerial-level agency that oversees governance in the two former colonies, according to Xinhua. The appointment of Mr. Xia, who has no experience in Hong Kong policy-making and is more than a decade older than his predecessor, comes just weeks after Beijing installed a new chief of its liaison office in the former British colony. It extends a shake-up in the Communist Party apparatus overseeing governance of Hong Kong, where anti-Beijing protests over the past eight months have posed a challenge to Mr. Xi\u2019s leadership and remains a source of concern even as a continuing coronavirus outbreak became the priority for China\u2019s leaders. Since mass protests erupted in Hong Kong in June, broadly targeting Beijing\u2019s growing influence over the semiautonomous city, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has been accused of underestimating the depth of public discontent that has fueled the unrest and led to a landslide defeat of pro-Beijing politicians at local district elections in November.\u201c"], [1333, "2020-02-11T19:18:16Z", [0.51], ""], [81394, "2020-02-11T04:39:16Z", [0.1], ""], [80213, "2020-02-11T00:49:56Z", [0.27], ""], [58648, "2020-02-10T17:01:11Z", [0.7], ""], [31275, "2020-02-10T15:43:11Z", [0.05], "Reversing.

Xi Jinping remembers well the results of armed forces being mobilized to quell demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and hopes to avoid that at all costs. Although the PAP has been successful with its operations in Xinjiang and Tibet its mobilization in a Special Administrative Region (SAR) such as HK would represent a more real and symbolic violation of its own \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy. China's economy is slowing and the PRC is currently scrambling to address its Coronavirus population. Damaging its reputation with HK, especially after it received support from the US President, might have disastrous blowback on its economy via trade. It still has to iron out trade deals with the US as well. There are many variables regarding the US general election this year, so any hasty moves that would cause President Trump to criticize China might manifest themselves for 4 more years (if he is re-elected in 2020).  Overall, there are too many variables that delay official PLA/PAP action being taken in HK. A slowing economy, waning protester activity heading into early 2020, the ramifications of the spreading coronavirus, and ongoing trade negotiations with the US greatly prevent the PRC from taking any harsh actions against HK in the near future.

There are no widespread reports of the local police being overwhelmed by protestor action and reinforcements being required. When unarmed PLA forces did leave their barracks to help with street clean up, the Hong Kong government condemned this action and said it did not ask for help.[2]  (A) would become more likely if the protests become more violent, meaning the police find them harder to resist and contain, or if the police force numbers decline due to individual officers leaving the force. This could occur due to public perception of the police being particularly low [3][4], which may affect morale. (B) would likely cause international outcry so is probably a last resort. There are a number of actions China could take first including infiltration of Hong Kong police force (some think this has already taken place) [3], pressuring Hong Kong businesses and government to support the police and enact legal injunctions against protestors [5] and shows of power, such as the maneuvers in Shenzhen.[6]  That said, certain political could increase the risk of B, such as any wavering by the Hong Kong government on the protestors\u2019 fifth demand (resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage)[7]. This situation would be considered extreme by China as it could lead to the start of true independence of Hong Kong, and a militaristic response becomes more likely, such as was seen in Catalonia when an independence referendum took place.[8] As of January 2020, neither A or B seem likely, in the near term, but the time horizon for this question is long.
