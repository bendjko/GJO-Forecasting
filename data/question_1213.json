More importantly however, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any progress on Cruz\u2019 concern about using 529s for homeschooling. To watch: do the supporters of the bill have the ability to offer something to Cruz and the other R Senators who are holding up the bill over the issue of using 529s for homeschooling?  Overall, while I think it\u2019s >50% that some version of this legislation will pass at some point this or next year given its general popularity and bipartisan appeal, there are many possibilities and timelines. The only chance for the bill to go through quickly within the timeframe of this question is for the Senate to follow unanimous consent procedure (which would require Cruz and the other dissenters to be convinced). Other possibilities include going through normal procedures involving debates and significant floor time. Or attaching it to another piece of legislation.

However, the Senate decided to forgo this length process.  Instead it opted for the \"unanimous consent\" approach in which the bill will be passed in the Senate if everybody agrees.  This would have speed up the passing of the bill significantly.  However, Ted Cruz objected (placed a hold on the bill) due to his disagreement with the 529 plan in the SECURE Act.   Cruz has been known to be a difficult person to work with, even with the Republicans.  In addition, it is reported that there are objections from other Senators but their identities are unknown.  How do you work on the objections if you don't even know whom to talk to? with the above in mind and the short time frame for the question, I forecast the probability of success of this bill to be below 50-50.

The president is expected to sign it according to lobbyists quoted by the WSJ. Therefore, this will likely be a matter of timing. The Senate will recess on August 5, so the bill would have to be passed before then. Therefore it will be important to watch developments in the next week or two to gauge whether it is on track to do so.
