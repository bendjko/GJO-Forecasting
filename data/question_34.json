It should be noted that it also appears that satellite uplink equipment is also being constructed on many of the features. What this allows is a more sophisticated and reliable over-the-horizon targeting capability for China\u2019s growing arsenal of anti-ship ballistic missiles, extending a more credible threat envelope of A2/AD coverage to moving targets\u2014like aircraft carrier strike groups.\nThe coordination of Chinese maritime assets in the South China Sea, such as naval militia, will also benefit from this increased domain awareness. These assets are being widely used by the Central Government in both the East and South China Sea. When combined with recent reports that China has begun to install satellite uplinks to its growing Beidou-GPS system throughout its fishing fleet\u2014and very likely throughout its maritime militia\u2014the ability for Beijing to make sure that these \u2018white hulls\u2019 are where they need to be at the most opportune time seems to be increasing.\nThese facilities might also allow the PLA to conduct active jamming of other electronic sensors and radars in the region. China already has a history of this activity in the South China Sea, with reports last year that attempts were being made to jam the on-board equipment and disrupt the GPS uplinks of American RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance aircraft.\" Comments: '......... to turn the screws when it feels the timing is right'.

Instead, China's South China Sea militrary buildup appears to be defensive in nature. In particular, its air defense systems now being installed are designed to protect against missile attacks on their claimed islands rather than for causing mass civilian casulaties by shooting down airliners.

And China is ready to deploy a new air defense system developed to knock incoming missiles out of the sky. The focus has shifted to anti-missile technology since Beijing now sees incoming missiles as more of a threat than hostile aircraft, experts say.

On Aug. 29, China's ambassador to the Philippines, Zhao Jinhua, announced that Beijing was willing to hold bilateral talks with Manila and would \"look into the possibility\" of allowing Filipino fishermen to fish in the disputed waters, particularly around the Scarborough Shoal. The ambassador's comments come in the wake of a series of meetings between Chinese and Philippine officials, as well as several instances of accommodating rhetoric from both sides. They also come nearly seven weeks after a landmark ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that invalidated China's sweeping claims over the South China Sea. Yet despite the ostensible victory for his country, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appears willing to temporarily set aside the court's decision to mend ties with China. To that end, Duterte has repeatedly called for talks between Manila and Beijing, and he has vowed not to raise the court's ruling at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in September. So far China has responded well to his outreach, particularly as it struggles to manage the fallout of the ruling elsewhere and rising tension with Japan in the East China Sea. Of course, this by no means indicates that detente will come at the expense of the Philippines' maritime sovereignty. Duterte has proved himself to be a savvy politician, and he is undoubtedly trying to use the upper hand Manila has gained to pursue better economic deals with China while continuing to cooperate with other powers, such as Japan and the United States. One of the key concessions the Philippines has discussed with China is a proposal for joint fishing around the Scarborough Shoal. Since China seized it in 2012, the shoal has lain at the center of the maritime dispute between Manila and Beijing, both because of its proximity to the Philippine mainland (about 120 nautical miles) and because of the repeated clashes between Chinese and Philippine fishermen in the waters around it. (China has attempted to block foreign fishermen from tapping into the shoal's waters, which are rich with fish.) When the international court ruled against Beijing's claim to the shoal, fears arose that China would retaliate somehow, prompting the United States to warn against further \"provocative action\" on Beijing's part.  Since China hopes to avoid inciting a U.S. military response, its strategy around the Scarborough Shoal has effectively run its course. For now, at least, this has created room for cooperation with the Philippines, as has Manila's own efforts to regulate the activities of its fishermen in the area. Of course, any deal between the two countries would depend on their continuing political will to abide by it and on how broader disputes over China's claims in the South China Sea play out. Though a deal on joint fishing may not necessarily lead to broader cooperation in the South China Sea, it would prevent one of the most heated aspects of the dispute from escalating.

While the United States and China have both taken steps in recent weeks seemingly designed to generate at least a modicum of de-escalation, most observers believe that the South China Sea issue will figure prominently on the U.S.-China agenda (as well as on the East Asian and Southeast Asian foreign policy agendas) for years, if not decades, to come; and indeed, some regard the South China Sea as a crucible for possible major international conflict and even world war (\u00b6 1).

Of course, rules and norms are important to provide a common set of guidelines for all actors, and hotlines are useful when crises break out (provided, of course, that the phones are actually answered, as previous instances in the U.S.-China relationship have demonstrated). But the fundamental challenge in the South China Sea has not been the shortage of rules or the absence of crisis management mechanisms, but the rise of a bolder, more assertive China that is so committed to changing the status quo in its favor that it is willing to break existing rules and risk a crisis in the process. In that sense, hotlines or codes of conduct are of limited utility unless they are accompanied by a change in Beijing\u2019s calculations and resulting approach. Sixth and finally, even if we end up seeing a few more \u2018breakthroughs\u2019 of this ilk as well in the coming months, we need to keep in mind that this might ultimately prove to once again be the relative calm before the storm. The items of agreement we have seen this week ought not to be divorced from the other worrying developments we have seen since the ruling, whether it be China\u2019s stated unwillingness to abide by the ruling or its destabilizing actions including joint drills with Russia, an increased naval presence near Scarborough Shoal, and moves to militarize the Spratly Islands. Indeed, we should not be surprised if we see Beijing tout its cooperation with ASEAN but then continue with its South China Sea assertiveness and even ultimately cross what Washington has clearly indicated are red lines \u2013 such as reclamation on Scarborough Shoal or declaring an air defense identification zone \u2013 following the G-20 meeting or even after the U.S. presidential elections in November. China has demonstrated time and time again that it is comfortable alternating bouts of charm with periods of coercion, and it may well do so once more.\"\nhttp://asiamaritime.net/beware-the-illusion-of-china-asean-south-china-sea-breakthroughs/"], [1708, "2016-08-18T00:42:21Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2016-08-17T21:52:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-17T21:47:21Z", [0.16], ""], [1262, "2016-08-17T14:25:55Z", [0.81], "Increasing based in part on comments from @Raahul_Kumar.

The stationing of fighters could be used to enforce the zone. The RAAF routinely flies patrols over the South China Sea, meaning its planes would need to challenge China were any zone declared.The latest pictures, published by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, show that Beijing is building hangars for 24 fighter planes as well as up to four larger planes, such as aerial refuellers on each of three built-up reefs in the Spratly island archipelago.

But the work is far from over, as to reach a more sustainable debt ratio the Chinese banking sector will still require up to 2 trillion yuan of additional capital as well as the disposal of 4.5 trillion yuan worth of bad loans, according to the Swiss bank's estimates (\u00b6 1).

That\u2019s faster than the increase in the U.S. and U.K. in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The problem could be bigger still because the frantic pace of new lending makes it hard to know how many loans aren't being repaid. Regulatory loopholes, banks' off-balance-sheet portfolios of wealth management products (likened by some to Western lenders' exposures in the subprime crisis), and widespread shadow banking practices further complicate the picture \u2014 as does a system of implicit guarantees that obscures how much of the debt is backed by the government or who would be allowed to go bust. Local and provincial governments have borrowed about $4 trillion\u2014the size of Germany's economy\u2014and some used shorter-term, off-balance-sheet borrowing to fund dubious infrastructure and real estate projects. Chinese authorities are gradually allowing more defaults, which is driving up financing costs for companies. Banks have begun exchanging high-interest loans to local governments for low-cost bonds in a state-backed swap program that may expand to 15 trillion yuan ($2.3 trillion). The debt splurge continues: Borrowing by 29 of China's 31 provinces skyrocketed 53 percent in just two years through the end of 2015. And $1 trillion of new credit was granted in the first three months of 2016, much of it flowing into a resurgent property market. But there are signs the government may no longer tolerate spiraling debt: A prominent Communist Party newspaper declared in May that high leverage was China\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d and the country could not borrow its way to long-term economic health (\u00b6 2).

An ADIZ, which would effectively broaden Chinese airspace and impose restrictions on aircraft flying through the zone, would be the latest in a string of assertive moves that would strengthen Chinese sovereignty over the area. But asked what China should and should not do in the South China Sea, Wu Sichun, head of the influential National Institute for South China Sea Studies in China, told an audience at a think tank conference in Washington, D.C. that Beijing should try not to unilaterally declare an ADIZ. Wu suggested that not doing so would be one way for China to signal restraint and reduce tensions in the South China Sea (\u00b6 1-3). Author Almond, (2016) states that:\nRegardless of prior precedent, China may propose to amend customary international law in relation to ADIZ by creating a new \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d in the SCS. The declaration of an ADIZ could lead to the material enforcement of China\u2019s assertion of \u201cundisputed sovereignty\u201d and \u201crelated rights and jurisdiction\u201d in nearly all of the SCS. For example, the most extreme scenario would be if the ADIZ encompassed the entirety of Beijing\u2019s \u201cdashed-line\u201d claim encircling the island waters of the SCS, an area equal to about 22 percent of China\u2019s existing land territory and the vast majority of airspace in the SCS. Beijing may feel compelled to align the ADIZ with the dashed-line map in order to preserve, or at least not undermine, its claim. Note that the breadth and logic of this potential action would extend beyond past Chinese attempts to invoke security rights in the airspace above the EEZ in the SCS (e.g., the EP-3 incident of April 1, 2001) or the establishment of an ADIZ above the East China Sea (where China at least mimicked identification and control rules associated with extraterritorial ADIZs). A state\u2019s legal ability to administer and use force to secure its sovereign territory and accompanying airspace is much broader than the right to self-defense in international airspace or within an ADIZ (\u00b6 10-11).

Foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met for the first time since the U.N.-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration handed an emphatic legal victory to the Philippines in the dispute this month (Newsweek, 2016). The ruling by the court in The Hague denied China's sweeping claims in the strategic seaway, through which more than $5 trillion in global trade passes each year (Newsweek, 2016). Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters after the emergency meeting that South China Sea was not discussed at all. He, however, said ASEAN will issue the joint statement after all, but refused to say if the communique will contain a reference to South China Sea and China (Joshi & Malloy, 2016). \n\"You will read it,\" he said cryptically. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi also said: \"It's very positive ... We are very much on track\" to release the communique. She also would not say if the communique would refer to the South China Sea, or the decision of an international tribunal, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, earlier this month that said China's expansive claims in the region are illegal (Joshi & Malloy, 2016). The stalemate puts pressure on ASEAN's cherished unity and also gives an upper hand to China, which has used every diplomatic means at its disposal to stave off wider international criticism over moves it's made in the South China Sea that have impacted the four Southeast Asian countries (Joshi & Malloy, 2016).

All sorts of illogical, stupid things are done because of ego and \"politics\", as numerous post mortems on the invasion of Iraq have revealed. So far, it has seemed to me that the arguments presented in the discussion of the question about China declaring an ADIZ in the South China Sea have hinged on facts and logic, especially as seen from outside China. But what about emotion?  What about domestic politics?  Is there anything going on in China that might make Xi consider declaring an ADIZ as a distraction?   How is our behavior in the SCS impacting China and its leadership?  Might they be goaded by us into declaring an ADIZ that they can't defend?  If the UNCLOS ruling is adverse to China's interests, how might China react?  What might it need to do for domestic reasons to counter an adverse ruling on the Nine Dash Line? I agree that the facts & logic may not yet support the declaration of an ADIZ, but I think we need to look at other considerations.

It has been basically unenforceable and has led to a series of unpleasant public relations disasters for China.  Not the least of which is breathing new life into a U.S.-centric containment policy amongst many of China's neighbors.  \nPremise 2 - China does not need to declare such a status, as they can instead act in practice like it exists anyway.  \nPremise 3-Slow and steady build-up and pressure has been a good strategy for China, so why rush, especially given premise 2.   Now if I am wrong about any of these presumptions, I will likely miss on this one.  But what makes this question especially hard for me are the conditions around Premise 3.  Maybe China thinks it's time to put on the big-boy pants and formalize things, in order to be more assertive in its claims.  We know they are threatening, and the media seems to believe them.  And the U.S. has been pressuring them, so a counter-move would be reasonably plausible.  But does that mean they will really do it relatively soon?  I am inclined to say no, as I believe they will just ignore the court ruling and continue to solidify their hold of the area by doing things like militarizing their fishing fleet and beefing up their \"coast guard.\"   This question is a bit like the THAAD question to me.  Do I think that China will eventually formalize its claims (by ADIZ or some other means) in the South China Sea?  Absolutely.  But will it be within the term of this question.  I think not, but would not go to 90% without definitive proof.

The drills, announced in a brief online statement Sunday, are scheduled to stretch over seven days starting Tuesday and ending July 11, the day before the United Nations-backed tribunal in The Hague is expected to issue its ruling.

Noting specifically Chinas\u2019 ill-defined nine-dashed line claim for example which if one views from an objective point of reference; exists out-of-touch with the reality of global/international legal concepts. Noting the current international dispute in Philippines v China under scrutiny at The Hague, currently at the UN arbitration court will most likely side the Philippines (Panda, 2016). First viewing the map China, entitlements reach into the internationally established contiguous zone of all contesting neighboring countries. While the UN normally under its Convention on the Law of the Sea, grants countries exclusive economic zones which reach out to 370 kilometers, or 200 nautical miles, off their coasts, less than what China\u2019s claiming. One might take into consideration in this specific case, that other nations have the same rights, and China and each specific nations cannot exists granted space to the shores of their neighbors (NOAA, 2016).  Nevertheless, enough space to grant each independent nations with open seas a 200 nautical mile economic zones does not work out mathematically in the South China Seas. Therefore, an equal divide will eventually take place with the UN to resolve the dispute at some point in time, as will the creation of China\u2019s ADIZ. Back on point, freedom to navigate the contiguous zones, i.e. 12 to 24 nm all ships inclusive of warships, exist capable of entering within waters of other nations, under the U.N., Convention on the Law of the Sea. China although exists currently seeking to limit this internationally accepted rule of the sea, thus overstepping their legal claims in the South China Seas on multiple fronts (Harding, 2016). The United States has and will challenge this practice; inclusive of flyovers, in the South China Sea. China knows to establish an ADIZ and implement a design would mean drawing a line over what China thinks exists as its own territory. So over the entirety of the current disputed nine-dashed line claim or just over part of it? If so, where and why as well, would China exists willing to create an international incident to enforce their subjective ADIZ (Panda, 2016)? Author Panda, (2016) states that: \u201cThe United States\u2019 top diplomat issued a sharp warning to China. Speaking in Mongolia on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warning that the United States would treat a Chinese ADIZ over the South China Sea as a \u201cprovocative and destabilizing act\u201d (\u00b6 1). China\u2019s actions on the ADIZ seem to exists to deter the current United States push to continue on with surveillance flights and freedom of navigation patrols, all activities that Beijing understands to stand as \u201cmilitarization\u201d of the South China Sea (Panda, 2016). Giving the broadly expected advantageous result for Manila in Philippines v. China will endure as a \u201closs-of-face\u201d for Beijing; as well acknowledging the widespread expected noncompliance with its South China Sea ADIZ would also exists doubly so. In a collective society saving face exists paramount to China\u2019s international reputation thus they will avoid notoriety. While Beijing and Washington both seem to exist already playing games intent of signaling with specific goals of deterring each other\u2019s perceived objectionable behavior (Panda, 2016).

They have also landed a military jet on Fiery Cross Reef and deployed advanced fighters and surface-to-air missiles on Woody Island in the Paracels. Taken together, these capabilities provide forward-positioned power projection platforms for Chinese fighters, bombers, and reconnaissance aircraft.

The Chinese flotilla, which will include two warships and a hospital ship, will participate in live fire, anti-piracy, search and rescue and other drills. The annual exercises involve dozens of countries and are held every two years in and around Hawaii. China\u2019s participation comes despite growing maritime tension with Washington, particularly over the South China Sea. China also took part in the 2014 joint drills with more than 20 other countries, though its participation was limited to areas such as humanitarian relief and search and rescue operations. Even with tensions high between great powers in the Pacific Rim, military ties between Washington and Beijing are at their strongest since the end of the Cold War\" all these events have occurred since June 1, 2017\nsomething is clearly up: re ADIZ, Thaad, and UNCLOS by July 1 and this does not impact \"lethal confrontation\".\nThose exercises end about July 1, 2016.\nChina announced but did not enforce the East Asia ADIZ\nsame here.\nbut after June 30, there are still 3 months to flip.

Bottom line 1: China will never accept the arbitration on the South China Sea no matter what kind of ruling the International Tribunal makes. Although the International Tribunal may make an official ruling in the coming weeks, both China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of National Defense stressed on Thursday that China will neither accept nor recognize the adjudication.\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministry has said that the choice of the Philippines to unilaterally initiate arbitration was little more than political provocation. The Philippines does not actually aim to settle the dispute this way; instead, they are attempting to deny China's territorial sovereignty and maritime interests. Bottom line 2: The U.S. should stop close-in reconnaissance. In recent years, U.S. military ships and aircraft have frequently conducted reconnaissance in China's coastal areas. These operations seriously threaten China's air and maritime security. According to China's Defense Ministry, a U.S. reconnaissance plane EP-3 flew close to the airspace of China's Hainan Island on May 17. Two Chinese military aircraft conducted identification and verification in accordance with relevant regulations. It is not difficult to tell who is actually challenging the region's stability. Yang Yujun, spokesperson of China's Ministry of National Defense, said, \"We urge [interfering countries] to stop sowing seeds of discord so as to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, which is in the common interest of all parties.\" Bottom line 3: The South China Sea disputes are not the business of G7 and its members. Informed that Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said on Thursday that G7 should make a clear statement on the South China Sea disputes, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that some countries are trying to take advantage of the summit. The South China Sea issue is none of the business of G7 and its members. Hua urged those participating in G7 to refocus and refrain from poking their noses into matters beyond their authority.  Bottom line 4: Any attempt to undermine China's sovereign rights through intimidation or other means is doomed to fail. At a press conference on May 25, Hua Chunying said that China is in the right when it comes to upholding territorial sovereignty and preserving its legitimate rights in the South China Sea. Many members of the international community support China's position on the disputes. \"It is ridiculous to accuse China of attempting to seek regional hegemony,\" said Tayeb Abdul Rahim, general secretary of the Palestinian Authority's executive committee, in an interview recently.\nHua explained that many Western media reports have falsely stated that the countries who back China on the South China Sea issue are small, poor and inconsequential. This statement is blatantly arrogant, prejudiced and snobbish. Hua emphasized that it is preposterous to dismiss the legitimate stance of a country based on its size and wealth. The truth is, many different countries sympathize with and endorse China's position on the issue. http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2016/05/mil-160527-pdo01.htm?_m=3n%2e002a%2e1729%2elo0ao02gx5%2e1l86"], [876, "2016-05-31T11:32:55Z", [0.8], ""], [691, "2016-05-31T11:27:32Z", [0.52], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-china-usa-idUSKCN0YM0U5\nStaying above 50 on this one, but I'm not sure why.

The so-called freedom of navigation operation was undertaken to \"challenge excessive maritime claims\" by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam which were seeking to restrict navigation rights in the South China Sea, Urban said. \"These excessive maritime claims are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention in that they purport to restrict the navigation rights that the United States and all states are entitled to exercise,\" Urban said in an emailed statement.\n....\nChina's Defence Ministry said two fighter jets were scrambled and three warships shadowed the U.S. ship, telling it to leave. The U.S. patrol \"again proves that China's construction of defensive facilities on the relevant reefs in the Nansha Islands is completely reasonable and totally necessary\", it said, using China's name for the Spratly Islands where much of its reclamation work is taking place. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the U.S. ship illegally entered Chinese waters. \"This action by the U.S. side threatened China's sovereignty and security interests, endangered the staff and facilities on the reef, and damaged regional peace and stability,\" he told a daily news briefing.\n....\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/u-conducts-freedom-navigation-operation-south-china-sea-052908352.html?ref=gs"], [3225, "2016-05-10T10:44:31Z", [0.8], "Up a bit on today's news of a new Freedom of Navigation exercise by the US."], [691, "2016-05-10T10:08:51Z", [0.55], ""], [51, "2016-05-10T02:01:17Z", [0.45], ""], [368, "2016-05-09T20:09:35Z", [0.65], ""], [12302, "2016-05-09T16:09:36Z", [0.23], ""], [4634, "2016-05-09T13:49:52Z", [0.52], ""], [10759, "2016-05-09T13:49:35Z", [0.52], ""], [691, "2016-05-09T11:27:17Z", [0.56], ""], [14208, "2016-05-08T22:34:06Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Oct 22, 2016 06:55PM UTC"], [755, "2016-05-08T19:46:11Z", [0.7], "The Australian, May 9, 'China dismisses verdict over Scarborough Shoal in South China Sea': http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/china-dismisses-verdict-over-scarborough-shoal-in-south-china-sea/news-story/aad442d33afc137992e71a1a821595f5\nClip from article:\n\"Mr Ouyang said at the weekend that no arbitration verdict would change history or the fact that China is sovereign over the South China Sea islands and their surrounding waters.

Personally, the most compelling idea has been eventually China and the international community are going to accept \"if it looks like, sounds like and walks like a duck, it is a duck.\" All the pieces are in place for an ADIZ in the SCS. No, not enough (yet) to effectively and enduringly cover the entire territory within the 9- claim, but that's not what this IFP asks about. The Hague ruling has been a potential trigger since China refused to represent their own side, so I also don't want to weigh that too heavily simply because the ruling is nearer on the calendar, we've always known that China won't agree with a ruling that doesn't legitimize their claim; though, the adiz pieces are better placed now than they were, say, a year ago.

I've also not been as persuaded as others by the oft repeated argument of China being reluctant to 'humiliate' themselves again as they allegedly did in the ECS. China doesn't have to shoot down a plane that trespasses the SCS ADIZ non-compliantly. There are an infinite number of creative responses the Chinese could have that don't require the risk of WW3 or other extremely low probability outcomes, but which would still 'save face', or at the very least maintain a domestic image of more tiger than paper; responses that also would find themselves deliberated in an international bureaucratic system that doesn't really have 'swiftly responds' as part of its resume.

Earlier this month, Manila agreed to give US forces access to five military bases, including some close to the disputed South China Sea, where tensions have risen over Beijing's assertion of its territorial claims. China claims virtually all the South China Sea despite conflicting claims by Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines, and has built up artificial islands in the area in recent months, including some with airstrips. Washington has since October carried out two high-profile \"freedom of navigation\" operations in which it sailed warships within 12 nautical miles of islets claimed by China. Asked about a recent report on US patrols in the sea, defense ministry spokesman Yang Yujun told a briefing on Thursday: \"As for the US ships which came, I can only suggest they be careful\". The agreement between Washington and Manila applies to the Antonio Bautista Air Base on the western island of Palawan, directly on the South China Sea. Asked about the deal, Yang said: \"To strengthen military alliances is a reflection of a Cold War mentality\". \"It is in the opposite direction of the trends of the era for peace, development and cooperation,\" he said, adding bilateral military cooperation \"should not \"undermine a third party's interests\". Washington regularly accuses Beijing -- which says it has built runways on and deployed unspecified weapons to islands in the South China Sea -- of militarizing the area. Beijing denies the accusations and says US patrols have ramped up tensions. \"Now, the United States has come back, and is reinforcing its military presence in this region and promoting militarisation in the South China Sea,\" Yang said. Beijing acknowledges that the facilities on its new islands will have military as well as civilian purposes. China's comments came as Malaysia accused \"a large number\" of Chinese fishing trawlers and a coast guard vessel of entering its waters, understood to be last week.

All but the formal announcement have occurred and the event may have occurred. NO reason to mark down today even for passage of time. Lets look at when PRC declared ADIZ  in East China Sea  back in 2013.\n\"\"Matt Gertken: Hi, I'm Matt Gertken, East Asia analyst with Stratfor, and I'm here with Paul Floyd, military analyst with Stratfor. We've been discussing the controversy surrounding China's establishment of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea. China's ADIZ overlaps with those of Japan and South Korea, and that has generated controversy, especially with Japan, because of territories that they dispute. But we've also seen a response by the South Koreans, who have come out with a tweak to their own ADIZ, saying in particular that they want to be sure and regulate this space over some of their islands that fall under the new Chinese zone. Paul what about these ADIZs? How do you define them, and how do you think that they are regulated, and in particular China its ability to regulate and implement this new zone? Paul Floyd: So, it's normal for country to have an ADIZ. It basically allows a country to have some standoff space from its actual territorial airspace and its own territory for incoming aircraft, where it can separate civilian aircraft from military aircraft and especially identify ideally aircraft that can be a threat. So many countries have them. The unique part of this one is the unilateral nature of China establishing one really without talking to anybody and doing it overlapping Taiwan, Japan and South Korea's \u2014 significantly over Japan's established ADIZ. And so, enforcement of these implies two basic pillars, the first being able to monitor that airspace. That basically requires radars that can be on ground-based, ship-based or on air platforms. Those have to kind of be dispersed evenly throughout the region and then once you can see something and identify it from there, ideally you would then have force \u2014 i.e. planes, other ships, land-based missile systems that can defend that airspace if need be. It's the ability to see it and the ability to use that force to actually control the ADIZ if necessary. Matt: So one of the things I find interesting then is the fact that if the Chinese approach this, they know they needed to gain greater capability and in particular coordinate and comprehensively be able to use those capabilities. But they've declared this zone ahead of that time. So essentially, it looks almost like them just re-declaring their intention eventually to gain control over the space and in particular by including the disputed territories and Japan, signal in essence that they're not compromising on the territorial conflict that at some point in the future they do intend to make those sovereign territories. That to me kind of puts China in an interesting position because they've said they're going to do this, they're rapidly approaching the ability to do it, at the east in the coming years, but in the interim you have the states surrounding them recognizing China's intentions and preparing in ways that involve a little bit more coordination between those powers than is often the case. In particular with South Korea now extending their age ADIZ, one of the possibilities is that that would reignite controversies between Japan and South Korea, and yet the Japanese have come out instantly and said that, we're happy with the South Korean decision. Obviously they're going to continue to monitor it, and there could be a friction in the future. But at the moment the Japanese are very much letting the South Koreans make their adjustments and not raising any red flags. So it seems that China, if not getting ahead of itself, because it's late in establishing its ADIZ compared to these, but it has kind of been an awful lot to chew.\nMatt: So if we fast forward to a time when China is able to do that. Are we then looking at an environment where the Japanese are constantly intercepted their aircraft when they're going to Japanese controlled islands? Or is it is a more a question of whether China really which would choose to escalate to that extent? Paul: Great way to put that. An ADIZ is just a line on a map, and really a lot of it has to do with how you choose to enforce it. You can easily make this a de facto norm where on paper these two zones overlap but both countries, the military's or whatever units are responding to the region, kind of learn how to work with each other. And it can be kind of a very easy thing, where they basically we have pilots waving at each other and it's okay and there's no sense of hostility necessarily. This can also go in the exact opposite way, where you know, China feels threatened, feels aggressive, has a nationalist kind of impulse, and some of its units get very aggressive with Japanese aircraft. And so the potential for accident that can then escalate to something else is there.  So I would say it increases the chances for accidents and unforeseen incidents, but it's not necessarily, you know a direct challenge or provocation in a military sense right now. So you know I think this is a lot more about kind of re-establishing the bureaucratic role of how Japan and South Korea and Taiwan and China all interplay over territory, and kind of de facto change in a reality ideally if the U.S. and other countries kind of just accept and let civilian aircraft, for example continue just to say, yes it's there, we respond to the rules and therefore that kind of gives it some permanence, some actual legitimacy over time.\nMatt: Yeah. The interesting thing there is that the ADIZ controversy then just becomes one part in the overall distrust between these players, in particular Japan and China. Because while we would like to see them develop a new status quo, and I think they will to an extent, I don't think they're going to be you know shooting down each other's planes any time and soon. But at the same time, you do have that fundamental tendency to want to push the envelope, test the other's response, and you've now basically seen the Chinese say that they're going to extend their ability to do that and their willingness to do that. So just like we've seen with fishing ships, where they tend to ram into each other and cause conflict, and then that shifted more into coastal authorities and other maritime surveillance and other authorities. There could be a situation here where a lot of games of chicken are being played and that's seems to heighten the overall level of risk in the region\". https://www.stratfor.com/video/conversation-analyzing-chinas-ability-enforce-new-adiz   (12-9-2014)\n\nI like the analysis here by commenters alot more than Stratfor but I certainly understand my limitations\nThere is a de facto ADIZ now in the South China Sea March 2015 \n Stratfor analsyts  discussed the analagous situation in the North.

If there is a potential trigger then No reaction from China: 5%\nADIZ: 28% \nOther than ADIZ reaction: 71% No international trigger: 9% China didn't really gain much from East China Sea ADIZ apart from laying a claim, at least seen externally.

Their previous decision seemed to have come in response to the AirSea Battle Doctrine (renamed the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons), where the Navy and the Air Force worked together on plans to enable the U.S. government to be able to defeat adversaries who had the capability of denying the U.S. access to a certain region of their territory. This is most certainly the case with China as the U.S. has put a lot of stock into enabling free travel within the waterways around China for sailors of all backgrounds, inherently allowing the U.S. a greater chance of navigating these regions in order to properly prepare for a conflict. However, China claims that this act was in order to create newfound sovereignty in the East China Sea, as they lacked any control over the Diaoyu Islands, a characteristic that is not shared with the South China Sea. However, they have no way that they can attribute this decision to sovereignty for the South China Sea as Beijing has nearly full control over all of the maritime enterprises in the South China Sea. In fact, instead of showing a desire for sovereignty, it would just weaken the great relations China has with the countries in Southeast Asia due to border conflicts regarding the edge of the ADIZ in relationship to the island provinces that China and its neighbors currently control. Because of how these islands lie within the South China Sea, making a fair border is quite the challenging task as many of the islands are within a very close vicinity of islands belonging to other countries. Lastly, most analysts within China agree that the formulation of an Air-Defense Identification Zone wouldn't do anything productive for China, and could just serve as a way to aggravate those countries around them. On the flip side, there is still very much so a chance of the initiation of an ADIZ over the South China Sea if China decides they still want to attempt to repel the United States who has been increasing naval presence in the South China Sea (http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chinas-east-china-sea-adiz-gamble-past-present-south-china-13150).

In the hope of reducing this gulf, here are some facts about ADIZs. 1. There are no international agreements governing any aspect of an ADIZ. States are neither explicitly authorized to establish them nor are they explicitly prohibited from doing so. ADIZs usually extend into what is universally acknowledged to be international airspace, even by the countries that maintain them, and in no way confer any sovereign rights. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2013-12-09/whats-adiz 2. The central distinction between China\u2019s ADIZ and that of other countries, like the United States, is that China requires all planes that enter the ADIZ to notify China in advance, even if they do not plan to land at a Chinese airport. The ADIZs of the United States, for example, only require advanced notification of those planes planning to land. http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/chinas-puzzling-adiz-decision-making/ 3. The proposed (by commentators, not China) South China Sea ADIZ would cover a region through which aircraft of many nations fly. 4. Official rules for U.S. and Canadian ADIZs. https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/library/documents/2011/Jan/49877/ADIZ%20TFR%20Intercepts%20w%20answers.pdf 5. U.S. and Japanese military aircraft have routinely defied the South China Sea ADIZ. See several of my previous forecasts for links to news stories. 6. The three ways to enforce an ADIZ are diplomacy, harassment of intruding aircraft sufficiently well as to drive them back \u2013 requires that the defender has better fighters than the intruders \u2013 or, that failing, destruction of intruders. During the Cold War, these activities between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are rumored to have caused classified fatalities and known to have cause unclassified fatalities.

Right after China's release of the East China Sea ADIZ notice to airmen (NOTAM),  some nations either encouraged or required its civil aviators to ignore the ADIZ. Ever since then, China has done  nothing about these huge numbers of civil aviators violating this ADIZ.

Assad ignored the threat, used the weapons, Obama did nothing. Did Obama then draw any new \"red lines\"? Nope. IMNSHO, same with China. Ever since declaring that ADIZ, airliners, fighter planes, spy planes, probably even old lady piloted planes have been ignoring the ADIZ and China has done: nothing. The most China was able to achieve was to get Japan and the U.S. to agree to a mutual pact  to persuade their respective pilots to stop making rude gestures when in visual range of each other, and to refrain from radioing trash talk.

In time they can enforce it militarily, and in the meantime who is going to remove, blockade or otherwise prevent their island(s) buildup? China doesn't have to dominate the US and Japan militarily before the ADIZ is useful. This isn't about domination through war - China knows Japan and the US will not attack or blockade any of its disputed islands.

Regarding many forecasters' decreasing their probabilities based on the 'passage of time': is that because you don't believe the SCS ADIZ is a certainty at all, or you just don't believe 8.5 months is enough to see this occur? The ECS ADIZ was established (ostensibly) within a months 'notice'. Meanwhile, we've been hawking this SCS ADIZ issue for at least two years now.

What is your comment? A: China has finished building a new airport on Yongshu Jiao of China\u2019s Nansha Islands. The Chinese government conducted a test flight to the airport with a civil aircraft in order to test whether or not the facilities on it meet the standards for civil aviation. Relevant activity falls completely within China\u2019s sovereignty.  China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their adjacent waters. The Chinese side will not accept the unfounded accusation from the Vietnamese side.  China-Vietnam relations, on the whole, are riding a momentum of development. It is hoped that the Vietnamese side can work with China towards the same direction and make concrete efforts to sustain the sound and stable growth of bilateral ties.\n____\nA rundown of 2015 and challenges for 2016:\nhttp://tuoitrenews.vn/politics/32545/rough-waters-ahead-the-east-vietnam-sea-in-2016\n____\nThe disputed plan to shift the US base in Okinawa is in the news and likely viewed as a weakness to exploit with naval and air provocations by China.

That\u2019s despite initial warnings the military might use force against planes that failed to follow rules, including the requirement to file flight plans.\n... The initial announcement of the ADIZ brought some confusion. While the rules were supposed to apply to all aircraft entering the area, the Defense Ministry later said commercial flights by foreign airlines would not be affected. Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways don\u2019t report flight plans to China and haven\u2019t done so for almost two years.

In the hope of reducing this gulf, here are some facts about ADIZs. 1. There are no international agreements governing any aspect of an ADIZ. States are neither explicitly authorized to establish them nor are they explicitly prohibited from doing so. ADIZs usually extend into what is universally acknowledged to be international airspace, even by the countries that maintain them, and in no way confer any sovereign rights. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2013-12-09/whats-adiz 2. The central distinction between China\u2019s ADIZ and that of other countries, like the United States, is that China requires all planes that enter the ADIZ to notify China in advance, even if they do not plan to land at a Chinese airport. The ADIZs of the United States, for example, only require advanced notification of those planes planning to land. http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/chinas-puzzling-adiz-decision-making/ 3. The proposed (by commentators, not China) South China Sea ADIZ would cover a region through which aircraft of many nations fly. 4.

U.S. and Japanese military aircraft have routinely defied the South China Sea ADIZ. See several of my previous forecasts for links to news stories. 6. The three ways to enforce an ADIZ are diplomacy, harassment of intruding aircraft sufficiently well as to drive them back \u2013 requires that the defender has better fighters than the intruders \u2013 or, that failing, destruction of intruders. During the Cold War, these activities between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are rumored to have caused classified fatalities and known to have cause unclassified fatalities.

Taking both these things into consideration (also in light of the USS Lassen's Passage near to Fiery Cross Reef's Chinese runway project), I suspect that China will not create a new ADIZ in the region without being dramatically provoked by other claimants, the probability of which I expect to also be low. Starting with the second part first, the shape could correspond closely to the Exclusive Economic Zone or it could extend to cover all or part of the 9-Dotted Line to encompass all or part of the Spratly Islands. A conservative ADIZ is unlikely because it would appear to be a smaller region than claimed as their rightful territory, thereby locking in a loss. A larger territory would therefore be the preferred option. However, the chances of a new Chinese ADIZ in this region are low due to the military postures of the rival countries in this area (Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and The Philippines), compared to Taiwan, Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea disputes. The East China Sea disputes revolve around locations over which other countries actively exercise possession: the Senkaku Islands (Japan) and Socotra Rock (South Korea), requiring China to escalate matters in order to force a resolution in their favor. However, the situation in the Spratly's is somewhat reversed, with China directly and indirectly (via Taiwan) possessing key locations, which puts the onus on other actors to provoke them to force a change. The distance and widely scattered nature of the Spratly Islands also somewhat diffuses tensions. The US may appear to provoke the Chinese to influence the US election cycle, but the preferred result for both China and the current party of the US executive is a benign display of US power projection followed by a Chinese display of mild annoyance tempered with infinite patience."], [368, "2015-10-28T19:29:55Z", [0.0], ""], [532, "2015-10-28T19:03:22Z", [0.35], ""], [131, "2015-10-28T17:30:19Z", [0.25], "I gave this a little more thought and I'm revising upwards again - according to the NYT article, the administration seems reluctant to make a big deal out of the sail-by... it really seems like they don't want this to escalate.

This aligns with previous Chinese statements on the purpose of construction in the South China Sea: mainly for civilian purposes, but with the acknowledged goal of \u201cbetter safeguarding [China\u2019s] territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.\u201d \"A reporter asked Hua to clarify her statements that China will have military facilities in the Spratlys but claims to be not militarizing the islands. Hua replied crossly, \u201cI wonder how you understand the word \u2018militarize\u2019\u201d \u2013 which is indeed the crucial issue. According to Hua, China\u2019s construction of defensive military facilities does not qualify as militarization; however, the line between defensive and offensive capabilities is blurred (see also: the debate over THAAD missile defense deployment in South Korea). For example, neighboring countries believe the deployment of Chinese radar facilities in the South China Sea would be a step toward militarization as this capability could be put to use in enforcing an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over disputed regions. China, however, could plausibly claim that the radar is a defensive asset only \u2013 and thus deny claims that it is going back on Xi\u2019s promise not the militarize the islands. \"Importantly, Hua\u2019s remarks show how China is going to play the rhetorical game when it comes to accusations that China is militarizing the region.  According to Hua, the South China Sea is already being militarized by \u201chigh-profile display of military strength and frequent and large-scale military drills by certain countries and their allies in the South China Sea\u201d \u2013 meaning the United States and its partners. China\u2019s construction of military facilities, Hua argued, is a necessary response to those provocative moves. \u201cIt is easy to understand why the Chinese side has to deploy some military facilities on relevant islands and reefs,\u201d Hua said. \"With the United States moving closer to conducting freedom of navigation operations within 12 nautical miles of certain Chinese-held artificial features, analysts are already predicting that China could use such a move to justify scaling up its military assets on the disputed features.

In the hope of reducing this gulf, here are some facts about ADIZs. 1. There are no international agreements governing any aspect of an ADIZ. States are neither explicitly authorized to establish them nor are they explicitly prohibited from doing so. ADIZs usually extend into what is universally acknowledged to be international airspace, even by the countries that maintain them, and in no way confer any sovereign rights. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2013-12-09/whats-adiz 2. The central distinction between China\u2019s ADIZ and that of other countries, like the United States, is that China requires all planes that enter the ADIZ to notify China in advance, even if they do not plan to land at a Chinese airport. The ADIZs of the United States, for example, only require advanced notification of those planes planning to land. http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/chinas-puzzling-adiz-decision-making/ 3. The proposed (by commentators, not China) South China Sea ADIZ would cover a region through which aircraft of many nations fly. 4.

U.S. and Japanese military aircraft have routinely defied the South China Sea ADIZ. See several of my previous forecasts for links to news stories. 6. The three ways to enforce an ADIZ are diplomacy, harassment of intruding aircraft sufficiently well as to drive them back \u2013 requires that the defender has better fighters than the intruders \u2013 or, that failing, destruction of intruders. During the Cold War, these activities between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are rumored to have caused classified fatalities and known to have cause unclassified fatalities.

I have noted that many forecasters have struggled with this question as it regards defensibility of an ADIZ in the South China Sea based upon frequent violations of the East China Sea ADIZ.

It is an old article but a good one: http://www.dw.com/en/chinese-defense-zone-its-symbolic-politics/a-17287389 Pertinent portion of the interview: (this article refers to the establishment of the East China Sea ADIZ)  How significant are China's and South Korea's moves to establish and enlarge their respective air defense zones? The main purpose of these zones is not air defense, but rather symbolic politics. These countries want to underscore their territorial claims to certain islands located within the ADIZ. But these claims cannot be justified under international law by simply declaring an ADIZ. These countries are rather sending the political signal: \"We are entitled to these islands.\" This holds very true with regards the construction of the islands in the South China Sea. Additional readings that might be useful: http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/mandate-of-heaven-an-adiz-in-the-south-china-sea/ Pertinent portions:\n\"Regardless of prior precedent, China may propose to amend customary international law in relation to ADIZ by creating a new \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d in the SCS. The declaration of an ADIZ could lead to the material enforcement of China\u2019s assertion of \u201cundisputed sovereignty\u201d and \u201crelated rights and jurisdiction\u201d in nearly all of the SCS. For example, the most extreme scenario would be if the ADIZ encompassed the entirety of Beijing\u2019s \u201cdashed-line\u201d claim encircling the island waters of the SCS, an area equal to about 22 percent of China\u2019s existing land territory and the vast majority of airspace in the SCS. Beijing may feel compelled to align the ADIZ with the dashed-line map in order to preserve, or at least not undermine, its claim.\" OTOH, this would greatly amplify the current disputes in the South China Sea, and China has repeatedly commented that it is seeking friendly relations with its ASEAN neighbors. There is a significant re-engagement of the US in this part of the world, with increasing military cooperation between China's neighbors.  The US is contemplating a much more muscular presence in the area and is likely intent on challenging the 12 mile zone around these islands in the near term.  And practically speaking, most air armament nowadays has significant standoff capability, and thus an ADIZ's defensive purpose would be limited in any case. But at the end of the day, consider that the primary consideration for the establishment of an ADIZ may only have a political purpose, that being to formally state (if only unilaterally) that there exists a dispute regarding the sovereignty of certain areas and features within the South China Sea.

I asked my in-house expert and he said such an extension would not make sense. Normally ADIZs are declared on the basis of the range of the expected hostile  weaponry potentially in play. No such new weaponry is anticipated before the forecast horizon. In general, China is not noted for willingly placing itself in a posture of being humiliated upon a daily basis. In particular, the U.S. has made it clear that the only way China could enforce an ADIZ is by breaking things and killing people. In aerial combat, the things broken and people killed would be overwhelmingly Chinese. So even if U.S./China hostilities were to grow, China still would be begging for humiliation if it were to engage in aerial combat with the U.S. China is totally outclassed by U.S. fighter aircraft and pilots.

Ironically, the claims put forward by the PRC and Taipei are in a sort of alignment, especially when contrasted with the US's vision for the region. The US wants Taiwan to be a \"responsible stakeholder\" in the disputed waters by curtailing its claims and coming into accord with U.N. conventions. The US sees Taiwan, along with Japan, as allies to counterbalance the PRC.

Perhaps China is in the process of completing it's original plan for reclamation as suggested by some Chinese analysts.   These analysts argue that China should not officially declare an official ADIZ for the following reasons:  it increases military, political and diplomatic assertiveness that increases conflict relations between it, the US, Philippines, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Brunei who have independent claims in the South China Sea (the US as an exception to claims in the South China Sea, except for it's involvement and commitment to political and military alliances with affected nations). Reclamation in the South China Sea accomplishes power project by the Chinese state in it's longer term pursuits of hegemony as a global actor relative to the United States & Russia.  Since December 2013 it has reclaimed 2900 acres (1,170 hectares) of land use as of June 2015.  In August of this year, Beijing has claimed completion of reclamation.  However, militarization of these territories speak to further extension of military power and further assertiveness and aggression regionally and it longer term goal of global reach.  $5 trillion ship-borne trade passes through the South China Sea and implies its relative rise and an economic, political and military power.  Military expansion, capability and power in China is not disputed by available evidence. I suggest that de facto nature of reclamation and military assertiveness and use in the South China Sea accomplished both short term and longer term goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).  Declaring and official ADIZ within the South China Sea could have debilitating effects on the political and diplomatic accomplishment that are already a de facto reality.  So, there appears to be a greater utility in its power distribution and  concentration, without declaring an official ADIZ.

It's pathetic when China has to learn by watching CNN's video evidence of Navy pilot exploits over their artificial islands. It will be a long time before China would have any hope of enforcing an ADIZ. It is unlikely to subject itself to another source of incessant humiliation as has been the case with its much-abused East China Sea ADIZ.  Now consider they couldn't even DETECT a large, slow flying surveillance plane a few months ago. Just as with the East China Sea ADIZ, the first day they might declare it, Navy fighter pilots with hard to detect, fast, agile crafts will terrorize the less well trained, less well equipped Chinese pilots. True, the Navy fighters will solve China's problem of detecting them by buzzing their artificial islands and hunting out their pilots.

Diplomacy may ease tensions in the South China Sea.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs of now, the ROC-Taiwan province is not part of the East China ADIZ established in November, 2013 by the PRC. To extent the East China ADIZ south \"to cover part of the South China Sea\"  would mean including that region. This would be more than a bold move by the PRC in peace-time.  It would lead to direct and daily confrontation with the government in Taipei, and into confrontation directly with the US.  Extension south is not an alternative. A separate South China Sea ADIZ could be established which does not directly confront ROC-Taiwan or the US, but would  directly confront Philippines and  Vietnam, both who hold and occupy territory there.  The timing of this move would necessary be well before 1OCT2016.   In the late Spring  or early Summer of 2016, for example. While a later declaration in 2016 is possible one must take into account  the \"wet\" season(s) in parts of the South China Sea. While the EAM season begins in mid-May and is essentially over by November in the East China Sea leading to the long Winter dry season (thus the declaration of that ADIZ in November, 2013), this is not so in the islands of the South China Sea.  It can be varied and continue late into the year.  Remember the deadliest storm to strike the Philippines was Typhoon Yolanda in November 8, 2013.  ADIZs are not just \"declared\" like a parlor game.  They must be defended in the 21st Century. That China is building airbases on the rocks and coral reeves of the South China Sea ( threatening the Second Thomas Shoal, but focusing on the Spraetleys)  does give weight to the assessment that it will declare an ADIZ there.  That the PRC and Russia have just finished the largest naval exercise in history in the region (28AUG15) projects a strong edge in the Pacific. Yet following this unified show of naval forces, the PRC has not declared an South China Sea ADIZ.   The motivating reason for the East China ADIZ was the Hainan Island Incident in 2001. That was 12 years in the works. Neither the PRC nor the US wish to repeat anything similar at present. The question remains: Does the PRC need to declare a South China Sea ADIZ by mid-2016?
