The canal should be completed within one year of work starting, it said. The report was also carried by Saudi-owned news channel Al Arabiya and shared on Twitter by Saudi royal court adviser Saud Al Qahtani. \"The Saudi government\u2019s Center for International Communication didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The allies accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and meddling in their affairs, charges it denies. \"In April, media reported that the channel would be 60 kilometers (37.5 miles) long and 200 meters (219 yards) wide, running the entire length of the strip of Saudi territory that borders Qatar. Part of the canal zone would be set aside for a planned nuclear waste facility, Al Riyadh newspaper reported, and Sabq online newspaper said the canal project could cost up to 2.8 billion riyals ($750 million).\""], [42417, "2018-06-21T19:19:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [368, "2018-06-21T17:54:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57918, "2018-06-21T17:23:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-20T19:54:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [4681, "2018-06-20T13:12:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.88], ""], [368, "2018-06-19T23:42:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [21884, "2018-06-19T07:10:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [368, "2018-06-18T18:10:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [24162, "2018-06-18T12:56:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [59060, "2018-06-18T03:51:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-17T20:37:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-17T00:41:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-16T13:16:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-15T18:51:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [34376, "2018-06-15T16:00:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [34376, "2018-06-15T15:59:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [57918, "2018-06-15T13:36:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-14T19:58:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15045, "2018-06-14T14:06:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [58979, "2018-06-14T09:55:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [83, "2018-06-14T04:24:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [172, "2018-06-13T21:50:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [368, "2018-06-13T19:33:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30485, "2018-06-13T07:50:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [35658, "2018-06-13T00:57:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-12T18:14:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [58987, "2018-06-12T13:19:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [83, "2018-06-12T03:29:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [368, "2018-06-11T18:26:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-11T13:09:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-10T15:43:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-09T20:23:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2018-06-09T19:14:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15196, "2018-06-09T16:23:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [24162, "2018-06-09T12:59:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [368, "2018-06-08T18:57:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2018-06-08T13:48:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-07T18:13:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [58193, "2018-06-07T12:39:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [41737, "2018-06-07T11:19:29Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [41389, "2018-06-07T09:38:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [368, "2018-06-06T19:30:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [745, "2018-06-06T12:51:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [22276, "2018-06-06T05:17:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57918, "2018-06-06T00:25:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [57918, "2018-06-05T18:45:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-06-05T17:12:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1034, "2018-06-05T13:45:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1250, "2018-06-05T13:06:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "This would amount to a repudiation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s 13 demands and so is not a concession they will make in this short time span.\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/arab-states-issue-list-demands-qatar-crisis-170623022133024.html"], [19801, "2018-06-05T07:25:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "While their regional ambitions may have been overstretched, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have indicated this is a power-play for the long haul.

Although all countries share the same peninsula, their domestic and foreign policy goals differ greatly, especially the foreign policy of Qatar. The current row can be traced back to the mid-90's when Qatar launched Al-Jazeera, which began to increasingly cover news in the Arab world, putting the regions issues on the world spotlight and much to the annoyance of its gulf neighbors. In addition, with the rise of the Arab Spring and  new conflicts, Qatar has been accused of sending aid to groups at odds with its gulf neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The current standoff has also forced Qatar to make better ties with Iran, which is strategically and economically viable, as Qatar and Iran share gas fields. However, this alliance is unacceptable to the other Arab powers. In addition, Turkey and Russia have also voiced their support for Qatar, which are two countries with different goals in the region. It has also been interpreted that Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries are able to double down on the standoff, as the US has sent mixed messages and Trump's condemnation of Qatar for financing terrorist groups is emboldening other Arab countries in their standoff. Finally, Saudi Arabia is making heavy demands such as the closure of Al-Jazeera and severing ties with Iran as a prerequisite for ties to be normalized, which may be too costly for Qatar to accept. https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/06/17/533054129/qatars-crisis-with-saudi-arabia-and-gulf-neighbors-has-decades-long-roots\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/ed5af0b0-5fcd-11e7-8814-0ac7eb84e5f1\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/world/middleeast/qatar-saudi-emir-boycott.html"], [45429, "2018-04-30T23:01:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""], [368, "2018-04-30T19:35:37Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [11800, "2018-04-30T04:52:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [32539, "2018-04-30T03:31:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [37379, "2018-04-29T23:16:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-04-29T20:48:19Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [11800, "2018-04-29T17:28:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], "It makes the impression, that things could move forward fast in this matter due to other burning issues I dont see that importance  to the Saudis in this very matter, compared to other crisis and subcrisis\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-saudi-arabia-qatar-blockade.html"], [24162, "2018-04-29T16:53:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.06, 0.94], "Pompeo\u2019s Message to Saudis?

Qatar has, at this point, established core water routes to deliver consumables to the kingdom, and derives too great a percentage of its national revenues from its rights to the South Pars field to put its economic cooperation with Tehran at risk. Moreover, there are shared infrastructure advantages to working with Iran to transport natural gas out of those fields than to development standalone infrastructure within Qatar to do so on its own. WIth regard to the continued operation of al Jazeera, it is likely Qatar would be willing to make it into a sacrificial lamb and shut it down, but given that it has already made the offer to KSA with the condition that KSA leave their existing relationship with Iran in place, and KSA refused, they no longer have much to gain by shutting it down without also making a decision on the Iranian relationship. Given they have chosen to prioritize their relationship with Iran out of economic interests, and that they are no longer looking at shutting al Jazeera down, it is unlikely KSA will agree to re-establish normal economic traffic across Qatar's land border in the foreseeable future.

Doubling down on their denial of involvement with terrorism or Iran while making more public accusations is hardly likely to calm relations, which seem pretty stonewalled as present in any case and unlikely to get better while tensions & competition with Iran remain high.     \"One of the biggest Middle East crises in years was caused by the wife of an asylum seeker living in Britain, Qatar's foreign minister claimed yesterday. Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said his country's dispute with its Gulf neighbours began when it refused to hand the woman over to the United Arab Emirates. The mother-of-six and her husband, an unnamed Emirates opposition leader, fled to Qatar in 2013 during a period of political arrests against government opponents. \"...The husband then moved to the UK where he sought asylum and was granted indefinite leave to remain. But his wife, who has now joined her husband in Britain, initially decided to stay in Qatar because she had family ties there. When she tried to renew her passport at the Emirates embassy her application was refused and the authorities demanded her extradition.  Qatar's refusal to comply with the request led to UAE stepping up its attacks on the Doha government on social media and in the wider mainstream press. \"[...Repeated demands for extradition were] refused. Mr al-Thani said: 'Prince Tamim refused to extradite the woman because she was not wanted in a criminal offence, and this would be contrary to international law and the Qatari Constitution.' \"Two months later, on 5 June, a Saudi-led alliance including the UAE launched a diplomatic and transport blockade of Qatar accusing it of cosying up to Iran and supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.  Among its list of 13 demands, the quartet of countries ordered that all political dissidents were handed back to their countries of origin.  \"Later U.S. intelligence sources claimed the crisis had been sparked in June when the UAE hacked Qatar's official website and planted incendiary quotes which were attributed to the Emir, and praising the quartet's arch-enemy, Iran. This allowed Qatar's enemies to point the finger at Doha and claim it was a divisive force in the region....\" http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5263901/Qatar-crisis-began-did-not-hand-wanted-wife.html\nhttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/qatar-foreign-minister-claims-gulf-diplomatic-crisis-was-caused-by-one-womans-passport-1654969\nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5328679/uae-politician-wife-hiding-britain-fears-torture-qatar/#comments"], [1348, "2018-01-15T00:42:36Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [1034, "2018-01-14T22:11:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [368, "2018-01-14T21:55:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [48765, "2018-01-14T18:39:37Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 0.3], ""], [47894, "2018-01-14T17:32:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [30485, "2018-01-14T15:58:28Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [1667, "2018-01-14T13:51:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [45778, "2018-01-14T11:02:26Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.55], ""], [48494, "2018-01-14T10:43:32Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [48707, "2018-01-14T07:06:44Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], ""], [48705, "2018-01-14T05:45:00Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [48704, "2018-01-14T05:30:10Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.2, 0.55], ""], [48694, "2018-01-14T02:28:58Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2], "Every awful leader needs good news at some point.

Listing below certain facts and assumptions that have driven my prediction. Facts:\n1. Qatari leaders have excluded the possibility that the country will comply with the 13 demands. Have stated that accepting these demands will result the effective end of Qatari foreign policy.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/close-al-jazeera-saudi-arabia-issues-qatar-with-13-demands-to-end-blockade 2. While the blockade first negatively affected Qatar, the country has weathered the blockade better than expected by deepening its diplomatic, trade and military ties to regional powers outside the GCC, especially Iran and Turkey.\nhttps://www.thecipherbrief.com/no-end-sight-gulf-blockade-nudges-qatar-closer-iran 3. KSA FM has stated the political and economic boycott will continue until Qatar changes its policies for the better. Could last for another two years.\nhttps://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/9/6/saudis-threaten-qatar-with-two-more-years-of-blockade\nThe political and economic boycott will continue until Qatar changes its policies for the better, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said at a news conference. 4. KSA has played a key role in at least two sovereign changes in QAT history\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/21/qatar-crisis-may-be-rooted-in-old-family-rivalries Assumptions:\n1. Opening of the border will bound to Qatar and KSA making at least some progress in negotiating over the 13 demands that have been laid down by KSA & Co to end the blockade. This has today not happened as both sides ask for a zero-sum solution on their side. 2.Both sides are unlikely to make concessions that would satisfy the other side\na) KSA would certainly lose face if it was to back down from its 13 demands to Qatar\nb) Qatar would as mentioned give up much of its foreign policy sovereignty. Also there is increased patriotic feelings in Qatar - people showing defiance against KSA and Co. who they see as \"bullies\". Qatar's own leadership likely has to take into account these feelings of the local populace.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/us-may-intervene-in-qatar-crisis-as-fears-grow-over-long-term-rupture 3. More to the crisis than at first meets the eye - core differences between the opposing sides in numerous issues (political, ideological, economical)\na)Likelihood that the issues not only political but also personal \u2013 KSA and UAE leaders want regime change? KSA as mentioned has before intervened in Qatar's internal affairs.\nb) Battle of Wahhabi trends - Qatars more moderate, flexible vs KSA's more traditional conservative.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/21/qatar-crisis-may-be-rooted-in-old-family-rivalries\nc) Regional competition lies at its root is a  between Qatar and the UAE and, increasingly, Saudi.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/25/us-may-intervene-in-qatar-crisis-as-fears-grow-over-long-term-rupture. 4. On the other hand blockade hurts both sides:\na) KSA and Co - Qatar is moving closer to the regional rivals of KSA.
