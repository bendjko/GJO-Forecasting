I guess it seems like an appropriate time post-earning to take a lay of the land and forecast this question again.I continue to believe that Meta is pretty drastically oversold when compared to it's Mega-cap tech peers. It continues to be a cashflow generating machine that despite some concerns about it's old namesake product; has been diversifying into a bunch of different products and areas of business for years. (See my initial forecast: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1416352 )\u00a0However, up until earnings it appeared that Macro factors caused by Monetary tightening by the FED were leading to compression across the Tech sector as a whole; dragging Meta down with it. (I originally thought that aggressive monetary tightening was already priced into the market after the interest rate hikes at the March meeting. Apparently it was not entirely priced in at that point). I was just about ready to capitulate that these Macro factors would lead to the stock remaining below the threshold beyond the deadline date if earnings resulted in a flat to negative result.However, with the large rebound of the stock after reporting earning, the NASDAQ (At least currently) holding key levels around 12600, and several other large Mega-cap tech companies reporting after the bell today; it seems like we could be primed for a continued dramatic reversal if AAPL and/or AMZN put up big number tonight. (Driving up tech at an index level)Right now FB is sitting at ~$205, needing about ~14% in the next month, and is approaching key price levels around ~$210. If FB is able to overcome this $210 in the next week or so it technically appears to have a lot of room to run to the upside. (I am assuming if it can break back above this level in the next week we are likely to see this resolve as a \"Yes\") If the NASDAQ rebounds back off it's 12600 level (AAPL and AMZN earning should be a big factor in this) this seems likely to me. If FB rejects this ~$210 level and/or the NASDAQ breaks down below the ~12600 level in the next week than I think this one almost certainly a \"No\".\u00a0I do think that the NASDAQ will hold these key levels and rebound, which in turn will drive FB up with it above ~$210 this week.

I believe there is strong fundamental reason to think this rally should continue (See my initial forecast: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1416352 ) when looking at FB as an individual stock. I also believe at the sector level the NASDAQ bottomed on March 14th(See my second forecast https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1419031 ) with fear of a taper tantrum caused by the FED beginning rate liftoff and the hight of fear surrounding the initial invasion of Ukraine reaching a fever pitch. The initial rate hikes came and went without the tantrum and the market digested that the Ukrainian crisis is likely to be a more ongoing crisis without immediate implication for Mega-cap tech companies. As such we have had the beginning of a relief rally. To add to all of this when digging into some of the technicals of the market we can see that FB is currently sitting at a 30 day implied volatility of 39.2% when looking at options contracts with a put-to-call ratio sitting at 0.35. (https://volafy.net/equity/FB ) This would indicate that we should expect larger than average moves in the price in the coming weeks (at least until current contracts expire) with the bulls outweighing the bears. To add to this FB has broken above it's 1st SMA, with plenty of room to the upside to retrace back to the 2nd and 3rd SMAs. From a technical standpoint if the stock is able to brake $225 it should easily pass $238 before the deadline. (I will note, I am a little sceptical of relying too much on technical analysis as it can feel a bit too much like a soft science for my liking, but I have found it very useful for trying to predict short term moves when combined with fundamentals.)

A potentially big move in share price could come after the next quarterly earnings report in early May, but other events could also affect the price as well, of course.

This is a significant increase, but 10% monthly increases are by no means unheard of for FB, we see many examples in the Post COVID recovery period. FBs most recent pull back can -- in my opinion -- mainly be attributed to a combination of forecasts of declining growth in their old namesake product, issues with targeted advertising as the resulting from iOS changes, the rise of Tik Tok, uncertainty around the companies name change and direction of the company going froward, recent questions around ethics and business practices, and a general market trend away from growth and tech and into value. While these are legitimate concerns, I think the stock has been far too oversold. Ultimately this is a company that still has a massive source of revenue that it is able to funnel back into R&D to fund just about whatever ambitions it has. Also, while a lot of emphasis has been put on the future prospects for it's old name sake product, I think it is overlook how many other things this company has been working on for years. Even outside of well known assets like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. They have made massive inroads in e-commerce space helping sellers with direct sales through FB and Insta, extensive work on advanced AI (can be seen with their automatic post translations, Spanish to english is particularly good), are one of the first companies to put out a pair of AR glasses in the Ray-Band Stories, have been making gaming acquisitions all over the place since 2020, support one of the largest backend infrastructures that could be used to spun out into an AWS type hosting service if they so desired, and still has one of the larger and more talented employee pools out there. Ultimately, Meta is not just Facebook. It hasn't been for a long time; even before the name change. I think recent moves put too much emphasis on risks to their old name sake product, and undervalue the rest of the company. If there is reversal in tech at an index level, I would expect FB to get bought up hand over fist as it will be seen as incredible value compared to it's Mega-cap peers.
