The organization requested and received a voter file in an email from the State Department, but the message was copied to waqas@kavtech.net, which is the email for Waqas Butt, CEO of Pakistani-based Kavtech Solutions Ltd. In a letter (pdf) to Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers, Catherine Engelbrecht, the president of True the Vote, wrote that she was shocked to discover the Pakistani address in the carbon copy field of the email. \u201cThe fact that this company was cc\u2019d on an email containing access to the Nevada voter registration database appears to be evidence of a breach within the Nevada Secretary of State\u2019s email system,\u201d Engelbrecht wrote. \u201cObviously, the problems that such a breach may evidence include access to at least the voter registration information of Nevada residents. At worst it could reveal a breach that gives foreign power access to not only the State of Nevada\u2019s systems but also to the email systems of anyone whom the State communicates with via email.\u201d We didn\u2019t find any connection on Kavtech\u2019s\u00a0website, but maybe we wouldn\u2019t since it\u2019s military and intelligence \u2014 allegedly.\"\nhttps://www.independentsentinel.com/suspicious-link-found-between-nv-election-system-pakistani-intelligence/"], [13657, "2020-12-06T22:56:23Z", [0.01], ""], [1034, "2020-12-06T22:24:18Z", [1.0], ""], [13657, "2020-12-06T22:16:43Z", [0.15], ""], [73050, "2020-12-06T21:23:07Z", [0.0], ""], [13657, "2020-12-06T20:04:58Z", [0.04], "Increasing prediction due to Alito's recent decision to move the date closer for a response on the Pennsylvania case.\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/political/alito-moves-deadline-supreme-court-briefing-pennsylvania-case-bringing-within-safe-harbor"], [64, "2020-12-06T20:03:32Z", [0.0], ""], [14432, "2020-12-06T19:15:21Z", [0.0], ""], [534, "2020-12-06T18:49:24Z", [0.05], ""], [534, "2020-12-06T18:47:55Z", [0.15], ""], [690, "2020-12-06T18:20:46Z", [0.01], ""], [1019, "2020-12-06T17:19:41Z", [0.0], ""], [96729, "2020-12-06T14:08:35Z", [0.01], "The strength of the recount argument has weakened, and I assess the potential political advantage of a SCOTUS hearing as negative for the President at this point."], [691, "2020-12-06T13:45:37Z", [0.0], ""], [75824, "2020-12-06T01:00:12Z", [0.0], ""], [96785, "2020-12-05T21:35:53Z", [0.0], "Trumps legal team is 1-42 on their cases thus far.

I believe we are not so far removed from our roots, memories of persecution and struggles for freedom for all..... that we would accept the yoke of slavery and persecutions of ANY type again.  One of my 11th great-grandfathers\u00a0was a\u00a0Mayflower\u00a0Passenger. William Bradford. \"In 1620, a group of pilgrims left England seeking religious freedom. Upon their arrival in the New World, they created the Mayflower Compact, which established self-governance for the colony and helped shape the nation that eventually became the United States of America. The best information on William Bradford is found in his own writings, particularly in his history of the Plymouth Colony (there is a fascinating story of how this manuscript was found after having been lost for many years). William Bradford as a young man from Yorkshire, England became affiliated with the Separatists, who had gone beyond the Puritan thinking and wanted to be completely separate from the official Church of England. He joined a congregation at Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, led by Richard Clyfton and John Robinson. William Brewster, who was master of the post station at Scrooby, joined this church and later became its Ruling Elder, while William Bradford also joined the church and became a life-long follower and friend to Elder Brewster. After being persecuted in England, the congregation decided in 1607 to move to Holland - living for one year in Amsterdam and then moving to Leiden. Many of the congregation worked in some fashion in the clothing trade to support themselves, with William Bradford employed as a fustian maker (rough sturdy cloth made of cotton and flax).\nConcerned about economic problems as not being citizens of Leiden and about temptations facing their children, these Separatists in Leiden learned about North America from the writings of Captain John Smith who was at the Jamestown, VA settlement. They turned down an offer from Captain Smith to captain a ship to take them to North America and chose for their captain an English soldier living in Holland named Myles Standish. Those Separatists in Leiden who traveled to England to cross the ocean were joined by other Separatists and by some people called \"Strangers\" by Bradford (not members of their faith, but with whom they had to ravel in order to get support for their venture). The first group left England on 23 Aug 1620 in two ships, but the Speedwell sprung a leak and had to return to England while the Mayflower continued on alone. Their intended destination in \"Northern Virginia' was to have been about where Manhattan is located today, but they sailed further north - outside the Virginia limits. After first anchoring at the Provincetown harbor on Cape Cod, they explored the Plymouth harbor and decided to settle there. While still anchored in the Provincetown harbor, all free adults signed the Mayflower Compact, which stated essentially that the individual would subject himself to majority rule. Dorothy (May) Bradford, first wife of William Bradford, died 7 Dec 1620 by drowning at Provincetown while Bradford was away exploring the Plymouth area. After the death of the first governor, John Carver, in 1621, William Bradford was chosen to succeed him.\u00a0He continued to be elected to this position for the years 1621-33, 1635, 1637, 1639-43, and 1645-56. At his death, he reportedly was the richest man in the colony. He left a library containing 275 books and is said to have had a knowledge of several languages, including Hebrew. His noncupative Will was dated 9 May 1657 and proved 3 Jun 1657.\"  Genealogical records are available to all with a little digging. It is quite amazing how far one can go back. In my case, I have connected to verified lines that go back over a thousand years and am directly related to people I've read about in history books my whole life (even Vlad the impaler ((and a whole plethora of heros and villains)))."], [1034, "2020-11-15T05:19:00Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2020-11-15T04:57:00Z", [1.0], ""], [61598, "2020-11-15T02:37:23Z", [0.03], ""], [14027, "2020-11-15T02:31:18Z", [0.05], "@Poli_Sci_Guy cites good points against SCOTUS getting involved.

When there's scant or no evidence for it, it's not even illegal.  It is telling that all the cases brought so far have been rubbished by the courts of first instance, whether state or federal.
