Anadolu news agency published a report on Tuesday naming the location of 10 U.S. military posts in northern Syria, in some cases detailing the number of U.S and French troops present. \"The release of sensitive military information exposes Coalition forces to unnecessary risk and has the potential to disrupt ongoing operations to defeat ISIS,\" said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, using an acronym for Islamic State. \"While we cannot independently verify the sources that contributed to this story, we would be very concerned if officials from a NATO ally would purposefully endanger our forces by releasing sensitive information,\" Pahon said. He added that the United States has voiced its concerns to Turkey. Relations between Ankara and Washington have already been shaken by a U.S. decision to support and arm Kurdish YPG fighters to drive Islamic State from their Raqqa stronghold in Syria. Turkey views the YPG as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. It fears an effort to form a contiguous Kurdish state embracing some Turkish territory. Ankara was infuriated last month when Washington \u2013 which has designated the PKK as a terrorist group - announced that it would continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy of arming the YPG, although U.S. officials insist that the United States will retrieve the weapons provided once Islamic State is defeated.

It was not clear whether there were any casualties. Turkish officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the report, which said Turkey's military retaliated after YPG fighters opened fire on their positions. Afrin is in northwest Syria and near the border with Turkey. The United States supports the YPG in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, despite repeated protests from NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Syrian Kurdish fighters as terrorists and fears their advance will inflame a Kurdish insurgency at home. Turkey was angered by a U.S. decision last month to arm the YPG as part of the battle for Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa. Ankara considers the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is outlawed in Turkey and is also considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union.

Erdogan, who has sided with Qatar against Saudi Arabia in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, had previously held his silence on the crisis.

At a White House meeting, Trump lauded Erdogan as an important ally in the \"fight against terrorism\" and did not mention Erdogan's domestic crackdown after last year's failed coup attempt. \"We've had a great relationship and we will make it even better,\" Trump said in their joint appearance. Erdogan said his visit would \"mark a historical turn of tide\" and hailed \"outstanding relations\" between the nations. It was an especially positive tone considering the tensions over Washington's decision to arm the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia that Ankara regards as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Fighting erupted among protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence, resulting in multiple injuries and two arrests - one for aggravated assault and one for assault on a police officer, a city police spokesman said. The spokesman, officer Hugh Carew, said the origin of the melee was still under investigation. A local NBC television affiliate reported Erdogan was inside the building at the time. The city fire department reported nine wounded were taken to a local hospital. U.S. officials on May 9 disclosed Trump's approval of plans to supply the YPG as it advances toward the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. Turkey has been a partner in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State forces. The U.S. alliance with Turkey has proven pivotal in the battle against Islamic State in Syria, providing the coalition with access to Turkey's Incirlik air base to wage strikes against the militants. Erdogan had pledged to use the White House meeting to try to get Trump to change course on the YPG.

The interview was Yildirim\u2019s first since an April 16 referendum, which was preceded by massive government-backed stimulus for lending after the nation\u2019s slowest growth rate since a contraction in 2009. The referendum, backed by Yildirim, hands President Recep Tayyip Erdogan enhanced executive authority and by 2019, will lead to the abolishing of Yildirim\u2019s current job. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take such measures,\u201d Yildirim said of the economic stimulus program, speaking in a ballroom at the Cankaya Palace. \u201cThe revival of the domestic economy will increase even more.\u201d Investors have so far welcomed the outcome of the referendum, even as questions remain about how Erdogan will use his enhanced powers to revive growth, bring inflation under control and support the currency, which has lost almost a quarter of its value against the dollar in the past year. The benchmark Turkish stock gauge closed at a record high on Monday, while the lira has appreciated 1.8 percent against the greenback since the vote. Infrastructure Spending A former transportation minister, Yildirim\u2019s attention focused largely on infrastructure investment. Turkey plans to spur spending of about 100 billion liras ($28 billion) in rail projects over the next 10 years, as well as pouring money into new highways, hospital developments, airports, shipping, student dorm facilities, electric energy and urban regeneration. \u201cThis is why Turkey\u2019s economy tripled in size and exports quadrupled\u201d since the ruling AK Party came to power in 2002, he said. \u201cWhile the world was running from crisis to crisis, Turkey carried out some of the largest projects in the world.\u201d Urban regeneration, which includes destroying and rebuilding structures that are insufficiently earthquake-proof, will help to drive domestic consumption and employment over the next decades, he said. Many of those projects will be moved off the government budget through partnerships with the private sector, he said. \u201cLarge projects can\u2019t be done out of the state\u2019s general budget because first you\u2019re going to do your spending on people\u2019s health, education and defense,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s money left over, you\u2019ll do big infrastructure projects.\u201d Because in the past that wasn\u2019t possible, Turkey turned to public-private partnerships and build-operate-transfer models, and plans to continue investing in that way, he said (para. 1-8).

Norbert Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and head of the foreign affairs committee, said failing to issue consequences after the referendum vote would hurt Europe. \"We would damage the credibility of Europe if we failed to respond to Turkey's decision against democracy, against the rule of law ... if we continue to hold fast to the fiction of accession for a country with such a government and such a constitution,\" Roettgen told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk in an interview to air on Sunday. He said pretending that Turkey could join the EU would also prevent Europe from forging a new, more realistic relationship with Turkey. Turks voted a week ago by a narrow margin to abolish the post of prime minister and concentrate power in the hands of the president, the biggest overhaul of Turkey's political system since the modern state was established nearly a century ago. The results have been challenged in court by Turkey's main opposition party, and independent election monitors from the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe have questioned the vote. Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Bavaria and a member of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, said EU accession talks for Turkey should be ended, not paused. \"It's about time that the EU membership negotiations are ended,\" Herrmann told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. \"We have to stop kidding ourselves: There are no common perspectives with the Turkey of Erdogan\" (para. 1-8).

Erdogan called Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and the leader of the nationalist MHP party, which supported the \"Yes\" vote, to congratulate them, presidential sources said. They quoted Erdogan as saying the referendum result was clear. A \"Yes\" vote would replace Turkey's parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency and may see Erdogan in office until at least 2029, in the most radical change to the country's political system in its modern history. The outcome will also shape Turkey's strained relations with the European Union. The NATO member state has curbed the flow of migrants - mainly refugees from wars in Syria and Iraq - into the bloc but Erdogan says he may review the deal after the vote. In Turkey's three biggest cities - Istanbul, Izmir and the capital Ankara - the \"No\" camp appeared set to prevail narrowly, according to Turkish television stations (para. 1-6).

Opinion polls have given a narrow lead for a \"Yes\" vote in Sunday's referendum to replace Turkey's parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency, a move Erdogan says is needed to confront the security and political challenges Turkey faces. Opponents say it is a step towards greater authoritarianism in a country where 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup attempt against Erdogan last July. Western countries have criticized that tough response, and relations with the EU - which Turkey has been negotiating to join for a decade - hit a low during the campaign when Erdogan accused European leaders of acting like Nazis for banning referendum rallies in their countries on security grounds. He has also said Turkey could review a deal under which it limits the flow of migrants - many of them refugees fleeing war in neighboring Syria and Iraq - into the European Union unless the bloc implements plans to grant Turks visa-free travel. At a rally in Istanbul, one of four he held in the last hours before Sunday's vote, Erdogan described the constitutional proposals as the biggest change in Turkey since the country was established nearly a century ago, and the culmination of the response to July's abortive putsch. \"Sunday will be a turning point in the fight against terrorist organizations. We will finish what we started on July 15 this April 16,\" he told a crowd in Istanbul's Tuzla district, decked with Turkish flags and giant pictures of the president (para. 1-7). Gumrukcu, T.

Since the collapse of a two-year-old ceasefire in July 2015, the mainly Kurdish southeast has been rocked by some of the most intense fighting in three decades of conflict between Kurdish militants and Turkish security forces. According to a United Nations estimate, about 2,000 people were killed and up to a half a million displaced in the state's conflict with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), strongly supported in the southeast but cast by Erdogan as an extension of the PKK, was among the targets of the president's ire during a rallying speech in the region's largest city Diyarbakir. \"These supporters of the PKK keep on saying 'peace, peace, peace'. Does empty talk bring peace? Could there be peace with those who walk around with weapons in their hands?\" he said. \"We are the guardians of peace, we are the guardians of freedoms,\" he said as a crowd of several thousand in the city centre waved Turkish flags. \"WALK TOGETHER\" The ruling AK Party, which Erdogan founded, also has strong support in the southeast.

Gen. Mike Flynn, while serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign, met with top Turkish government ministers and discussed removing a Muslim cleric from the U.S. and taking him to Turkey, according to former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, who attended, and others who were briefed on the meeting. The discussion late last summer involved ideas about how to get Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating last summer\u2019s failed military coup, to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process, according to Mr. Woolsey and those who were briefed. Mr. Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal he arrived at the meeting in New York on Sept. 19 in the middle of the discussion and found the topic startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal. The Turkish ministers were interested in open-ended thinking on the subject, and the ideas were raised hypothetically, said the people who were briefed. The ministers in attendance included the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the country\u2019s foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show. Mr. Woolsey said the idea was \u201ca covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.\u201d The discussion, he said, didn\u2019t include actual tactics for removing Mr. Gulen from his U.S. home. If specific plans had been discussed, Mr. Woolsey said, he would have spoken up and questioned their legality. It isn\u2019t known who raised the idea or what Mr. Flynn concluded about it. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Mr. Flynn, who was advising the Trump campaign on national security at the time of the meeting, disputed the account, saying \u201cat no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, non-judicial physical removal or any other such activities.\u201d Mr. Flynn served as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser for 24 days and resigned after he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contact with a Russian diplomat. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether Trump campaign officials collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election. On March 2, weeks after Mr. Flynn\u2019s departure from the Trump administration, the Flynn Intel Group, his consulting firm, filed with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. Mr. Trump was unaware Mr. Flynn had been consulting on behalf of the Turkish government when he named him national security adviser, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this month. In its filing, Mr. Flynn\u2019s firm said its work from August to November \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d The filing said his firm\u2019s fee, $530,000, wasn\u2019t paid by the government but by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin.\nU.S.-Turkish relations deteriorated in the final year of the Obama administration over disagreements about extraditing Mr. Gulen and U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish forces battling Islamic State. The Turkish government has been demanding Mr. Gulen\u2019s extradition to face charges that he was the architect of an unsuccessful military coup last summer to overthrow Mr. Erdogan (para. 1-11).

Turkey has been embroiled in a dispute with Germany and the Netherlands over campaign appearances by Turkish officials seeking to drum up support for an April 16 referendum that could boost Erdogan's powers. Ankara has accused its European allies of using \"Nazi methods\" by banning Turkish ministers from addressing rallies in Europe over security concerns. The comments have led to a sharp deterioration in ties with the European Union, which Turkey still aspires to join. \"Turkey is not a country you can pull and push around, not a country whose citizens you can drag on the ground,\" Erdogan said at an event for Turkish journalists in Ankara, in comments broadcast live on national television. \"If Europe continues this way, no European in any part of the world can walk safely on the streets. Europe will be damaged by this. We, as Turkey, call on Europe to respect human rights and democracy,\" he said.

The complaints come even as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan himself has slammed European countries for not letting his ministers campaign on their soil for the April 16 vote on giving his office more power. Erdogan kept up the criticism in an Istanbul speech on Sunday, denouncing the Netherlands and then singling out German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"You are committing Nazi practices too,\" he said. \"To whom? To my Turkish brothers and sisters in Germany.\" Politicians campaigning against the constitutional changes proposed by the Turkish president also say the state of emergency in Turkey since a failed coup attempt in July prevents them from getting their message out ahead of the vote. \"Those who advocate for a 'no' vote are faced with a series of obstructions,\" said Utku Cakirozer, a former journalist who is now a lawmaker for the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP. While he, too, criticized moves by Germany and the Netherlands to stop Turkish ministers from campaigning to Turkish citizens abroad, Cakirozer said \"our democracy bar has been lowered a great deal and needs to be raised rapidly.\" At stake are changes that would usher in an executive presidential system, merging the powers of the prime minister and the president. Erdogan argues that a strong presidency will make Turkey better equipped to deal with economic and security challenges. Critics say it would give Erdogan too much control and further erode the democratic separation of powers in the country. With opinion polls suggesting the outcome of the tight race could be determined by yet-undecided voters, \"no\" campaigners say they face an uphill battle because Turkey's TV channels are either pro-government or refrain from broadcasts critical of the government for fear of reprisals. Erdogan and members of the government have dominated the airwaves, holding twice-daily campaign speeches that are televised live in their entirety on all channels. Inauguration ceremonies and state-funded official trips also frequently turn into \"yes\" campaign events. Meanwhile, the pro-government media largely ignore campaign rallies by the \"no\" camp. Even state-owned media, which is obliged to be neutral, cuts away early from speeches delivered by CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu.

Erdogan, referring to Islamic State's remaining stronghold, told a joint Moscow news conference with the Russian President \"Of course, the real target now is Raqqa\".\nTurkey is seeking a role for its military in the advance on Raqqa, but the United States is veering toward enlisting the Kurdish YPG militia - something contrary to Ankara's aim of banishing Kurdish fighters\u2019 eastwards across the Euphrates river. Turkey considers the YPG the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has been fighting an insurrection on Turkish soil for 30 years. Washington, like Ankara, considers the PKK a terrorist group, but it backs the YPG. Russian-backed forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are also operating in the north of the country, close to Turkish borders. Washington and Moscow are concerned fast-moving military developments could lead to serious clashes between Turkish forces and the YPG. \"It should now be accepted that a terrorist organization cannot be defeated with another one,\" Erdogan said, referring to the enlistment of YPG by the United States to fight Islamic State. \"As a country that has been battling terror for 35 years, terrorist organizations like Daesh (Islamic State), the YPG, Nusra front and others are organizations we face at all times\u201d (para. 1-7).

Authorities issued the detention warrants in simultaneous operations in 86 locations across four provinces, Anadolu reported, adding that 43 of the suspects had so far been caught. It said the suspects were being sought on charges of \"leading or being a member of an armed terrorist organization\". Since the July coup attempt, Turkish authorities have detained, dismissed or suspended some 120,000 people including soldiers, police officers, teachers, judges and journalists, and formally arrested nearly 40,000 people. Thousands have since been restored to their posts. Companies with ties to the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom President Tayyip Erdogan and the government accuse of orchestrating the coup attempt, have also been targeted in the crackdown. Hundreds of companies, for the most part smaller provincial firms, have been seized. The cleric, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied the accusations against him and condemned the coup. Following reports of the operation, ASELSAN shares initially fell as much as 5.24 percent. They had recovered to around 0.7 percent down by 0830 GMT (para. 1-6). Gumrukcu, T. (2017).

In speeches, interviews and newspaper opinion pieces, they argue that giving the president more powers is the only answer to a wave of terrorist attacks, a raging conflict with Kurdish separatists, an economic slowdown and the turmoil that followed a failed coup attempt in July. \n\u201cThe constitutional change opens the way for a strong, great and prosperous Turkey,\u201d Erdogan said in Istanbul on Feb. 11. \u201cThe nation needs this system, not me.\u201d\nYet while the AK Party says parliament will still be able to curb the president\u2019s authority, opponents say the changes would promote autocracy by weakening checks and balances (para. 1-7).

The government accuses the HDP, which made history last year by becoming the first Kurdish party to win 10% of the vote and enter parliament, of financing and supporting an armed Kurdish insurgency, which it denies. he HDP announced a partial boycott of parliament on Sunday, saying it was \u201chalting its legislative efforts\u201d and that its deputies would stop participating in sessions of the legislature or meetings of parliamentary commissions.

More than 110,000 officials \u2013 from soldiers and judges to teachers and journalists \u2013 have been detained or suspended since a failed military coup in July, in what Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics say is a crackdown on all forms of dissent. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they call me dictator or whatever else, it goes in one ear, out the other.

The relations between Germany and Turkey saw some improvements over the past months, which is indirectly evidenced by the fact that in the beginning of October Turkey allowed a delegation of German MPs to visit Incirlik military base, where Bundeswehr soldiers are serving. This decision was a result of lengthy negotiations between the German and the Turkish authorities, after which the official Berlin basically distanced itself from Bundestag resolution on \"Armenian genocide\", which angered Turkey, and in response the republic softened its position on the visit of a group of German parliamentarians to Incirlik. However, this period of mutual understanding between the two countries did not last for long. In late October Turkish authorities did not allow MPs from the 'Left' party to visit Incirlik military base, since this party is considered to be pro-Kurdish. This decision wasn't unreasonable, since many supporters of the 'Left' party clearly sympathize with left Marxist ideology of the PKK (para. 1-2). Sattarov, O. (2016).

The suggestion, against all evidence, is that better statesmen, or perhaps a more patriotic one, could have gotten more. Among other things, Erdogan\u2019s reinterpretation of history shows the ironies behind the widespread talk in the United States of his supposed \u201cneo-Ottomanism.\u201d A decade ago, Erdogan\u2019s enthusiasm for all things Ottoman appeared to be part of an effective strategy for improving relations with the Muslim Middle East, a policy that some U.S. critics saw as a challenge to their country\u2019s role in the region. But refashioning the National Pact as a justification for irredentism rather than a rebuke of it has not been popular among Turkey\u2019s neighbors. Criticism of Erdogan\u2019s neo-Ottoman foreign policy is now as likely to come from the Arab world as anywhere else. Erdogan\u2019s use of the National Pact also demonstrates how successfully Turkey\u2019s Islamists have reappropriated, rather than rejected, elements of the country\u2019s secular nationalist historical narrative. Government rhetoric has been quick to invoke the heroism of Turkey\u2019s war of independence in describing the popular resistance to the country\u2019s July 15 coup attempt. And alongside the Ottomans, Erdogan routinely references the Seljuks, a Turkic group that preceded the Ottomans in the Middle East by several centuries, and even found a place for more obscure pre-Islamic Turkic peoples like the Gokturks, Avars, and Karakhanids that first gained fame in Ataturk\u2019s 1930s propaganda. Similarly, in Syria and Iraq, Erdogan is aiming to achieve a long-standing national goal, the defeat of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), by building on the traditional nationalist tools of Turkish foreign policy \u2014 namely, the leveraging of Turkish minorities in neighboring countries. The Sultan Murad Brigade, comprising predominantly ethnic Turkmens, has been one of Ankara\u2019s military assets inside Syria against both Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and the PKK. Meanwhile, the Turkmen population living around Mosul and its surrounding area has been a concern and an asset for Ankara in Iraq. Turkish special forces have worked with the Iraqi Turkmen Front since at least 2003 in order to expand Turkish influence and counter the PKK in northern Iraq (para. 5-9). Danforth, N. (2016).

The jets targeted positions of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in three villages, northeast of the city of Aleppo, that the SDF had captured from Islamic State, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late on Wednesday. The Turkish military confirmed its warplanes had carried out 26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia, the strongest force in the SDF, and that it had killed between 160 and 200 combatants. The British-based Observatory monitoring group reported a much lower toll of at least 14 dead and dozens wounded. Officials of the Kurdish-led administration that controls much of northeastern Syria said dozens had been killed. Complicating matters further, Syria's military called the strikes by Turkey an act of \"blatant aggression\" and said it would bring down any Turkish war planes entering Syrian air space (para. 1-6).

Erdogan\u2019s hostile comments against Iraq and PM Abadi on October 11, however, are part of a greater trend by Erdogan to posture Turkey as having a right to influence any decision made about northern Iraq. Erdogan went as far as to give the date for operations to begin in Mosul during an interview on September 25, pre-dating the argument over Turkey\u2019s force renewal on October 1. Erdogan\u2019s over-the-top statements do not yet indicate that Turkey will increase its presence in northern Iraq, where they are currently training Sunni forces to retake and hold Mosul. His firm rhetoric does, however, suggest that he is reserving Turkey\u2019s right to operate in northern Iraq, primarily to counter the expansion of Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) on the Turkish-Iraqi border and prevent them from participating in Mosul operations.
