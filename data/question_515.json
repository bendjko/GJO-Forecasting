I spoke with Germans in Myanmar yesterday, the rally around the flag effect is immense and people in Myanmar don't pay too much attention to how this issue is being reported on outside their country. While Aung San Suu Kyi obv. will adress this issue in her speech, she will prob. continue to focus on other conflicts in Myanmar nontheless as also the population doesn't care too much about the fate of the Rohingya. I assume she will frame this issue as one of outside militias vs. the state of Myanmar against which people will have to unify. There are a lot of fake news out there (from both sides) and most people inside Myanmar probably believe that fleeing Rohingyas burned down their houses themselves to be able to accuse the government of ethnic cleansing and damage it's reputation. There are some video campaigns suggesting exactly that (although they are flawed as videos allegedly displaying residents burning down their own houses show the same man in multiply villages etc.). Meaning: There are militias in civilian clothing perpetrating atrocities & as the situation is developing right now, it is highly unlikely that the perpetrators will be held accountable. If clearance operation continue, it can therefore be assumed that the death toll will continue to rise. The extent of the violence is however very unclear, as is the amount of perpetrators involved. What is different in relation to earlier episodes of violence, is that also villages not being known as strongholds of the resistance are getting destroyed. The violence therefore is more widespread and deliberately targets Rohingya civilians. Due to the restricted access to the area, we mainly rely on sattelite images of burned down villages and reports by Rohingya refugees and doctors in Bangladesh. There are obv. refugees with gunshot wounds etc, & there are also first confirmed cases of rape, but they don't surpass 100 cases. How widespread the violence is, is therefore still unclear. Afaik there is also no evidence yet, that militias/security forces e.g. burn down houses while residence are still inside / near. It's possible that they \"only\" burn down houses after residents fled, so that they won't return. This would still constitute ethnic cleansing, but obv. this practice would lead to a lower death toll than outright attacks."], [12302, "2017-09-18T13:49:55Z", [0.6], "Comment deleted on Sep 18, 2017 02:00PM UTC"], [691, "2017-09-18T11:57:32Z", [0.62], ""], [6303, "2017-09-18T03:50:12Z", [0.6], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-09-17T20:40:54Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-17T19:26:55Z", [0.56], "In my copious free time I wonder whether folks must die within in Myanmar if they wish to be counted, or can they contribute to the total if they flee Myanmar and then die in Bangladesh of wounds or starvation or disease.
