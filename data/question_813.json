First, because Amazon has been searching for its second headquarters for more than a year, it is logical to conclude that Amazon will hold a press conference to announce this decision. The concluding time for this challenge question is 2:59 AM EST on 1 October 2018, approximately two hours from now. Therefore, it is unlikely that Amazon will have a press conference to announce their decision, while their audience would be substantially suboptimal, within the next two hours.\ufeff Second, reports have been published that Amazon officials visited a Chicago bid location in late August, alluding to the fact that the selection process is ongoing (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hq2-reps-visited-chicago-second-time-report-2018-9). These officials' trip to the Chicago location is notable, as \" it could mean the contest is far from over, and it may be more-open than had previously been speculated.\" (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-hq2-reps-visited-chicago-second-time-report-2018-9). Lastly,  Amazon officials have asserted that they will make their decision by the end of the year and strategically it would be the most logical to wait to select a city until after the 2018 elections, as Amazon will seek to ensure that the deals and incentives that they received from respective city and state governments are still valid post-election (https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-announce-the-location-of-its-second-hq-by-the-end-of-2018-2018-9)"], [34516, "2018-10-01T02:44:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [11080, "2018-10-01T02:22:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1738, "2018-10-01T01:20:36Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [13970, "2018-10-01T00:45:04Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [83, "2018-10-01T00:20:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [38, "2018-09-30T22:03:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [534, "2018-09-30T20:48:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [58753, "2018-09-30T20:37:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "They announced it would be by year-end."], [5019, "2018-09-30T19:42:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [23879, "2018-09-30T18:37:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Last day.

Speculation about where the e-commerce giant will decide to put down stakes for its second US headquarters has ramped up considerably in recent days, with the announcement of the winning location seemingly pretty imminent. Conventional wisdom is that the announcement is coming anytime now, certainly by the end of the year, and we\u2019re already passed the one-year mark since the search got under way. Bezos reportedly won\u2019t have an announcement to make on Thursday, according to a Tuesday afternoon report from The Washington Post. Intriguingly, though, Amazon\u2019s board of directors will be in town, too, leading to speculation that Jeff wants to show off the city to them ahead of a formal announcement. It\u2019s not yet clear if there will be a formal meeting of the board while in DC. Meanwhile, among some of the other clues making DC seem likely a likely choice: Amazon has just joined the Washington DC Chamber of Commerce as a paying member.. . .  At the end of July, the Puget Sound Business Journal also spotted an Amazon job listing that sought a DC-based economic development manager \u2014 a job the company doesn\u2019t appear to have posted in any other city, according to the paper. \u201cThe job posting says Amazon is looking for someone with experience in economic incentives, which will likely play a major factor in its HQ2 project. It says the economic development manager would work directly with \u2018state and community\u2019 officials, but makes no mention of the federal government, the focus of much of Amazon\u2019s existing D.C. workforce.\u201d Bezos (who, let\u2019s not forget, personally owns The Washington Post) apparently already owns the largest home in DC, or will soon. The Post itself reported back in 2017 that Bezos had bought two mansions there, one of which he intended to turn into the largest in the city.  Business Insider has reported that of the 20 remaining HQ2 contenders believed to still be on Amazon\u2019s short list, three of those are in the DC metro area. Fun fact: Washington DC is the only metro area with that many contenders left on the short list. Also per BI, \u201cNorthern Virginia is attractive for tech firms due to its proximity to Data Center Alley, where 70% of the United States\u2019 internet traffic flows through. That means more efficiency and reliability, as well as cheaper power.\u201d People are starting to be so convinced DC is going to be the winning locale that we\u2019re already starting to see thinkpieces about whether or not Amazon will be good for the area.

The company plans to make a decision by Dec. 31, barring some huge upset, and once it's made, hiring in the anointed town will begin in 2019. Austin and Dallas got their Amazon visits at the beginning of March. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he believes either city would be a \"perfect fit\" for Amazon, touting his state's excellent workforce, low cost of living, reasonable regulation, low tax rate and ease of doing business.  Chicago hosted the Amazon team for two days the week of March 19. One blip in the process was a pre-tour graffiti clean-up blitz that mistakenly destroyed a piece of wall art by French street artist Blek le Rat on a building in the Logan Square area. It\u2019s across from Lincoln Yards, a 70-acre riverfront site that\u2019s one of Chicago\u2019s prime contenders for the Amazon placement.  Chicago was not above playing hardball. It hired actor William Shatner, aka Capt. Kirk, to narrate a video suggesting America's Second City for Amazon's Second Headquarters. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a serious Star Trek fan, so much so that he had a bit part in the movie Star Trek Beyond. Denver had a 10-person group tour the city the last week of January. Little has been revealed about the visit beyond word that the Amazon team took a ride on the light-rail train from the Denver airport into town, according to the Denver Post.  New York City and Newark are rumored to be gearing up for an Amazon foray in April, according to Bisnow, a local business news site. The Star-Ledger reported the trip was originally slated for the first week of March but weather \u2014 in fact, a blizzard \u2014 caused it to be rescheduled.  Both New York City and Newark, which are just 12 miles apart, are considered to be on the short list of finalists.   Philadelphia got a visit, but it's not exactly clear when Amazon came. Mayor Jim Kenney told the Philadelphia Inquirer only that the Seattle team came for about a day and a half, but wouldn't say when or what they did, beyond that they didn't meet directly with him. The Washington, D.C., area has three separate areas vying for the Amazon headquarters: Washington, D.C., itself, Montgomery County, Md., and Northern Virginia. All three got visits the first week of March. Both Virginia and Maryland are offering up cities near to D.C. Virginia suggests Alexandria and Arlington, while Maryland has focused on the White Flint area of North Bethesda, which is near a Metro station with a direct link to Washington, D.C. Washington, D.C., has been seen as a front-runner in the fight to get Amazon, for several reasons. One is its proximity to the federal government, which would give the Seattle company more of a hometown advantage as it fends off suggestions that the rapidly growing enterprise be tamed by regulation or taxation.  Another is simply that CEO Jeff Bezos already has a house there \u2014 though it\u2019s hardly just a house. The $23 million, 27,000-square-foot mansion used to be a museum and is the largest private home in the District of Columbia. It is within blocks of the homes of both Barack and Michelle Obama and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. The historic neighborhood, Kalorama, has long been home to diplomats and the power elite. As yet, there's no word of when other contenders, including Boston; Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Los Angeles; Miami; Nashville; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; and Toronto, will get their visits. \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/04/02/amazons-second-headquarters-search-hits-crunch-time-one-group-warns-its-race-bottom/473705002/"], [54637, "2018-04-28T17:29:53Z", [0.25, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-04-28T15:15:45Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [8663, "2018-04-27T13:31:24Z", [0.33, 0.0, 0.3, 0.37, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39089, "2018-04-27T13:09:15Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.1, 0.76, 0.0, 0.12], ""], [1333, "2018-04-27T11:55:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], "A preliminary construction and lease agreement that could help bring an Amazon Fulfillment Center to Oklahoma City was approved Thursday morning..\nDid I mention that OKC is only 2hrs from Benton Arkansas- Wal-Mart HQ?"], [1333, "2018-04-26T12:27:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.25, 0.0, 0.15], "Now I'm working on the premise that the Amazon HQ and new fulfillment center are tandem projects.

However, there have been independent evals of the possible sites by third parties, including Moodys and the NYT. Moody's top 4 were Austin at #1, followed by ATL, PHI, and NYC. The NYT ranked the top three according to Amazon's criteria and had Denver as the top city, followed by Boston and DC. Thus, I give a little boost to the central time zone and mountain time zone, and a discount to the pacific time zone, because there hasn't been much info about LA, and there is already a west coast HQ. I have a hunch that just due to pop density on the East Coast, as well as the nature of Amazon's business model, that they would want to locate themselves on the East Coast. Plus, both Denver and Austin are already hubs for startups, which could be a plus, but I think that Amazon would rather pick a city that it could define. Peering into the mind of Jeff Bezos, I suspect that he has an interest in building a city around his empire, like the Chinese or Google are doing, and I don't think you could do that reliably in Austin, Denver, NYC, DC, Boston, or LA, unless you located Amazon on the outskirts.

I'm not confident it reflects Amazon true strategic challenges. \n- My first thought was: their main challenge for the new HQ: attracting and retaining the right talents, especially in Computer Science, Robotics and Machine Learning/AI (San Francisco, NYC/Boston) -- I put aside the people in sales (especially a need for their B2B marketplace), ops, finance, etc. where the shortage isn't as big as the three specialities mentioned \n- Checking at their job webpage, I verified that their main shortage are people in Computer Science (2258 positions opened), so they'll need a city attractive for developers (ie: good tech ecosystem & universities) - https://www.amazon.jobs/fr/search?base_query=&loc_query=%25C3%2589tats-Unis&country=USA\n- The most attractive hubs for people working in tech are (Seattle excluded): \n> for robotic: San Francisco, San Jose, Boston, Washington DC, Pittsburgh - all in Eastern, Atlantic, or Newfoundland Time Zones - https://www.quora.com/Which-geographical-area-in-the-US-is-the-hub-of-robotics-jobs-internships\n> for ML/AI: California (San Francisco / Palo Alto / Cambridge), NYC/Boston & to a lesser extent Montreal - all in Eastern, Atlantic, or Newfoundland Time Zones \n> for CS : California (SF, Palo Alto, San Jose...), NYC/Boston, Seatle (all EAN TimeZones) and to a lesser extent Austin (Central), Raley (Eastern) & Madison (Central) // (https://techbeacon.com/10-best-cities-for-software-engineers ; http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/25-best-cities-to-be-programmer-2016-7/#no-9-portland-oregon-89374-17). I'd add Montreal/Toronto here as well but they are all in Eastern Time Zones so it wouldn't influence the choice. \n- If it would be another tech giants, I would at that point be much more betting on Eastern, Atlantic or Newfoundland Time Zones. Yet, Jeff Bezos has built a culture around customer satisfaction at the lowest cost possible. And there is always the tradeoff between quality of human capital and cost (tax incentive, affordability of life - thus wages). \n- Checking back the articles & seeing that they plan to hire 50k people, it cannot be only for top talents in robotics and AI (they can do it in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale & Cambridge where already are) \n- If I were looking for more affordable cities than the big tech hubs (checked moody's model for that) with very high human capital (in tech), my top 3 would be: Pittsburgh (Amazon already there - eastern), Raley (Eastern) & Austin (Central). \n- So I would overall bet on Easter (for California, NY/Boston, etc.) but keep a good probability on Austin, especially because it attracted other tech champions (Samsung & Apple, has a very influential tech event (SXSW) and a strong tech ecosystem, at a cost affordable and many other reasons --http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/amazon-hq2-could-be-austin-why-2017-10/) -- this sounds like a very Amazon-like choice. Yet it is one city against many other very good choices. - When I made a new check (through this article especially - https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html), I realized I had missed Denver & Boulder (Moutain Standard Time) even if they are not as much attractive compared to the other cities to date. I've increased a bit the probability of it. I didn't mention that much Pittsburgh either but it is in the Eastern Time Zone so it has not much influence on the probability. I feel my biggest risk is to have overstated the assumption that their main shortage were CS people, missed some other key competencies or other factors that they weight more than I would - focusing on people.

Next highest probability is allocated to CST time zone (23%), then PST/AlST/HAST time zone (12%), and lastly out of the US time zones MST time zone (8%). I predict there to be a equal minimal chance of 1% that Amazon will either locate its new HQ in another time zone or will not announce the new location before 1st of October 2018. My prediction is based on the following. Base rates: \u2022\tI used the Moody\u2019s model and data set that included the geographic variable to establish my first base rate. The data set can be downloaded from Moody\u2019s site.\no\tMoody\u2019s considered 65 cities as a possible location for AHQ2 \u2013 all other things equal there would be a 1/65 chance of any of these cities being nominated which averages to \u2248 1,54% per city. \no\tMoody\u2019s had also used numerous variables to calculate the most likely/suitable city for the AHQ2. I used these scores to calculate what percentage would equal to one score point of Moody\u2019s model. This came to \u2248 0,59% per point. Using this I calculated the percentage scores of all the cities, divided the cities according to their time zones and added up the cities percentage points in the time zones.\nhttps://www.economy.com/dismal/analysis/commentary/298321/Where-Amazons-Next-Headquarters-Should-Go/  \u2022\tAs my second base rate I used New York Time\u2019s article in which they also calculate the most likely city to receive the AHQ2 nomination. Here I devised my own scoring system in which every city got 1 point for meeting any of five NYT criteria (as a start each city on the list got 1 point for making it to the list) + added my own geography criteria (my assumption that Amazon would locate AHQ2 some distance away from the current Seattle HQ). In the geography variable all cities not in the PST time zone were given a 1 point while PST zone cities each received a 0. Per point percentage came to \u2248 0,67%. I then carried out same calculations as with the first data set.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html \u2022\tLastly I averaged the two base rates. Key Facts:\n\u2022\tAmazon has stated it will announce the location of its new HQ in 2018.\no\tThe likelihood of \u201eNO\u201c thus minimal (1%). Key Assumptions:\n\u2022\tI assume Amazon wants the other HQ to be located some distance from the Seattle HQ.\no\tGeography factored into both base rates.\n\u2022\tAmazon is not going to announce its HQ2 abroad \u2013 I assume it would be too much of a negative reaction especially with Trump\u2019s administration emphasizing bring jobs back to US.\no\tMinimal probability that AHQ2 would be located anywhere outside US thus outside the given US time zones.\no\tIn worst case I assume AHQ2 will be located either in Canada or Mexico \u2013 both still in North American time zones.  Key Indicators:\n\u2022\tPrior to announcing a winner, Amazon will announce time zone/region where it intends to locate its new HQ; announce a TOP 10/20/30 list of the locations it is considering locating its new HQ.

Denver is possible, and we can't rule out the possibility that this is a bait and switch to get tax breaks on new distribution centers. https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-many-places-amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-calls-home-1507204462\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/09/upshot/where-should-amazon-new-headquarters-be.html"], [43096, "2017-12-25T19:27:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.8, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [42667, "2017-12-25T18:46:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.0, 0.1], ""], [43077, "2017-12-25T15:44:16Z", [0.29, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.01], ""], [5157, "2017-12-25T03:46:02Z", [0.15, 0.39, 0.26, 0.15, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [38564, "2017-12-25T02:11:25Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.34, 0.33, 0.01, 0.0], "HI and AK cannot support it and there are decent cities in all those zones"], [42996, "2017-12-24T21:49:39Z", [0.45, 0.3, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42985, "2017-12-24T19:32:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "The states will offer it the best deal "], [42972, "2017-12-24T17:53:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42955, "2017-12-24T15:48:32Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.0, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42894, "2017-12-24T14:06:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [21884, "2017-12-24T05:50:29Z", [0.07, 0.07, 0.39, 0.4, 0.05, 0.02], ""], [42898, "2017-12-24T03:32:21Z", [0.05, 0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [42848, "2017-12-23T21:28:57Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42791, "2017-12-23T19:58:20Z", [0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], "Central makes sense."], [42824, "2017-12-23T16:42:30Z", [0.1, 0.15, 0.1, 0.55, 0.1, 0.0], "Amazon's market is better served having a HQ near another large area.
