According to @barhoom, there will be a special session starting on Tuesday through December. The language of both the rule and the Constitution specify \u201cregular session,\u201d and the only thing I can find about special sessions without working too hard is that no bill may be considered in one unless it\u2019s included in the call, which is easy to do. However, if this one is not in the call, it can\u2019t be passed in the special.  In some places there is a shorter dispensation for special sessions, but if Michigan has one I can\u2019t find it. (This does not mean it doesn\u2019t exist. I have never worked in the Michigan legislature and everyone I know who did is either dead or living in Florida now.)  Since the bill was amended at some point, according to the analysis, it is probably considered a new bill and so has to be in the body\u2019s possession for five days. Also can\u2019t find a definition of whether days is calendar days, business days, session days, or legislative days. These are not always the same\u2014in some states it is up to the body whether a day has started or ended, so you can rip through three or four legislative days in a couple of hours, but the next legislative day might take two weeks to run its course. In most states, a session day is just a calendar day when the chamber (or sometimes either chamber) has a floor session.  So, to cut this short for a change:  If the session starting Tuesday is a special, the bill must be included in the session call to be considered. If it is, it may have to sit around for up to five days of some sort before being voted on. After that it goes over to the House. I have not started to wade through the House rules yet, but I suppose I must sooner or later, as it is beginning to matter. They are likely quite similar on most of these points.  The result is this baby could be on Governor's desk by the first week in October. I have not checked the Constitution to see how many days the governor has to decide what to do, but it seems likely he\u2019ll sign it as soon as he sees it. It therefore seems increasingly probable that the patient will live. Bumping my number way up, but also checking the bill-status system daily from now on. This will cut deeply into my nap time.

Then calculated percentage of Ayes and Noes in voting for passing each committee instance  and also assigned weight compared to average. I used these weights to project future legislative time for each bill and compared it to remaining legislative times for each state, (deducing 15% for being electoral year). Did some more calculations, including a framework for comparing corporate liquidity (cash on hand) of companies interested in testing against State government S&P ratings, but I don't have the time to explain now.\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1592"], [691, "2016-08-18T16:11:34Z", [0.0], ""], [23006, "2016-08-18T15:46:18Z", [0.0], "timeframe too tight for government policy and laws to be adapted"], [15231, "2016-08-18T13:34:44Z", [0.45], ""], [28375, "2016-08-18T13:06:06Z", [0.0], "Recent accidents highlight that the technology isnt ready for a fully autonomous driving experience"], [28274, "2016-08-18T09:58:30Z", [0.26], "I realized that I need to factor in that some states' sessions are due to indefinite suspension and this would affect the probability of a bill to pass within the remaining period before suspensions.

It asks if any US state enact legislation that \"allows\" AV to operate on its public roads. Therefore, it might exclude those that have already enacted such laws, like CA, but later they enact additional bills that are mere slight amendments. However, for the sake of simplicity I decided to count such situations as resolving the question to \"yes\". Thinking about how to approach the problem, I find out it all boils down to the probability that any current bill would pass a legislation process and get enacted regardless the state. Therefore, the unit of measurement will not be the state but the bill. So I gathered all AV related bills and they could be found on these URLs:  http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Automated_Driving:_Legislative_and_Regulatory_Action  http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx#Introduced%202016 However, states that have their legislatures\u2019' sessions closed should not be counted in. Only those are still open, their sessions are on hold due to vacations, or those that have scheduled special sessions in the rest of the year will be considered. Additionally I neglected bills that request studies or mere definitions of VC without clear impact on permissibility on being on the road. This filters out bills and states to only 5 states and 12 bills. After limiting the scope of search, I looked into the factors that would affect the probability of any bill to successfully enacted (merit-based probability). I found a very helpful website that provides a statistical model based on satisfactory number of congressional bills and uses logistics regression that encompasses 18 factors. This is the URL:  https://www.govtrack.us/about/analysis#prognosis/factors I used this model to calculate the overall probability of a bill success regardless time.  Then I looked into each bill and assigned a relevant probability according to the stage where it is currently in (in which house and in which reading round - reading 1, 2 or 3). So bills at 3rd reading in the 2nd house (senate or assembly) have higher probability of passing than bills in 1st or 2nd reading round in the 1st house. This is a time-based probability.  Then I let the model run the calculations to find out the probability of the success of each bill (the probability based on its own merit * the probability of its progress in the senate/assembly houses).

Most legislation has been taking a couple years to pass or fail. check out the ncsl.org link below for all the good info on the legislation.   I need to do more research on the status of the Illinois bill. For now I'm forecasting 13% (below consensus) that legislation will pass in a state that does not already have legislation to allow these vehicles to operate.   http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx\nhttp://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&DocNum=3136&GAID=13&SessionID=88&LegID=89280"], [83, "2016-08-12T19:37:34Z", [0.75], "Increasing forecast:\nhttp://www.autonews.com/article/20160501/OEM11/160509998/why-michigan-wants-to-stay-in-the-drivers-seat-on-autonomous-vehicle\nCompetition to influence the future direction of autonomous vehicle regulation seem to be highly competitive."], [12879, "2016-08-12T19:26:47Z", [0.28], ""], [83, "2016-08-12T19:22:14Z", [0.5], "Michigan has already passed these types of laws:\nhttp://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577-318728--,00.html Test vehicles count:  Based on the questions specifics: \"Any legislation enacted allowing autonomous vehicles on public roads will resolve the question as \"yes,\" even if the legislation places restrictions on those autonomous vehicles (e.g., by limiting operation to certain roads or conditions, or only allowing operation for the purposes of research or testing).\" Starting at 50/50, autonomous driving vehicles are coming, the Tesla \"issues\" likely will not impact long range planning for further testing and development.
