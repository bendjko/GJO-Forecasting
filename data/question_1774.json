After listening to the oral arguments, Justice Sotomayor spoke about how the individual mandate was ruled unconstitutional in the original case. She said, why do you need us to rule this unconstitutional again? But she said a lot of things that didn't make sense. She made the argument that if someone didn't get health insurance when there was a tax, why would they be coerced to do so now in their is effectively no tax. This is a terrible argument for her to make for two reasons. Most importantly, in the original ACA case the Court ruled that the tax was not large enough to compel anyone to take action therefore it was constitutional. So for her to argue that a zero tax is less coercive would be inconsistent with the original case which said that the tax was not coercive to begin with. Secondly, there are all sorts of reasons why someone's individual position might change. maybe they were covered under their parents healthcare when there was a tax and now they have to get their own healthcare when there isn't a tax. Or they lost health insurance by losing a job. The justices talked about a CBO report that stated that the ACA would compel many thousands of people to get health insurance. I got the impression that many of the justices found that this report was suitable evidence that the ACA did compel people to get health insurance, and therefore the standing issue was resolved. I think Sotomayor will disagree with this, but I think it's very possible the court will rule there is standing, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and then sever it from the rest of the act."], [13432, "2021-01-28T22:54:09Z", [0.05], ""], [60948, "2021-01-27T17:14:32Z", [0.1], ""], [1333, "2021-01-26T14:14:05Z", [0.0], ""], [28899, "2021-01-26T11:08:56Z", [0.2], ""], [97993, "2021-01-18T21:27:59Z", [0.05], ""], [13657, "2021-01-18T15:08:01Z", [0.0], ""], [13657, "2021-01-18T15:07:53Z", [0.01], ""], [13657, "2021-01-18T15:06:19Z", [0.2], ""], [34959, "2021-01-18T04:45:58Z", [0.01], ""], [60948, "2021-01-17T16:58:20Z", [0.07], ""], [86663, "2021-01-14T06:39:23Z", [0.07], ""], [60948, "2021-01-13T14:18:24Z", [0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-01-12T07:20:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2021-01-09T16:30:35Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-01-09T12:03:33Z", [0.01], ""], [1078, "2021-01-08T23:48:34Z", [0.0], ""], [40584, "2021-01-08T00:58:50Z", [0.01], ""], [84880, "2021-01-06T23:20:46Z", [0.0], ""], [58508, "2021-01-05T14:57:52Z", [0.15], ""], [81187, "2021-01-04T23:03:02Z", [0.0], ""], [81187, "2021-01-04T23:02:47Z", [1.0], ""], [92863, "2021-01-04T19:40:41Z", [0.01], ""], [60948, "2021-01-04T17:15:34Z", [0.15], ""], [60948, "2020-12-26T23:38:31Z", [0.17], ""], [58508, "2020-12-26T02:40:32Z", [0.25], ""], [1333, "2020-12-25T16:40:28Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2020-12-25T10:53:17Z", [0.0], ""], [34959, "2020-12-22T15:02:46Z", [0.02], ""], [92863, "2020-12-22T10:12:14Z", [0.02], ""], [92863, "2020-12-21T14:17:44Z", [0.03], "When is this happening, anyone have an idea?"], [84880, "2020-12-19T05:22:00Z", [0.01], ""], [90433, "2020-12-18T18:24:29Z", [0.1], "Looks likely to stand Thank God."], [34959, "2020-12-18T03:58:57Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2020-12-17T14:33:49Z", [0.0], ""], [19127, "2020-12-16T22:28:06Z", [0.24], ""], [22689, "2020-12-15T18:21:47Z", [0.0], ""], [2965, "2020-12-15T01:31:11Z", [0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-12-14T14:08:42Z", [0.0], ""], [60948, "2020-12-13T19:55:20Z", [0.15], ""], [2965, "2020-12-12T14:56:36Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-12-12T12:08:20Z", [0.01], ""], [60948, "2020-12-12T10:16:08Z", [0.17], ""], [1333, "2020-12-09T16:08:46Z", [0.0], ""], [64357, "2020-12-09T15:54:13Z", [0.05], ""], [19127, "2020-12-08T14:19:33Z", [0.3], ""], [28899, "2020-12-08T11:36:01Z", [0.33], ""], [96318, "2020-12-08T08:47:59Z", [0.29], ""], [534, "2020-12-06T18:51:38Z", [0.05], ""], [60948, "2020-12-06T15:27:02Z", [0.15], ""], [32258, "2020-12-04T16:59:13Z", [0.0], ""], [34959, "2020-12-03T08:44:23Z", [0.1], ""], [40584, "2020-12-03T01:42:50Z", [0.15], ""], [91516, "2020-12-03T00:58:00Z", [0.25], "Two justices, Alito and Thomas, have already demonstrated their hostility to the ACA, but the Chief Justice remains convinced it was constitutional.

If it was legal as a tax, the idea that lowering the penalty to zero makes it more coercive and more of a command and that it's unconstitutional because it no longer raises revenue and therefore can't be considered a tax seems absurd. But court conservatives could be more open to that argument than me, though there did seem to be some skepticism in the questioning. But my main reason for dropping the likelihood is because most of the questions focused on standing and much less on the other issues. So I think there's a good chance the other questions aren't reached because the court rules the plaintiffs don't have standing.

Roberts found that the penalty had the characteristics of a tax. The circuit court latches on to one line in Roberts' opinion: \"This process yields the essential feature of any tax: it produces at least some revenue for the Government.\" Using that line they argue that a penalty of $0 no longer satisfies that component and therefore it's no longer a tax and is unconstitutional. I think Roberts will find this attempt to strike the rest of his reasoning by picking on this one line unconvincing. Seems absurd for it to be considered a tax at every value except for $0. The language and legislative history is still there, as well as Roberts own previous interpretation. Changing the value to $0 does not appear to invalidate, and to the contrary by changing the penalty to zero it essentially no longer constitutes a penalty in the first place and does not compel anyone to engage in commerce. Lastly, Roberts is big on interpreting laws charitably to uphold constitutionality. In his view Congress has as much say over how to interpret the constitutionality of laws as his branch does and therefore the judicial branch must avoid striking a law as unconstitutional unless all interpretations of it are unconstitutional. I don't think changing the penalty/tax from not $0 to $0 is going to make the mandate unconstitutional in his view.

(I can cite multiple examples of people paying $500 monthly for ACA marketplace plans before penalty of $0 whose monthly payments jumped to $1500 after penalty changed to $0 and then had to give up needed healthcare). This is not to discount the argument that people are being forced to sign up for services that they don\u2019t want or need.  However, I have seen firsthand dozens of individuals who were unhappy to have to purchase insurance only to be pleased with the overall outcome (being able to get a basic physical, labs, and health screenings w/o insurmountable fees and then having access to quality care near home for chronic conditions - in those who could not afford to adequately address health concerns before).   During a worldwide pandemic, the multiple problems with our healthcare system have been well highlighted.   No system is perfect, but I am currently banking on the fact that overall, no one wants to disrupt the system further at the present time when it is already highly chaotic and unorganized.

Recall that in NFIB vs Sebillus  scotus said the mandate was a tax b/c it raised revenue, and it was not coercive b/c it was a small amount (said the CJ with a six figured salary and a really big house).  So if the mandate-tax is now not revenue producing  is it still a tax? Maybe it is an ineffective attempt at coercion but still a coercive (and corrosive) attempt to force a consumer to enter a market which is unconstitutional.  It is red meat to the conservative justices.  They can declare the mandate is no longer a tax and stand on principle and effect nothing.\nI do not think stare decisis will stay the hand of the conservative justices. However, there is the question of standing which is not clear cut in my opinion.  I think the individual plaintiffs will be found not to have standing. I don't see the harm that a $0 mandate had on them. There's nothing to remedy. The states said they have standing because they encourage cost to verify employees have minimum required coverage. Which is a course that could get standing. But there seems to be a question if they ever provided such evidence in the initial court cases.

The real issue being debated in the court is whether the individual mandate is severable, in other words, does this invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act or just the individual mandate. And that's not the issue being posed by this question. This question is addressing something no one is contesting. This question would only resolve no for two reasons. First, if the supreme Court makes a ruling that neither side is arguing which is actually what it did in the original Affordable Care Act case by declaring the individual mandate a tax. Second would be if the Supreme Court does not answer this issue in 2020. As a little background, it might be helpful to review the original case. The individual mandate was very controversial because some people argued that the law should not force people to buy something. The United States Supreme Court side stepped the issue by declaring it a tax. They said that because the tax was not high enough to actually motivate everyone to actually get insurance, that it was not coercive. That left the question open that if the tax was actually raised so that it would actually motivate everyone to get insurance then perhaps it would be unconstitutional. Now that the tax has been lowered to zero that means there is no mandate and therefore the insurance companies are not being properly funded to be forced to accept pre-existing conditions. The prosecution, defense, and all the lower courts have agreed this invalidates the individual mandate. As an interesting side note, this actually affects the concept of a wealth tax. some conservatives argue that a wealth tax would be unconstitutional because it would be a direct tax outlawed by the US Constitution. however, in the original Affordable Care Act case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a tax is applied on only certain people under certain conditions that it is constitutional."], [88010, "2020-09-04T19:38:51Z", [0.05], ""], [28415, "2020-09-04T19:37:20Z", [0.13], ""], [74065, "2020-09-04T19:24:02Z", [0.0], "The court will find a way to not answer the question.
