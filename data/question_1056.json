Essentially, if Mark Zuckerberg ceases to be CEO, who will run Facebook? I think he may stay because the consequences of walking away seem too great, especially for the potential power of Facebook.

This independence policy shall apply prospectively so as not to violate any contractual obligations. If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair.\nSupporting Statement:\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been Board Chair since 2012. His dual-class shareholdings give him approximately 60% of Facebook's voting shares, leaving the board, even with a lead independent director, with only a limited ability to check Mr. Zuckerberg's power. We believe this weakens Facebook's governance and oversight of management. Selecting an independent Chair would free the CEO to focus on managing the Company and enable the Chairperson to focus on oversight and strategic guidance.\nThe Council of Institutional Investors argues:\nHaving an independent chair helps the board carry out its primary duty \u2014 to monitor the management of the company on behalf of its shareowners. A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board's oversight of management. Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.\nFacebook has resisted recent shareholder requests to separate these roles. In 2017, according to our calculations, a similar proposal received the support of 51% of the votes cast when excluding the shares of 13 executives and board members. However, the board has not acted on this important signal from its non-insider shareholders.\nGoogle, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, and Twitter have separate CEO and chairperson roles. More broadly, 59% of the S&P 1500 separated these roles as of April 2018.\nWe believe this lack of independent board Chair and oversight has contributed to Facebook missing, or mishandling, a number of severe controversies, increasing risk exposure and costs to shareholders. Examples from past years include:\n\u2022\nRussian meddling in U.S. elections\n\u2022\nSharing personal data of 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica\n\u2022\nData sharing with device manufacturers, including Huawei that is flagged by U.S. Intelligence as a national security threat\n\u2022\nProliferating fake news\n\u2022\nPropagating violence in Myanmar, India, and South Sudan\n\u2022\nDepression and other mental health issues, including stress and addiction\n\u2022\nAllowing advertisers to exclude black, Hispanic, and other \"ethnic affinities\" from seeing ads. In apologies, Mr. Zuckerberg has stated, \"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility.\" This broader view is what an independent Board Chair would provide, which we believe would benefit the company, its shareholders, and its global community of users."], [71836, "2019-04-14T19:51:22Z", [0.06], ""], [71837, "2019-04-14T19:50:46Z", [0.05], ""], [71811, "2019-04-14T19:41:36Z", [0.1], ""], [71834, "2019-04-14T19:37:26Z", [0.1], ""], [71816, "2019-04-14T18:57:57Z", [0.0], ""], [71814, "2019-04-14T18:49:02Z", [0.04], ""], [71744, "2019-04-14T18:36:41Z", [0.05], ""], [71808, "2019-04-14T18:18:43Z", [0.05], "Highly unlikely.

However, the likelihood of this ever happening appears to be very low given Zuckerberg's strategic efforts to keep hold of the company. He holds around 12 million Class A Facebook shares and 392 million Class B Facebook shares. This dual share system weighs Class B shares above those in Class B giving Zuckerberg himself around 53% of the voting rights for shareholders. This means any large decision that is made in the company is ultimately decided by Zuckerberg himself.

Only 10 CEOs of S&P 500 companies have been terminated since 2008.\n2) Chairman reaches the term limit for Board members.\n3) Chairman and/or CEO chooses to retire or resign - An average 50 of CEOs at S&P 500 companies have retired or resigned each year.\n4) Chairman and/or CEO agrees to share responsibilities.\n5) Chairman and/or CEO announces leave of absence - These are rare because boards do not like CEOs to take leaves of absence.\n6) Company ceases to exist. Starting Point: An average of 51 CEOs of S&P 500 companies transition each year. This turnover rate (10.2%) was my starting point. Zuckerberg has been CEO since the company was founded in 2004 (15 years), so he is in the 12th-percentile for longest tenured CEOs in the S&P500. Finally, I asked myself \"How could Mark Zuckerberg be removed from his position as Chairman and/or CEO?\"\n1) Shareholders vote to remove him as CEO and/or Chairman - 0% probability because Zuckerberg owns a majority voting share (~53.3%) of the company. This lowers probability to 10%.\n2) Zuckerberg reaches term limit as board member - 0% probability because, to my knowledge, there is no such term for Facebook. This does not change the probability.\n3) Zuckerberg retires - 41% of CEOs that transition each year retire. Mark has been portrayed as a self-motivated individual that seeks new ventures. At the age of 34, it is unlikely, but possible, that he might retire. Therefore, I think this reduces the probability from 10% to 9%.\n4) Zuckerberg resigns - 59% of CEOs that transition each year resign. I think this is the most likely scenario in which Zuckerberg transitions. Zuckerberg is known for his love of travel and trying new things. The mounting pressure due to recent scandals over user privacy could offer an opportunity for him to get out. I give this a 10% chance, which reduces the probability from 9% to 3%.\n6) Zuckerberg announces a co-Chairman/CEO or takes leave of absence- Zuckerberg has consistently shown that he wants sole ownership of Facebook. In addition, it is very rare for a CEO/Chairman to take leave of absence. 0% change in probability.\n7) Facebook ceases to exist - 0% chance before August 1st."], [68046, "2019-03-20T11:03:46Z", [0.05], "Too much power and we have seen the recent loss of senior executives who challenged Mark"], [62808, "2019-03-20T06:54:09Z", [0.02], ""], [66854, "2019-03-19T23:30:03Z", [0.05], ""], [65097, "2019-03-19T20:11:43Z", [0.1], ""], [37852, "2019-03-19T19:54:00Z", [0.05], ""], [11885, "2019-03-19T18:38:23Z", [0.03], ""], [66338, "2019-03-19T16:33:47Z", [0.05], ""], [68031, "2019-03-19T12:32:40Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2019-03-19T10:52:36Z", [0.02], ""], [67996, "2019-03-18T23:41:53Z", [0.01], ""], [28563, "2019-03-18T20:51:51Z", [0.02], ""], [67042, "2019-03-18T15:14:42Z", [0.1], ""], [63914, "2019-03-18T14:46:22Z", [0.55], "Depending on  how he handles the shootings crisis, he may now decide that he does not want to be  so prominent, or his investment advisors may recommend to save the value of FB stock which is most of his wealth, that he step back.

That equates to 10 companies (net) a year moving away from this structure. We have 7 months to August, so you'd expect c.6 in that time. That is 1.2% of the S&P 500. This feels like a sensible base rate. I don't know why those companies or what type of companies enacted these changes though.\n3) Facebook is a controlled company. c.120 of the S&P 1500 (8%) are like this. I'd conclude that the chances are virtually zero that this would happen unless Zuckerberg wanted it to or felt obliged due to outside forces. I have not found any examples of shareholders successfully proposing a change to a controlled company.\n4) Proposals are made annually to change the shareholder structure to reduce Zuckerberg's voting power indicating some unrest/pressure. From 2014 to 2017 these proposals have received between 17% & 20% of all votes. One AGM occurs between now and the end of this question (end of May). \n5) We are then reliant purely on government or extreme external pressure to force a change (or Zuckerberg changing his own mind i.e. wanting to retire) \n5) I would say it is vastly more likely that the majority of the 10 annual changes of this nature occur in non-controlled companies. That would mean that the probability is potentially closer to 0% than 1% (can't do to 1dp here). I don't want to put zero as that suggests literally no chance.\n6) A catalyst for change would need to be seismic. The scandals the company suffered in 2017 were pretty seismic and yet no change has been forthcoming. \n7) I am not aware of any immediate deadlines for impending investigations into the company specifically that are likely to result in government intervention (incl. anti-trust) before this question ends. There could be more revelations re: Russia but my sense is everyone already assumes FB is guilty of everything under the sun - I am not sure sentiment could get worse (perhaps naively).\n8) I did find one instance of Zuckerberg not getting his way as regards corporate governance. In September 2017 he wanted to reclassify share classes to allow him to sell more shares to fund charity work without ceding any power. Zuckerberg backed down after a lawsuit was threatened. However, Zuckerberg also said that the performance of the share price meant that this reclassification was no longer necessary and he was able to make the donations he wanted to for the next 20 years without impacting on his control of the business (or level of donations). The share price in September 2017 was c.$170, 13% higher than today's $150 (27 January 2019) so not materially different. In conclusion, I would forecast the probability at 1%, below the base rate I established due to its controlled status. I could not find anything that suggests I should move this up materially other than the fact that it is established as a question in the media. The timeframe is also very short for this question and so the likelihood of the sort of catalyst required to enact the change is very low in my view."], [67099, "2019-01-27T08:43:12Z", [0.15], "He is still young and actively involved"], [56232, "2019-01-27T03:21:38Z", [0.0], ""], [56, "2019-01-26T23:08:47Z", [0.02], ""], [41922, "2019-01-26T20:24:34Z", [0.1], "Interesting story how Facebook was earning money on minors without their parents knowledge: \nhttps://www.revealnews.org/article/facebook-knowingly-duped-game-playing-kids-and-their-parents-out-of-money/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\n\u201cFacebook made clear that game developers should let children spend money even without their parents\u2019 permission.\u201d\nMore news like this and Zuckerberg will agree to share blame with someone else..."], [54996, "2019-01-26T09:59:01Z", [0.25], ""], [67085, "2019-01-26T05:47:37Z", [0.1], ""], [67083, "2019-01-26T02:19:47Z", [0.1], "I don\u2019t see why they would.

But, with mounting pressure on Mark Zuckerberg, there is an increasing likelihood that he will cease to be CEO or Chairman of Facebook in 2019. \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/why-mark-zuckerberg-wont-step-down-as-facebook-chairman.html"], [63450, "2018-12-14T01:18:47Z", [0.5], ""], [62045, "2018-12-13T22:07:31Z", [0.65], ""], [63589, "2018-12-13T22:00:10Z", [0.08], ""], [63589, "2018-12-13T21:47:07Z", [0.08], ""], [15680, "2018-12-13T19:58:49Z", [0.08], ""], [58851, "2018-12-13T19:50:29Z", [0.55], ""], [30194, "2018-12-13T19:06:57Z", [0.25], ""], [30194, "2018-12-13T18:59:11Z", [0.25], ""], [63498, "2018-12-13T18:25:07Z", [0.2], ""], [6079, "2018-12-13T18:21:47Z", [0.35], ""], [63225, "2018-12-13T18:09:36Z", [0.06], ""], [62510, "2018-12-13T17:45:35Z", [0.35], ""], [601, "2018-12-13T17:40:35Z", [0.15], ""], [61987, "2018-12-13T16:59:42Z", [0.1], ""], [61537, "2018-12-13T16:50:49Z", [0.15], "I give it a higher than I would like, Mark MUST take this step!!!!"], [61893, "2018-12-13T16:39:26Z", [0.02], ""], [62462, "2018-12-13T16:28:10Z", [0.0], "He controls all the voting rights"], [61930, "2018-12-13T16:23:17Z", [0.0], "this is his baby"], [56400, "2018-12-13T16:15:48Z", [0.35], ""], [62423, "2018-12-13T15:47:26Z", [0.1], ""], [62243, "2018-12-13T15:40:57Z", [0.05], ""], [44963, "2018-12-13T15:40:25Z", [0.1], ""], [62291, "2018-12-13T15:23:54Z", [0.05], "Multi-class voting structure at Facebook gives Zuckerberg full control and makes forced changes very difficult."], [61273, "2018-12-13T15:19:15Z", [0.15], ""], [62069, "2018-12-13T15:15:36Z", [1.0], ""], [62069, "2018-12-13T15:15:04Z", [0.0], ""], [62039, "2018-12-13T07:34:45Z", [0.2], "Overall unlikely, but there remains some possibility that it happens with continuing scrutiny over the existing business practices."], [33789, "2018-12-13T06:07:04Z", [0.04], "I think Zuckerberg\u2019s 53.3% voting rights is a strong factor to consider, per @Raahul-Kumar https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/794996"], [33789, "2018-12-13T06:00:03Z", [0.04], ""], [21981, "2018-12-13T02:14:34Z", [0.93], "Mark Zuckerberg has commented to this.
