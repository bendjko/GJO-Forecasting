The U.S. Treasury went on to note that possible penalties for U.S. citizens could mean up to 30 years in prison or fines of up to US$5 million. In the case of financial institutions, the fines could go up to US$10 million. In coordination with the U.S. Treasury pronouncements, Venezuela\u2019s opposition media have supplemented the U.S. threats with \u201canonymous statements\u201d supposedly implying that creditors are not planning to participate in the Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas allegedly on account of lack of comfortable facilities for the investors and fears about violence in Venezuela\u2019s capital. Along with news of this latest U.S. threat against Venezuela, international financial media also reported that on Nov. 8 a creditor of PDVSA\u2019s 2017 bonds asked the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to determine whether the oil company had fallen into non-payment which would activate insurance payouts for credit non-compliance. The Venezuelan authorities announced on Nov. 3 the start of the procedure to pay US$1.1 billion in capital and interest on the 2017 bond that expired on Nov. 2. The ISDA stated that \u201cthe 2017 bonds issued by the reference entity (PDVSA) expired on Nov. 2, 2017, with a payment of the expired principal. Following the end of the grace period for claiming non-payment insurance, the principal has not been received.\u201d Now ISDA members need to vote on whether or not to accept the creditor\u2019s question about non-compliance and then discuss how to respond to it.

I get the sense from the reporting I can find that they perceive default to be a decisive step towards losing control of the finances and main assets of the country which will translate to them being removed one way or another in fairly short order.  Their debtholders don't want default which would lead to immediate impairment of their assets. They don't want refineries, tankers and oil. They want coupon payments.

In one way, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s announcement late Thursday that Venezuela will seek to restructure its debt is hardly a shocker. The country is racked by political, social and economic crises: the International Monetary Fund thinks gross domestic product will fall 12% this year after contracting 16.5% in 2016, while inflation next year could top 2,000%. Yields on a Bloomberg Barclays index of dollar-denominated Venezuelan bonds have been north of 20% since late 2014 after the price collapse of oil, which accounts for 95% of the country\u2019s exports according to Standard & Poor\u2019s. For investors, the combination of extremely high yields and the Venezuelan government\u2019s determination to service its debt, even at the cost of crushing imports of vital goods, has generated big returns. For some, that determination had almost become an article of faith: since Venezuela hadn\u2019t defaulted, it would continue not to do so. But U.S. sanctions that effectively prevented Venezuela from raising new debt appear to have bitten. Now there is a great deal of uncertainty (para. 1-2). But any restructuring is set to be fearsomely complex. Holders of some $64 billion in bonds issued by the government and PDVSA may be pitted against bilateral creditors including China and Russia, where economic considerations will be combined with political and diplomatic motives; the total amount of debt is pegged at between $100 billion and $150 billion, according to Exotix Capital, a brokerage. Low bond prices may have allowed investors to build up stakes large enough in some securities to block restructuring, echoing complications both Greece and Argentina faced with holdout creditors (para. 4). And creditors might not even be willing to agree to a restructuring with Mr. Maduro in power, since a drastic economic overhaul is needed: in its absence, it is impossible even to determine what kind of debt might be sustainable. Support from the IMF seems indispensable, but Venezuela hasn\u2019t undergone a regular annual consultation with the Fund since 2004. The U.S. sanctions may make it extremely difficult to affect any restructuring that involves newly issued debt, and PDVSA has extensive commercial links with the U.S (para. 4-5). Barley, B.

Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday he would seek restructuring of sovereign debt, but his government will still transfer funds for a $1.1 billion principal payment on bonds from Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-run oil producer. While this means there may not be an immediate impact on PDVSA\u2019s obligation to repay Rosneft with oil deliveries, the move increases doubts about the arrangement, said Alexander Burgansky, an oil analyst at Renaissance Capital. \u201cIt may be increasingly more difficult for Rosneft to see these funds returned, in case of Venezuela default,\u201d Burgansky said by email. \u201cThis is why in our valuation model for Rosneft we have already conservatively written off these amounts\u201d (para. 1-3).

(PDVSA).  This is the most recent U.S. government action to ratchet up sanctions against Venezuela in response to President Nicolas Maduro's efforts to expand his power and suppress his political opposition.  Summary The sanctions do not generally bar transactions with the government of Venezuela or PDVSA.  They instead take a more targeted approach \u2013 similar to the U.S. sectoral sanctions against Russia \u2013 by prohibiting specific types of dealings (mostly financial transactions) in order to increase pressure on the ruling regime.  The U.S. government simultaneously offered some relief by carving out transactions with PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary CITGO Holding, Inc. (\"CITGO\"), food- and medicine-related transactions, and certain dealings in existing bonds.  It also has provided a 30-day wind-down period for contracts that are now prohibited. Although U.S. persons can continue to engage in most commerce with Venezuela, particularly with entities that are not owned or controlled by the government, it is becoming increasingly complicated to do so.  These latest sanctions are an added layer on top of the blocking sanctions already in place against the country's president Nicolas Maduro, the vice president, the president of PDVSA, and other high profile government and commercial officials.  Below is an overview of this latest round of sanctions, followed by practical considerations for companies with U.S. ties that do business in Venezuela. 1.          New Executive Order and General Licenses Highlights of the August 24 Executive Order include the following. U.S. persons are restricted from dealing in: new debt of PDVSA with a maturity exceeding 90 days;\nnew debt with a maturity exceeding 30 days, or new equity, of the government of Venezuela (other than debt of PDVSA; this provision, thus, includes new equity of PDVSA);\nexisting bonds already issued by the government of Venezuela (unless excepted \u2013 see discussion below);\ndividend payments or other distributions of profits to the government of Venezuela from any entity it owns or controls.  This would prohibit payment of dividends by CITGO to the Venezuelan government, as well as participation by U.S. persons, such as financial institutions, in the payment of such dividends; and\nany other type of security purchased from the government of Venezuela (including equity securities issued by a non-sanctioned party but purchased from the Government of Venezuela).\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") has issued the following General Licenses (\"GLs\"), which provide authorization to engage in certain activities that otherwise would be prohibited by the Order: Wind-down Period.  GL 1 provides a 30-day wind-down period in which U.S. persons may bring existing dealings covered by the Order to a close.  However, GL 1 excludes from its scope activities relating to dividend payments or profit distributions to the government of Venezuela, which must be terminated immediately.  Persons relying on GL 1 must report to OFAC within 10 days describing their transactions.\nExemption for CITGO. GL 2 authorizes U.S. persons to continue dealing in new debt, equity, and other securities of PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary CITGO and any of its own subsidiaries.  GL 2 does not, however, authorize transactions with CITGO where other Venezuelan government entities also are involved, payments of dividends or profits to the government of Venezuela, or dealings in new bonds issued by CITGO.\nExemption for Previously Issued Bonds.  GL 3 permits U.S. persons to deal in limited categories of bonds, including: certain previously issued bonds that are specifically listed in GL 3, as well as any preexisting bonds issued by U.S. entities owned or controlled by the government of Venezuela, for example CITGO.\nHumanitarian Exemption.  GL 4 allows U.S. persons to participate in financing, including new debt that otherwise would be prohibited, for transactions involving the supply from the United States or by a U.S. person of agricultural commodities, medicines, medical devices and parts and components therefor.\n2.          OFAC Guidance OFAC also published a list of Frequently Asked Questions (\"FAQs\") on the Order and related authorizations.  Many of the new FAQs provide similar guidance to that issued in connection with OFAC's sectoral sanctions against Russia, concerning how to interpret the restrictions on dealing with new debt and equity of sanctioned parties.  In particular, OFAC again has made clear that it takes a broad view in defining debt and equity: \"The term debt includes bonds, loans, extensions of credit, loan guarantees, letters of credit, drafts, bankers acceptances, discount notes or bills, or commercial paper. The term equity includes stocks, share issuances, depositary receipts, or any other evidence of title or ownership.\" OFAC's Venezuela FAQs are available in an un-numbered format as a standalone document online at: https://www.treasury.gov/resou... Also similar to the Russia sectoral sanctions, OFAC's FAQs emphasize that the debt restrictions apply only to scenarios where the government of Venezuela (or PDVSA) is the borrower.  For example, U.S. persons are not restricted from dealing in new debt where the government of Venezuela is lending to, providing underwriting for, or issuing, advising or confirming a letter of credit for, a non-sanctioned third party.  The FAQs also clarify that the Order does not prohibit a U.S. person from engaging in transactions necessary to exit or replace its participation in a pre-existing long-term loan facility extended to the Government of Venezuela, as this would not constitute dealing in new debt. 3.          Practical Considerations These new sanctions, combined with the existing blocking sanctions against specific high profile individuals in Venezuela, create a complex patchwork of sanctions that must be complied with by U.S. companies, as well as companies that have U.S. ties, such as involvement of U.S. persons in management, U.S. sources of financing or U.S. dollar transactions.  Below are some practical measures to consider as companies evaluate their Venezuela business strategies. Companies that sell products to the government of Venezuela, PDVSA, or other government-owned businesses should consider whether their standard sales terms might include the issuance of credit for periods of time that exceed the restricted maturity periods for those entities.  U.S. persons could not allow repayment longer than 90 days for goods or services provided to PDVSA.\nU.S. persons that remain involved in pre-existing long-term credit facilities extended to the government of Venezuela should ensure that the repayment terms for all newly negotiated drawdowns or disbursements from the facility do not run afoul of the sanctions.\nThere is a need for heightened due diligence on the parties to transactions in Venezuela, including looking behind the direct parties to know who is actually benefitting from or executing the business deal.   While the Order does not prohibit extending credit to non-sanctioned parties for the purpose of purchasing goods or services from the government of Venezuela, it is important to confirm that the government of Venezuela is not the indirect borrower.\nFurther, under the targeted blocking sanctions already in place, U.S. persons may not engage in transactions where a blocked individual is involved, even if the counter-party is not itself blocked.  On February 13, 2017, OFAC issued FAQ #505 advising that, although blocking of a government official does not mean that transactions with the Venezuelan government generally are prohibited:  \"U.S. persons should be cautious in dealings with the government to ensure that they are not engaged in transactions or dealings, directly or indirectly, with an SDN, for example by entering into contracts that are signed by an SDN, entering into negotiations with an SDN, or by processing transactions, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the SDN, absent authorization or an applicable exemption.\" \nThis guidance would apply, for example, to transactions that are permissible with the government of Venezuela or with PDVSA, but where an individually blocked person would need to be involved in negotiating or signing the deal.\nConclusion Given the involvement of the government and individual members of the Maduro regime throughout most major aspects of the Venezuelan economy, the risks of inadvertently running into one of these parties in a business transaction are high.  This increases the risks for U.S. companies and financial institutions doing business in Venezuela.  Companies with U.S. ties that operate in Venezuela need to implement a robust approach to due diligence.  Also, given the increasing political conflict in that country, companies might consider how to plan their operations going forward with the understanding that sanctions may continue to escalate.\"\nBefore ebitda\nMy analysis on a back of hand envelope"], [31571, "2017-11-03T08:24:25Z", [1.0], ""], [5386, "2017-11-03T07:55:27Z", [0.2], ""], [5386, "2017-11-03T07:48:01Z", [0.6], ""], [23234, "2017-11-03T05:51:20Z", [0.3], "can't make up my mind...

In a televised address late Thursday, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced plans to make a $1.1 billion principal payment Friday for a bond issued by state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. that was due Nov. 2. \u201cWe will continue to meet our obligations,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. He added that following Friday\u2019s payment, he would seek a voluntary restructuring of the country\u2019s remaining debt. Estimates of Venezuela\u2019s total outstanding debt vary, with some analysts putting the figure between $100 billion and $150 billion (para. 1-4). \u201cGiven U.S. sanctions and the policies of the current government, it\u2019s not clear whether there is a clear path forward other than for the government to seek to keep PdVSA\u2019s and the republic\u2019s assets beyond the reach of its creditors,\u201d said Richard Cooper, a senior partner in the restructuring group at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton (para.9). Investors have been bracing for a default, and the Venezuela portion of a benchmark emerging-market bond index, the J.P. Morgan EMBI Global Diversified, is down nearly 5% this year through Wednesday. But over the past few years, bondholders have been rewarded with some of the best returns in emerging markets as Venezuela has continued to pay its debts. Venezuelan bonds rallied after PdVSA said Oct. 27 that it would pay the $842 million in principal due that day. Bondholders and analysts say the country and PdVSA have fallen behind on several interest payments in recent weeks, which have a 30-day grace period. But there is no grace period for the principal payment in Venezuelan bonds, according to bond documents, meaning a delay could lead to a default. If PdVSA misses Thursday\u2019s interest payment for its maturing bond, that adds up to $826 million in missed interest payments, according to an estimate from Nomura Securities International (para.9-12).

The announcement came at the deadline for a $1.2 billion payment by the state oil company on a maturing bond, which Mr. Maduro said his government would instead deliver on Friday (para. 1-2). Given the sanctions, however, it remained unclear how Mr. Maduro intended to restructure the government\u2019s debt (para.7). \u201cThere\u2019s no way to restructure under existing U.S. sanctions, but the government may be hoping that bond holders now pressure the Trump administration to create an exemption to the sanctions,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, director for Latin America at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm (para.7- 8). There was no grace period for the loan payment due on Thursday, and it remained unclear how investors would react to the failure of the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, to make the payment on time (para. 10). Venezuela has a $140 billion external debt, most of which was borrowed in recent years when oil prices were more than $100 a barrel. The collapse of oil prices three years ago forced Venezuela into a crisis, and experts have been predicting that a default is nearly certain unless oil prices recover quickly to over $75 a barrel \u2014 well above current levels (para. 23). With more debt payments due in the coming months, the government and Pdvsa are offering leasing deals to Russian and Chinese companies to transfer operational control of one or two major refineries, according to Argus, an energy and commodity news service (para. 23-24).

Many analysts expect the country to default on its debt, particularly as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government faces U.S. sanctions that aim to block the government\u2019s ability to finance itself. Here\u2019s a look at the state of Venezuela\u2019s economy and finances. Venezuela has the world\u2019s highest inflation, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to reach 653% this year. The country has been ravaged by shortages of food and medicine, and months of protests that cost more than 120 lives. As Mr. Maduro has consolidated power, the opposition has been weakened and divided. The government and state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA, together owe billions of dollars in principal and interest payments in the coming months, including $1.2 billion due Thursday.

The suspense over whether the money would arrive in time to avoid a default reflected the concerns that remain about Venezuela\u2019s ability to pay its debts, particularly with $1.2 billion due Thursday on a maturing bond for PdVSA that also has no grace period (para. 3). The South American country is stretched for cash with prices for oil, its main export, still at half the level of three years ago. The country has slashed food and medicine imports and continued to pay bondholders, but a lack of transparency around Venezuela\u2019s finances has made it difficult to determine whether and from where the money will come (para.2-4). \u201cThe clear signals of cash-flow stress should only reaffirm fears of worsening cash-flow stress,\u201d she said (para. 6). PdVSA didn\u2019t specify if it would make the interest payment that also was due Oct. 27 and that has a 30-day grace period (para. 8). Some investors in the bonds said a clearinghouse that was designated to distribute the payment told them that the funds would arrive in bank accounts on Thursday.

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the trustee on the notes maturing in 2020, has been telling investors that it won\u2019t provide any information about the status of their funds until it issues a statement in the coming days -- potentially today or tomorrow -- according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the conversations were private. Tom Hoagwood, a spokesman for MUFG, declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate for the bank to discuss any correspondence it has with Petroleos de Venezuela SA bondholders. While PDVSA said on the due date that the $842 million payment had been sent, capping days of speculation about whether the oil producer would default, investors haven\u2019t seen the money in their accounts. There\u2019s been no communication on the part of company or government officials since they said last week that they made the payment \u201cdespite the illegal and illegitimate sanctions\u201d imposed on the country by the U.S. In August, the Trump administration blocked the purchase of new debt or equity issued by Venezuela and PDVSA, but there are no current restrictions on the trading of almost all existing debt. Questions surrounding the status of the payment are putting in doubt whether PDVSA will make a $1.1 billion principal payment due Thursday. The bonds maturing on that date have fallen 1.8 cents on the dollar this week to 94.18 cents. The 2020 bonds, which rallied Friday on reports PDVSA would pay, have fallen 2.2 cents this week as investors questioned whether the money would arrive.  The principal payments on the bonds don\u2019t have grace periods. Ratings companies haven\u2019t issued any statements regarding whether the oil company is technically in default. On Oct. 20, S&P Global Ratings said it would lower PDVSA\u2019s CCC- rating to selective default if the company failed to pay its bonds.

Once obscure and little noted, the break-even number has become an obsession for investors in oil giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM 0.29% , BP BP 1.16% PLC and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.14% as crude prices stay mired between $50 and $60 a barrel. At its simplest, the metric represents the oil price that a company needs to generate enough cash so it can cover its capital spending and dividend payouts. Brent crude was trading at just below $60 a barrel this week, down from over $114 in June 2014. BP says its break-even was $47 a barrel in the first half of the year, and the company is targeting between $35 and $40 a barrel by 2021, assuming prices stay about where they are today. Overall, Europe\u2019s biggest oil companies have cut break-evens to around $50 a barrel, according to Barclays .

Constitutional rule is being shunted in favor of new dictatorial powers for the ruling elite and, day by day, the Maduro government is dismantling the last vestiges of democratic principles and institutions. Sunday's local elections are the latest example of how far the government has moved from democracy. In a shocking result, the government captured 17 of 23 governorships. The opposition parties, which were widely expected to perform strongly, denounced the results as a \"massive electoral fraud.\" Against this bleak background, the global capital markets are providing the critical lifeline of liquidity and financial support to an increasingly totalitarian and repressive Maduro government. Three recent financing deals connect the dots between the capital markets and the strengthening of totalitarianism in Venezuela: In March, Venezuela received a $300 million loan from the hedge fund Fintech Advisory, backed by $1.3 billion of Venezuelan bonds.\nIn May, Goldman Sachs Asset Management went even bigger, purchasing $2.8 billion notional value of bonds directly from Venezuela's central bank, just as the government was dismantling democratic institutions, intensifying the crackdown on political opposition, and diverting even more resources from imports critical to maintaining a functioning society (para 1-6).

The Paraguana Refining Center, home to the Amuay and Cardon refineries along Venezuela\u2019s western coast, has reduced output repeatedly in recent months, contributing to intermittent fuel shortages in the South American OPEC nation. PDVSA had planned for Paraguana to process 385,000 bpd this month, according to internal company documents seen by Reuters. But it is currently operating at 34 percent of capacity and output is likely to come in well below the October target. The complex had been operating at 42 percent of capacity in August.

The suspension was triggered when PDVSA missed a payment for use of NuStar's Statia facility on the island of St. Eustatius, according to company documents viewed by Reuters. \"We should not load this cargo,\" wrote NuStar Vice President James Calvert in response to a loading request, according to one document. NuStar's refusal to retrieve the oil over what amounts to nearly a year's worth of monthly fees shows how recurring legal and trade disputes are disrupting PDVSA's ability to deliver its oil to foreign customers, which generate more than 90 percent of the country's export revenue. Shipping delays and quality concerns also are jeopardizing the OPEC-member country's crude sales, the lifeblood of its troubled economy. The suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners over a Bahamas storage facility.

The quality issues stem from shortages of chemicals and equipment to properly treat and store the oil, resulting in shutdowns and slowdowns at PDVSA production facilities, along with hurried transporting to avoid late deliveries, the sources said. U.S. refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) canceled at least eight crude cargoes because of poor oil quality in the first half of the year and demanded discounts on other deliveries, according to the PDVSA documents and employees from both firms. The canceled shipments - amounting to 4.4 million barrels of oil - had a market value of nearly $200 million. Another key buyer of Venezuelan crude - India\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), operator of the world\u2019s largest refinery - has repeatedly complained about oil quality, a PDVSA employee told Reuters. State-run firm China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) also complained earlier this year about excessive water levels in oil cargoes, a former PDVSA employee said. The deterioration of PDVSA crude is the latest symptom of the firm\u2019s ill-maintained production infrastructure, and it threatens to accelerate an already severe cash crisis at a time when Venezuela is hoarding dollars to pay some $3.4 billion to bondholders in the next few weeks.

The nation's state-owned oil giant, Petroleos de Venezuela, SA, has two major bond payments totaling about $2 billion coming due in the next two weeks. While the market expects the company, better known as PDVSA, to avoid default, the missed payments have rattled investors and raised fresh questions about how long embattled President Nicolas Maduro's regime might last. \"You're cutting close to the edge of not enough money in the checking account to pay the bills,\" said Ray Zucaro, chief investment officer at RVX Asset Management, an asset manager specializing in emerging and frontier markets. Last week, Venezuela missed five coupon payments totaling nearly $350 million tied to the debt of PDVSA, the government and the utility Electricidad de Caracas. That stoked a minor sell-off in a number of outstanding bonds. As for the upcoming payments, the first is due next Friday. The price of that bond dipped from a one-year high of $86.80 last week to $83.48 on Monday. It has rallied from a 12-month low of $62.50 on Aug. 1. PDVSA needs to pay $841 million in principal, plus interest, on that bond. It's a critical moment for Venezuela because a default is seen as hastening Maduro's demise. Making matters worse, the collateral against the bond is Citgo, PDVSA's Houston-based refining and retail subsidiary. The following week, on Nov. 2, a nearly $1.2 billion PDVSA bond is maturing. Total outstanding obligations for 2017 are about $3.4 billion, and there's no grace period for the two biggest payments. As Venezuela's economic and political crisis worsens, foreign reserves have dwindled to just $9.9 billion. But analysts and money managers say more than half of that could be in gold and illiquid assets. The market currently puts the odds of a Venezuelan default at 15 percent, according to an analysis by RVX Asset Management, but Zucaro said he believes the chances are closer to 40 percent. The environment is deteriorating, he said, as Venezuela's latest election results are being questioned and as sanctions on the country expand to include measures that prevent it from raising new funds (para 1-9).

Fewer oil providers are willing to sell cargoes to Citgo on open credit, instead requiring prepayment or bank letters of credit to supply its 749,000-barrel-per-day refining network, the sources said. Two sources at Canadian oil suppliers said their companies are no longer allowed to trade with Citgo directly, and have begun selling cargoes through third parties to avoid the credit risk. Citgo's three US, refineries, one each in Illinois, Texas and Louisiana, account for about 4 per cent of domestic fuel capacity. They are major suppliers of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. If financial troubles raise the cost of obtaining crude, its profits would be squeezed, making the company less competitive. Citgo had remained immune from its parent's straits until this year. But US sanctions levied in recent months against Venezuelan officials, PDVSA executives and the country's debt issuance have deterred banks and suppliers from extending even routine credit, the sources said. Citgo's main crude supplier is Venezuela, but the company also buys US and foreign oil. It has told some providers they can charge more to reflect the added credit risk. \"We are now more conservative when dealing with PDVSA or any of its units,\" said an executive from a trading firm with a long term business relationship with PDVSA. \"Banks that have refused to provide credit have a very rational thinking, they don't want to be exposed to sanctions. It does not take too much to have banks nervous,\" he added.

That is still the question. Willingness to pay is one thing. Ability is something entirely different. And on Friday, investors holding Venezuelan government dollar bonds will get a sense of the urgency there. Venezuela's government owes $185 million on their 2027 bond. So far, and with no loss of irony here, the anti-imperialist, Yankee-Go-Home ruling Socialist United party (PSUV) has a record of reaffirming the government's willingness to pay its foreign lenders, with interest payments of $3.6 billion made this year as of September. American and European investors, including Goldman Sachs, are still getting paid high yield for Venezuelan super-duper junk bonds (para 1-2). Venezuela also owes another $1.96 billion in October and November, with $1 billion due by Nov. 2. To put that into perspective, between the roughly $4 billion it's spent on interest payments and the $1 billion it owes in less than 8 weeks, Venezuela would have forked over the equivalent of roughly half of its central bank's foreign currency reserves paying foreign lenders. Something's got to give. If Venezuela continues to service its coupon payments, then it makes the amortization payments appear as less of a burden, thinks Siobhen Morden, managing director, Nomura Securities. \"What are the options on servicing external debt through year end? Venezuela has remained current for longer than most believed was possible. We are concerned about the fourth quarter,\" she says. Their cash flow is increasingly dry, and financing options are more complicated due to U.S. sanctions. Maduro really will need ruble and yuan finance.

However, in this case, with Russia being Maduro's ally, I expect Zero Hedge to carry Putin's water, er, oil. Currently, Zero Hedge is continuing to assert that that there is no default looming before the forecast horizon.  In addition, financial news sites have been carrying headlines warning of default since practically forever, so I'm seeing little boy who cried wolf syndrome. Indeed, the base rate for Venezuela default is essentially zero, with the last default in 1982, 35 years ago. Therefore the base rate of one in 35 years turns into ~0.6% between now and the forecast horizon. Therefore, I'm holding at zero probability.

Source: Dateline 9-13-2017 In the near term, PDVSA faces a challenging debt repayment schedule since it needs to repay $3.2 billion due mostly in October and November. Based on official reports, the company only has $2 billion in cash to service its debt obligations. Nevertheless, a default is unlikely this year; fighting a political crisis and defaulting at the same time would be too complicated to handle. Venezuela still seems willing and able to pay. In the worst-case scenario, PDVSA might use a grace period of a few weeks, as it did last year, in order to pull coins out of the sofa to pay these bills. The company can still obtain a new loan from Russian oil company Rosneft and propose as collateral its oilfield stakes; it could get funding from Venezuela's public banks (which has already been done recently for about $500 million); or the government can decide to use the central bank\u2019s foreign reserves which are officially estimated at $10 billion, of which $1 billion is in cash and $9 billion in gold bars.  http://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/How-Will-Venezuela-Deal-With-A-PDVSA-Default.html CHAMPS KNOW checklist:\nYes: Comparison classes.

The woes of the group, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., look set to worsen because of US sanctions imposed last month restricting its access to credit. Oil production keeps declining and much of what is exported goes to repay billions of dollars in loans. That puts the government of President Nicolas Maduro in a very tight spot. It relies on PDVSA's export income for 96 percent of foreign earnings, and to pay for many social programs. Reduced oil revenues means\u2019 \"there is a real chance of default,\" said Tamas Varga, an analyst at London-based PVM Oil Associates (para 1-6). The break-even market price for Venezuelan oil \"is well over $125 per barrel,\" Williams said (para 23). That poses a challenge, given global oil prices slumped dramatically three years ago and never recovered. They are now half of what they were in mid-2014. According to PDVSA's latest annual report, the average 2016 price of a barrel of Venezuelan crude was $35.15. The oil company earned $48 billion last year from 2.27 million barrels a day (mbpd) produced -- sharply down from $72 billion in 2015, when it pumped 2.65 mbpd (para. 23-26). Agence France Presse.

It just inked a deal with Venezuela to buy enough oil at a good enough price with the right cash flow to make debt payments through the forecast horizon.   Power player analysis:  China and Russia have been competing for control of what is arguably the world's largest oil reserves, the Orinoco Basin. In recent years they have repeatedly bailed out Venezuela, with last minute rescues designed to extract deals favorable to them with the Venezuelan government. The Rosneft deal means tha Russia has just one-upped China. Power player bonus: for Russia as this deal gives the middle finger to President Trump: this undercuts what little leverage the U.S. might have had on Venezuela. Even worse for the U.S. and jobs in the hard hit Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas area: some refineries have built systems dependent upon imports of Venezuela heavy crude oil, which has characteristics that make this equipment so specialized that it can't take other feed stocks. Sources:  Dateline: Aug. 29, 2017 MOSCOW \u2013 Russia\u2019s Rosneft and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. signed a tentative memorandum of understanding Thursday for the joint development of the Carabobo-2 block in the Andean nation\u2019s Orinoco Belt, the world\u2019s largest oil reserve. The accord was signed after a meeting between Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Venezuelan Vice President Elias Jaua, Russian news agencies reported. The president of the Russian state oil company, Eduard Khudainatov, and Venezuelan Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez, who is also president of state-owned PDVSA, inked the joint-venture deal. According to Rosneft sources, the company will acquire a 40 percent stake in the new joint venture for $1.1 billion, while PDVSA will have the remaining 60 percent interest. The agreement also calls for construction of a 10-million-ton-per-year refinery to improve the quality of the heavy crude destined for export. The Carabobo-2 project, which comprises the Karabobo-2 North and Carabobo-4 West blocks, has a combined acreage of 342 sq km. (132 sq. miles) and is estimated to hold 40 billion barrels of reserves, Rosneft said in a press release. \u201cThis tentative MOU is a major step in globalizing Rosneft\u2019s business,\u201d Khudainatov was quoted as saying in the release. \u201cIf Rosneft joins the project, it will gain access to the rich deposits of the Orinoco Petroleum Belt, a resource base that could become an important driver of additional growth in the company\u2019s output after 2015 and transform Rosneft into a major player in this very promising region of Latin America.\u201d Ramirez said earlier this year that the Orinoco Belt is the world\u2019s largest oil reserve with almost 300 billion barrels of recoverable crude using current technology. Separately, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak and Venezuelan Finance Minister Jorge Giordani signed off on a $1.5 billion credit line from Rosneft to PDVSA pending Venezuelan approval of the proposed joint venture. Annual disbursements will be capped at $300 million annually. The two countries also signed an inter-governmental agreement for the creation of the Moscow Popular Development Bank and a contract for the construction of 30,000 homes in the Latin American country.

Maduro launched the warning in a speech to his top military leadership, including General Vladimir Padrino, his defense minister, and General Remigio Ceballos, commander of operational strategy, two days before the drills begin Saturday. \"We must be clear, especially for the youth in the military, that we must close ranks within the homeland -- that this is no time for any fissures and that those with doubts should leave the armed forces immediately,\" Maduro said (para. 1-3). Maduro urged the military to \"be prepared to fight fiercely... in the face of an eventual\" US invasion (para 8). Maduro told the military leaders that in the face of possible future added US sanctions on Venezuela, \"I decided to do some re-casting... we have to prepare ourselves\" (para 13). He pointed out that Del Pino, who has been at the helm of PDVSA since 2014, was the architect of agreements between OPEC and non-OPEC countries to boost flagging crude prices.

Yet, there may be another factor that could bring down oil prices as soon as next year\u2026 China. China has been building a strategic crude oil reserve for the last decade, but the size of that reserve remains undisclosed, with analysts making estimates based on China-bound cargoes and satellite imaging. Last year, a Silicone Valley tech company, Orbital Insight, suggested that China may have stored as much as 600 million barrels of crude by May. This was the highest reserve estimate at the time. Since then, the reserve has in all likelihood grown, possibly exceeding the U.S. SPR, which stood at 678.9 million barrels as of August 18th this year. This year, Chinese crude imports have run at record-breaking rates, with the average daily on par with what the U.S. imports, at about 8 million barrels, the Financial Times notes in an analysis. A lot of these, however, are going into storage tanks, analysts believe, and they warn that soon the tanks may fill up, wreaking havoc on prices and--more notably--on OPEC. The cartel, Russia and 11 other producers agreed last year to remove 1.8 million bpd from global oil supply in an attempt to raise prices above US$50, with hopes for at least $60. This May, they agreed to extend the cuts to March 2018. Nevertheless, prices have remained largely stable around the $50 mark because of rising U.S. output, which last week jumped above 9.5 million bpd, according to the EIA (para 1-5). Slav, I. (2017).

The figures show that Venezuela, which many economists and analysts believe is on the verge of default, has the resources on hand to cover this year's sovereign bond payments. But making the payments will leave the government of President Nicolas Maduro with minimal hard currency to import basic consumer goods, which may fuel shortages of food and medicine and spur triple-digit inflation. \"The country's financial vulnerability has been exacerbated by the weakness of the central bank's foreign currency assets,\" wrote economist Tamara Herrera of Financial Synthesis in a research report.

President Nicolas Maduro's government has so far gone to extraordinary lengths to service it, prioritizing debt repayments over all else, including badly needed imports of food, medicine and other essentials. But all-important oil production and revenues have been declining, and its currency reserves have shrunk to just $10 billion. Most of that is in gold, locked away in Caracas as security for loans.

After years of mismanagement, the country appears closer and closer to running out of money. Adding to investors\u2019 concern is the increasingly anti-democratic turn of President Nicolas Maduro, whose move to rewrite the constitution and strip power from congress has been met with U.S. sanctions. Still, for all the turmoil, Venezuela has a track record of paying its debts, and investors who\u2019ve held on through the worst of times have been rewarded with some of the world\u2019s best bond returns. 1. What are investors\u2019 main concerns? First, the economics look bad. Foreign reserves have dwindled to a 15-year low of about $10 billion, a grim figure considering Venezuela and the state oil company known as PDVSA are due to pay about $13 billion in debt before the end of 2018. Combine that with oil prices at half of what they were just three years ago, slumping crude output in a country that gets 95 percent of its export revenue from that one resource, triple-digit inflation and a rapidly shrinking economy, and it\u2019s a tough road ahead. Second, the level of political turmoil is unprecedented, with deadly street protests against Maduro\u2019s government raging on a near daily basis, open calls for the military to stage a coup and shortages of food and medicines as the government prioritizes debt payments over imports of basic goods.  2. How creditworthy is the country? Venezuela isn\u2019t current with most of its key economic statistics, so the most basic data an investor would use to gauge the country\u2019s creditworthiness aren\u2019t available. One key number is the current account balance, a broad measure of trade that looks at money moving in and out of the country, including bond interest payments. Normally, a government would borrow money to plug any gap, but steep borrowing costs preclude such a tactic for Venezuela. Estimates of the size of the country\u2019s current account deficit vary depending on which economist you ask and assumptions about how much the country has slashed imports to keep paying its debts. Still, we can be pretty sure that the situation is unsustainable. 3. When will the money run out? To make ends meet, the government is blowing through central bank reserves. That hoard now consists of just $1 billion in cash, with much of the balance made up of gold bars, according to investment bank Torino Capital. Venezuela can buy itself some time by continuing to take advance payments for its oil from China and Russia -- as long as they\u2019re willing to pay them. And it can keep reducing imports. However, the economy depends on foreign manufacturers for everything from antibiotics to baby formula, and shortages have already become severe, so the humanitarian costs are significant (para. 1-4).

The new \u201cconstituent assembly,\u201d put together to rewrite the constitution, is seen by most as an attempt to erode the nation\u2019s democracy and consolidate power in the hands of the president (para. 1-2)\nBut even if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro manages to maintain power and push through a new constitution that defangs any restraints on his grip, he won\u2019t be able to outrun the spiraling economic crisis. Perhaps the most visible economic issue is the debt payments that fall due this year. Venezuela has $5 billion in debt maturing before the year is out \u2013 both in sovereign bonds and in debt payments by state-owned oil company PDVSA (para. 4).\nThat is an alarming figure given that the government has an estimated $3 billion in cash reserves, according to S&P Global Ratings, a paltry sum that means a default in the next few months is more likely than not. Venezuela has to pay $725 million in debt payments this month, although the problem gets really serious in October and November, when a combined $3.6 billion in debt must be paid to bondholders. The value of PDVSA\u2019s bonds has plunged in recent weeks (para. 4-6).

The brimming oil inventories that have pressured prices for three years had started to decline in recent weeks as U.S. demand rose and OPEC production was reduced. But some analysts say this decline in stockpiles could reverse later in the year as U.S. crude production continues to grow. A poll of 15 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal at the end of July, predicted that Brent crude, the international benchmark, will average $53 a barrel this year, down $2 from the June survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $51 a barrel this year, down a dollar from the previous survey. Banks in the survey have also downgraded their expectations for next year, predicting Brent crude will average $55 a barrel, down $2 from the June poll. The banks expect WTI to average $53 a barrel in 2018, also down $2 (para 1-4). However, stock levels around the world continue to be above historical averages, as the world struggles to drain the crude glut that has pressured prices since 2014.

The government and state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, also known as PdVSA, together owe $5 billion in principal and interest payments due between now and the end of the year, according to Caracas Capital Markets.

During their house arrest, they\u2019d been broadcasting messages using Periscope, a live-streaming service that has become extraordinarily popular in Venezuela, encouraging their supporters to oppose President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nPerhaps ironically, hours before his arrest Ledezma had lambasted the opposition coalition, MUD, for its many failures in the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s vote.

It was planning new laws, the release of its political prisoners and overhauls intended to pull Venezuela out of a deep economic crisis. Its eye was on the presidency in 2018. But with one contentious vote on Sunday, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro effectively liquidated any political challenge that the opposition might present for him for years to come. Around midnight, officials certified the creation of a new political body, known as the constituent assembly, with the power to rewrite the Constitution to favor Mr. Maduro and empowered in the meantime to dismiss any branch of government viewed as disloyal. It was a dramatic crash for the country\u2019s opposition in its long quest to regain control of Venezuela after a tide of popular discontent brought Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to the presidency in 1999. Not since the politicians joined the military to back a failed coup in 2002 \u2014 which spurred Mr. Ch\u00e1vez to purge his opponents \u2014 have members of Venezuela\u2019s opposition been laid so low. \u201cThey played all their cards, and they played them effectively,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, a foreign policy expert at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, citing the opposition\u2019s attempts to parry Mr. Maduro this year. \u201cBut now all of their channels for representation and means for mediation have essentially evaporated.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s decision to sweep aside his rivals leaves them at a difficult crossroads, analysts said.

Why? Its members are addicted to oil. Eight months after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a plan for its 14 members and 10 allied countries to withhold almost 2% of the world\u2019s oil every day to boost prices, seven of the 11 OPEC members that pledged to cut appear to be producing more oil than promised. Crude prices have actually fallen, by 7.6% to $52.52 a barrel, since the beginning of the year\u2014half what the cartel called a fair price just three years ago and a level that some say is here for the long term. Previously, low production costs meant OPEC members profited even when oil prices fell. These days, members have ramped up government spending to keep populations happy and cover military expenses, and don\u2019t have a cushion to let oil revenues slip. Their strained budgets can be covered only through increasingly high prices per barrel, and if prices are low they need to produce more (para 1-5). The output has stolen market share from the cartel\u2019s members and pushed prices lower. OPEC\u2019s share of the global oil market has shrunk to 40% today from 55% in the early 1970s, when its embargo on sales to the West quadrupled oil prices in six months (para 13). The dynamic working against OPEC is that, collectively, its members need the highest oil prices of any industry player\u2014more than companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. , Royal Dutch Shell PLC and most U.S. shale producers, according to Goldman Sachs . For decades, OPEC was the low-cost producer of oil. During the boom years of 2011 through 2014, OPEC members, which largely fund national spending with oil revenue, could balance their budgets with oil prices $10 to $40 a barrel less than most oil companies needed to fund their spending and pay dividends. Today, OPEC needs $10 to $20 a barrel more than Big Oil and U.S. exploration and production outfits, the investment bank said in a report to clients (para. 13- 15).

The new constitution will permit the government to bring order to Venezuela, convulsed by unrest and a devastating economic crisis, Mr. Maduro said. \u201cI wanted to be the first to vote for peace, for sovereignty and the independence of Venezuela,\u201d the president said. \u201cToday is a historic day.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s adversaries, who have led four months of protests that have cost at least 113 lives, say that the assembly the president wants would lead to the dissolution of the opposition-controlled congress and an end to the few democratic levers still available to them. Mr. Maduro and other aides have warned that, with the assembly, they\u2019d arrest key opponents and dismiss Attorney General Luisa Ortega, a former government stalwart who recently broke with the government. \u201cThere is a privileged group that wants to do away with the constitution and the country,\u201d said Julio Borges, president of the congress and a sharp critic of the government. \u201cThat violent minority has aggravated the moral and social crisis of the Venezuelan family.

President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had ordered a rewriting of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution. The election on Sunday was simply to pick the members of the constituent assembly that will carry it out; there was no option to reject the process. Nearly all candidates were politicians close to Mr. Maduro, presumably assuring that the outcome would leave his leftist movement with complete control of the country once the assembly takes charge. \u201cI said rain, thunder or lightning, the 30th of July was going to come,\u201d the president said in a shaky video made from his vehicle after he cast his ballot. He remained sanguine throughout the day, saying the vote would soon bring peace to a country where more than 110 people have died in unrest during protests this year against his rule. But the powers of the new assembly members will be so vast that they could possibly remove Mr. Maduro from office, some analysts noted, ending a presidency that has been deeply unpopular, even among many leftists (para. 1-5). At least 10 people were killed in clashes between the police and protesters, the government said, including two boys, ages 13 and 17, who were shot in the western state of T\u00e1chira. A police officer was shot in front of a school in T\u00e1chira, and a 43-year-old man was killed in the central city of Barquisimeto in Lara State when a bullet pierced his head, according to the state prosecutor\u2019s office (para. 13). The focus of many voters in Caracas seemed to be on food, not politics. Venezuela remains in an economic tailspin, causing severe shortages of food and medicine (para 22) \u201cWhen the opposition got the National Assembly, they said there would be food, and now it\u2019s even worse,\u201d said Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, 43, a government employee who said he supported Mr. Maduro. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019m asking of the constitutional assembly is that they start putting out food,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if they don\u2019t, the people are going to get angry\u201d (para. 22-24).

President Nicolas Maduro has scheduled a vote that would allow him to replace the current legislative body, the National Assembly, with an entirely new institution known as the Constituent Assembly. Maduro's opponents control the National Assembly, holding 112 of the body's 167 seats, and have been battling with him for political power since they won a majority of seats in December 2015. Before the winners of those elections took office, Maduro stacked the country's Supreme Court with loyalists to prevent his own impeachment (para 1-3). Experts say the vote's outcome will be a foregone conclusion: Maduro will be able to consolidate political power (para.5). The opposition hasn't submitted any candidates for the vote because it doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the election.

Violence continued to rage on the street, with another seven-people killed during the latest opposition-led strike against President Nicolas Maduro's planned election for a powerful new Constituent Assembly on Sunday. Adding to Venezuela's growing international isolation, Colombian airline Avianca suddenly stopped operations in the country on Thursday due to \"operational and security limitations\". Maduro's critics were planning to pile more pressure on the unpopular leftist leader by holding roadblocks across the nation dubbed \"The Takeover of Venezuela\" on Friday. \"We're going to keep fighting, we're not leaving the streets,\" said opposition lawmaker Jorge Millan. The government banned protests from Friday to Tuesday, raising the likelihood of more violence in volatile Venezuela. Many people have been stocking up food and staying home.

An astonishing 93% of them say they cannot afford the food they need, and three-quarters have lost weight in the past year. The regime that caused this preventable tragedy professes great love for the poor. Yet its officials have embezzled billions, making Venezuela the most corrupt country in Latin America, as well as the most ineptly governed. It is a textbook example of why democracy matters: people with bad governments should be able to throw the bums out. That is perhaps why President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is so eager to smother what little is left of democracy in Venezuela. On July 30th, barring a last-minute change of mind, Mr Maduro will hold a rigged election to rubber-stamp the creation of a hand-picked constituent assembly whose aim is to perpetuate his unpopular state-socialist regime (see article). It will complete the destruction of the powers of parliament, now controlled by the opposition, and wreck the integrity of a presidential election due next year, which, if it were free and fair, Mr Maduro would surely lose. Opponents say the assembly will install Cuban-style communism. At the very least, its creation will provoke more violence in a country where the streets are already choked with tear gas and littered with buckshot from police shotguns. In almost four months of protests, more than 100 people have died; hundreds more have been locked up for political reasons. All this infuriates Venezuelans. It should alarm the outside world, too. The clueless caudillo of Caracas\nBy the end of this year Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse since 2012 will be the steepest in modern Latin American history. Income per person is now back where it was in the 1950s. The main cause of this calamity is ideological. Following the lead of his late mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Mr Maduro spends public money lavishly, especially on his supporters. Weak oil prices and inept management mean he cannot pay his bills. So he prints money and blames speculators for the resulting inflation, which is expected to exceed 1,000% this year. The black-market price for US dollars is now about 900 times the official rate. Price controls and the expropriation of private firms have led to shortages of food and medicine. With hospitals bare of supplies, the maternal mortality rate jumped by 66% last year. Officials flagrantly profiteer from their access to hard currency and basic goods. Venezuela has become a favored route for drug-trafficking and is awash with arms. Some left-wingers, such as Britain\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, imagine that Venezuela\u2019s \u201cBolivarian revolution\u201d is a promising experiment in social justice. Tell that to the tens of thousands of Venezuelans who have fled to neighboring countries. As the crisis worsens, their number will rise.

Last year, the U.S. became the world's top net exporter of fuel, an outgrowth of booming domestic production since the shale oil revolution started in 2010. That's a fundamental shift from the traditional U.S. role in global markets as a top importer and consumer. Net exports are on track to hit another record in 2017, making foreign fuel markets increasingly important for the future growth prospects and profit margins of U.S. refiners. Shale oil producers have provided refiners with abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies, giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel. The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum products to foreign markets. That compares to net fuel imports of 2.3 million just a decade ago, according to U.S. government data (para 1-5). Latin American Buyers U.S. refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where refineries have been running below capacity. U.S. exports have also made inroads into Brazil's market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel (para. 16). In recession-scarred Venezuela, the country's largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity, a level that has required state-run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand (para. 19). Between them, Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year - mostly from the United States - an amount suggesting that U.S. exports will grow again this year over last year's record levels (para. 19-20).

U.S. President Donald Trump spared Venezuela for now from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry, but such actions were still under consideration.

But policy makers continue to weigh the potential risks of such sanctions, which include inflicting further suffering on Venezuelans and raising U.S. domestic gasoline prices.

In short, the escalating violence and civil strife in the country means an impending \"inflection point,\" Dallen says: \" ...the Maduro regime has been unable to raise significant foreign capital \u2013 aside from the loan from Rosneft (ROSN.Russia) against 49.9% of Petroleos de Venezuela's U.S. refining operation Citgo (a story which we first help break on December 21) and the \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d cash injection from Goldman Sachs last month. The Maduro regime\u2019s refusal to co-exist and/or negotiate with an Opposition-dominated legislature (a task of functioning democracies all over the world) has led Maduro to unleash his own weapon of mass destruction \u2013 the hydrogen bomb of calling a National Constituent Assembly (ANC) ...\nThe government is using this wafer-thin veneer of constitutional legality for two reasons ... One is to bring along the military rank-and-file. While the upper echelons of the military are \u201call in\u201d as they are making money with various schemes ... The second reason for the legal lipservice is an attempt to give legal surety to potential investors (namely Russia, China & others interested in investing in oil, gold and mineral mining ventures) that were put off by the lack of National Assembly approval or a legally solid workaround. ... the Supreme Court takes over the right to approve any new oil, gold or mineral investments since the National Assembly is in \u201ccontempt.\u201d But Russia and other investors felt that ground was too shaky to invest billions of dollars, hence the regime\u2019s National Constituent Assembly is designed to replace the obstinate National Assembly and pave that legal path for investment more solidly ...\"\nOne more sign that Venezuela's cash situation is in peril: In mid-June, Canadian miner Gold Reserve (GDRZF) said it received a $40 million installment from Venezuela as part of a $1 billion settlement to be paid over the next two years. The settlement resolves the Venezuelan government's expropriation of a Gold Reserve copper-and-gold project with the possibility of a new mining joint venture. In 1992, Gold Reserves acquired the Brisas gold and copper mining project in southeastern Venezuela, believed to be one of the largest undeveloped such deposits in the world. Gold Reserves invested US$300 million in Brisas through April 2008, when the Venezuelan government under then-President Hugo Chavez revoked its project authorization. The International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Gold Reserve damages and interest. Much more detail on the case is on the Gold Reserve website (para. 1-6). DeFotis, D.

Corporate hopes were raised by a deal between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other non-OPEC producers to cut production, which lifted oil prices above $58 a barrel in January, after they had slid to as low as $27 in 2016. But Brent crude prices have since slipped back below $50 and banks have lowered price forecasts, amid surging output from the United States and other nations not bound by the global oil pact. Investors are again focusing on the ability of top oil firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) to live within their means and eke out profits when oil has failed to recover, as hoped, to $60. The majors, often dubbed Big Oil, have already been through tough spending cuts since a collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 from above $100.

Its tragic and volatile mix of a failing, oil-dependent economy, political gridlock and simmering unrest is well known at this point.\nBut things are building to a head, partly due to the relentless logic of the bond market and partly due to the more proprietary logic of U.S. foreign policy.\nVenezuelan bonds, which haven't looked rock-solid for a few years, crashed this week as embattled President Nicola Maduro renewed calls to rewrite the country's constitution, which would effectively disenfranchise the millions of Venezuelans who oppose him and entrench his regime. The U.S. has warned it may impose much tougher sanctions if Maduro goes ahead with his plan.\nCrisis Prices\nVenezuelan bonds have crashed to distressed levels, with five-year debt yielding 36 percent Whether Maduro will, and what those sanctions might be, are the big unknowns here. But there's an awful confluence of factors that could quite easily push this toward a debacle by the end of the year. \nVenezuela\u2019s economy is in free-fall: By the end of this year, it will have shrunk by 32 percent compared to where it was at the end of 2013, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.

Avenues and thoroughfares across eastern Caracas were shut down after hastily issued calls by student groups, while a public-transportation strike kept buses from, rolling on the south side for a third day. Morning commuters walked to work in many areas, fording piles of trash and debris, or ducking under ropes and wires used to cordon off streets. The abrupt traffic paralysis came in the face of an assembly Maduro has set for July 30 that would begin reconceiving the crisis-torn nation\u2019s charter, an initiative critic say is meant to give him authoritarian power. A coalition of opposition parties have organized more than 100 days of demonstrations that have claimed scores of lives and left hundreds more injured.

His decision caused uproar. Anti-government activists, who had already been on the streets for a month protesting about the erosion of democracy and the dire state of the economy, stepped up their campaign and have been demonstrating ever since. More than 90 people have died in the violence and thousands have been injured and arrested. On July 16, some 7.2m Venezuelans rejected the assembly in an opposition-organised referendum. The attorney-general and a handful of other establishment figures have tried to dissuade Mr Maduro from pressing ahead (para. 1-3). What is a \u2018constituent assembly\u2019?  In its narrowest sense, it is a body of people tasked with either writing or modifying a constitution. Perhaps the most famous example is the group of men who drew up the US constitution in 1787. Usually, once such an assembly has finished its job, it is dissolved. That is what happened in post-partition India, for example, and in Italy after the second world war (para. 5). Who can vote on July 30 and who are the candidates? Everyone on Venezuela\u2019s electoral register \u2014 about 20m people \u2014 can cast a ballot. Voters will elect 364 members to the assembly in a municipal vote. Each of the country\u2019s 335 municipalities will get one representative with the exception of the 23 state capitals, which get two each, and Caracas, which will have seven (para. 11). The opposition and analysts say the municipal vote is skewed in the government\u2019s favour because it gives sparsely-populated rural municipalities, where Mr Maduro has most support, the same weight as urban municipalities where the opposition is stronger. In addition to these 364 representatives, 181 candidates will be elected by different sectors of society, bringing the total to 545. Students, for example, will choose 24 members via sectoral elections in which only students can take part. Workers get 79, pensioners 28, indigenous people eight, and so on. Business people get five. Again, the opposition says this system is arbitrary and will favour the government (para 11-13). Long, G. (2017). What would a new constitution mean for Venezuela? The Financial Times. World.

The symbolic poll, which will also ask voters if they want early elections, is intended to further dent Maduro's legitimacy amid a crippling economic crisis and three months of anti-government protests that have led to nearly 100 deaths. The opposition has cast the vote, which begins at 7 a.m. local time at some 2,000 centers around the country, as an act of civil disobedience to be followed by \"zero hour,\" a possible reference to a national strike or other escalated actions against Maduro. But the vote does not appear to augur a short-term change of government or a solution to the country's political stalemate. Maduro, 54, says Sunday's plebiscite is illegal and meaningless. Instead, the leftist leader is campaigning for an official July 30 vote for the new assembly, which will be able to rewrite the constitution and dissolve state institutions. \"(Even with) rain, thunder or lightning, Sunday's poll will go ahead!\" said opposition leader Henrique Capriles in a Friday evening broadcast. \"We Venezuelans are going out to vote for the future, the fatherland and the freedom of Venezuela.\" Voters will be asked three questions: if they reject the constitutional assembly, if they want the armed forces to defend the existing constitution and if they want elections before Maduro's term in office ends in 2018 (para. 1-7).

The statement, which was distributed to its joint venture partners and which Reuters saw, comes after a prominent government-allied lawyer said a new legislative body could rewrite parts of the constitution to ensure the state has full ownership of the oil industry. The new \"constituent assembly\" would supersede other institutions and has sparked fears that President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular administration could take aim at joint venture partners, which include large oil companies Chevron Corp and Rosneft. But PDVSA, whose full name is Petroleos de Venezuela, was quelling fears that a more radical wing of the ruling Socialist Party could be out to nationalize companies, as late leader Hugo Chavez did a decade ago. PDVSA \"guarantees legal security to investors, partners, and others,\" the statement read. \"In the case of joint ventures, PDVSA has honored and will continue to honor the legal norms that allow the possibility of doing business with private companies.\" Venezuelan oil laws enacted under Chavez allow for minority participation of private companies in oilfield joint ventures, and numerous companies formed such partnerships despite nationalizations in the sector.

S&P reduced the nation\u2019s long-term foreign and local currency ratings to CCC-, or three notches below investment grade, from CCC on Tuesday.

The world\u2019s largest drillers failed to take advantage of high prices during the boom years before 2014 to repay debt, according to the report published on Tuesday. Instead they embarked on costly investments in new projects and dividends, leaving them unprepared for the painful downturn that ensued. Now, a weak recovery in oil prices is making it harder to reduce the debt accumulated in recent years. Exxon last year lost the platinum credit rating it held since the Great Depression, and all of its largest rivals, including Total SA, BP Plc, and Royal Dutch Shell Plc also faced similar reductions. Further downgrades could become more likely later this year or in 2018 if oil prices remain below $50 a barrel, the report said (para. 1-3). Get-Out-of-Jail \"The modest improvement in oil prices this year reflects the support from the OPEC and Russian agreement to constrain production,\" Simon Redmond, director of corporate ratings for commodities at S&P, wrote in the report. \"But it hardly offers a get-out-of-jail-free card for ratings\" (para. 6). S&P warned Exxon seven weeks ago that the explorer\u2019s balance sheet was under strain, degrading the oil producer\u2019s outlook to negative. The rating company said it worried Exxon may \u201cprioritize capital spending, acquisitions or shareholder returns over debt reduction.\u201d Total, Exxon, and Chevron face the greatest danger of a ratings cut, given their elevated debt loads and lackluster efforts to curtail investments and dividend payouts. An exception to the trend is Shell, the only company among the five to receive a positive outlook from S&P. Shell outperformed its peers last year, putting it in a better position than its rivals to cut costs as prices remain low. An agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production is proving unable so far to significantly raise prices and diminish a global supply glut. Oil companies may choose to prioritize debt reduction by selling off assets and winding down long-term investments, Harvey said. Alternatively, they could seek more acquisitions to lock in profitability at lower prices, such as BP investing in fields in continental Africa (para. 6-9). Tognini, G. (2017).

State oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) has proposed selling a 9 percent stake in the San Cristobal field to ONGC Videsh (OVL), a subsidiary of India's state-owned top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.NS), the sources said this week. ONGC Videsh already holds a 40 percent stake in the field, which produces around 22,000-23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil. While the amount of the sale would be relatively modest, according to analysts, any extra income would be welcome for PDVSA. Venezuela, struggling under triple-digit inflation and Soviet-style product shortages as its socialist economy unravels, has been hit hard by the falling price of oil, its economic lifeline. The OPEC nation's oil output has slipped and PDVSA PDVSA.UL is struggling to maintain investment in its oilfields, which hold the world's largest crude reserves. The state company already offered Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) a stake in a joint venture in an extra-heavy crude project in the Orinoco Belt, sources told Reuters in March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak about the negotiations, said PDVSA was still negotiating with ONGC and no deal was certain. Under Venezuela's hydrocarbon law, the state must maintain more than 50 percent of all oil ventures, hence PDVSA can only offer up to 9 percent to the Indian firm (para. 1-8). Verma, N. & Ulmer, A.

No salary increase can stop the economic catastrophe that the country is going through: a rate of inflation that exceeds 700 percent due to a huge fiscal deficit financed with freshly printed money; scarcity of food and medicines due both to a lack of foreign currency to import and a destroyed productive sector after decades of brutal regulation; and an external debt that would require over five years of exports to be paid in its totality, which is bringing the country to brink of default (para. 1-2). Therefore, there are two possible scenarios that could unfold: The first is that Maduro goes on with his plan to rewrite and introduce a new constitution, ignoring the will of the vast majority of Venezuelans. In this scenario, he would manage to survive this crisis and stay in power for the foreseeable future as a ruthless dictator with a new constitution that fits this purpose (para. 6). Venezuela\u2019s economic standing would only get worse in this situation. While the government keeps waiting for some miraculous sharp increase in the price of oil, it will keep finding ways to finance its survival (and to line the pockets of government officials). This means it would keep emptying its foreign reserves and mortgaging the state\u2019s domestic and foreign assets in exchange for more financing, here and there, until no longer possible. The government's absurd socialist policies will keep foreign investment away, thus further hindering the recoveries of the private sector and the oil industry. But under this scenario, something has to give: With fewer and fewer sources of income, the government will eventually have no other choice but to default on its sovereign foreign debt, raising the humanitarian crisis to a whole new level. The second scenario, the one the vast majority of Venezuelans would like to see play out, involves the restoration of democracy and an eventual transition of power to a democratically elected government. Under this scenario, the economic situation won\u2019t be solved immediately, but Venezuelans will see a light at the end of the tunnel (para. 6-9). Bahar, D.

The latest arm-twisting by the government promises to heat up a more than three-month-old confrontation between the Maduro regime and thousands in the opposition, and which has already claimed 90 lives. Maduro\u2019s ballot-box demands came just a day after government forces allowed pro-regime thugs to storm into the National Assembly, the last bastion for the anti-Maduro opposition, and beat up opposition lawmakers. In his attempt to remain in office, Maduro is looking to his base of state employees, and lower income Venezuelans, for support.

Crude ended the quarter 9% lower, and sank as much as 21.9% in June from highs in February. A loss of 20% or more typically signals the start of a bear market. It is a sharp shift from the first months of 2017, when investors had been divided over whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would stick to pledges to cut output, but generally believed those cuts would help ease the global supply glut and lift prices. For a time, it seemed almost nothing could shake oil investors out of their malaise. Prices fell even after OPEC announced it would extend its cuts into next year and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. stockpiles fell nearly every week during the quarter. At the same time, U.S. output has risen more quickly than many predicted: The EIA is now forecasting that it will average a record of 10 million barrels a day next year. Output from Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the production-cut agreements, has ramped up as well (para. 1-6). Saudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has a lot riding on higher oil prices. The country is targeting oil prices of $60 a barrel to smooth the way for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, its national oil company. That is one reason some investors still hope that OPEC will make deeper cuts (para. 13). Citigroup is among the firms that believe the market is actually getting tighter, but the firm\u2019s analysts say for now, negative sentiment could be hard to shake. Citi analysts say the chances that Brent crude futures will climb to $60 by the end of the year are less than 50%, down from their previous estimate of a 65% chance. Brent settled at $47.92 Friday. \u201cThe fund community has been burned so badly as to reduce the likelihood of them jumping back in no matter what the fundamentals,\u201d the analysts wrote in a June 26 research note.

The narrative would be fitting for Mr. P\u00e9rez, a part-time action actor. But Caracas residents have been glued to social media since Tuesday, looking for any clues that would explain the bizarre events of that night. Mr. P\u00e9rez had suddenly become the country\u2019s most-wanted man. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ordered the National Guard to deploy around the Supreme Court building and other sensitive sites. In a late-night televised address to the nation, he called the flight a \u201cterror attack\u201d aimed at destabilizing the government. \u201cThe person who took that aircraft launched a coup and took up arms against the republic,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. No one was killed or injured in the incident that capped a dramatic day in Venezuela, in which Mr. Maduro threatened civil war, congress was overrun by national guards, and Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who has become a fierce critic of Mr. Maduro, was shorn of more of her powers. On Wednesday, she was barred from leaving the country and had her bank account frozen. The president\u2019s fiery speech and rapid military response only fueled suspicions among his opponents and ordinary Venezuelans that Mr. P\u00e9rez\u2019s flight was no act of resistance, but rather a stunt staged by the unpopular government to justify further consolidating its authority (para. 1-5).

On her last trip, they made a good haul, securing seven tons of flour, sugar and cooking oil from the former British colony in exchange for fresh shrimp from home. But on the way back their rickety 46-foot boat capsized, leaving Ms. Revilla and her companions clinging to the wreckage for nearly two days before she and two others ran out of strength and drowned, according to survivors. Her stepfather says her 3-year-old daughter, Isabel, keeps asking, \u201cWhere is my mama?\u201d As Venezuela\u2019s economy crumbles, an increasingly desperate people are doing all they can to get food and medicine. Here that can involve great peril. Venezuelans make trips as long as 10 hours to hawk shellfish, plastic chairs, house doors, ceramic pots and even exotic animals like iguanas and brightly feathered macaws. They are exchanged for basic goods\u2014rice, detergent, diapers\u2014that Caracas is increasingly unable to provide. \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to Trinidad that we have any food here,\u201d said 49-year-old Angela Caballero, a resident of this town on a peninsula that extends toward the island. \u201cIf that didn\u2019t come, we\u2019d be dead.\u201d A decade ago, Venezuela\u2019s late strongman, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, promoted bartering to boost food production and create \u201ca socialist market, a market of equals.\u201d But today, many of his compatriots in far-flung towns like Irapa have a different take on that direct approach to the marketplace. \u201cThis is savage capitalism,\u201d town councilman Guillermo Mendoza said. \u201cThe role of the government in this is to just keep quiet.\u201d Venezuelan and Trinidadian officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the cross-border barter trade. Such evidence of economic desperation is an embarrassment for Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who denies the country is in a crisis. Trinidad, meanwhile, recently signed a deal with its larger neighbor to develop a major offshore gas field. Venezuelan fishermen have been making weekly trips to Trinidad since food scarcities intensified two years ago, said Eutaquio Fern\u00e1ndez, captain of that ill-fated boat. As the cash-strapped government slashes imports, Irapa residents say food rations meant to last a week reach them barely once every two months. CLAP, a year-old state distribution program, has been mired in delays and allegations of corruption, including from a congressional investigation that found evidence of $200 million in overpricing by government-contracted suppliers (para. 1-10).

A country that was once one of Latin America\u2019s wealthiest is seeing its democratic institutions collapse, leading to levels of disease, hunger and dysfunction more often seen in war-torn nations than oil-rich ones. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has called for a National Constitutional Assembly to be elected on July 30 to draft a new constitution, in which ill-defined communal councils will take the place of Venezuela\u2019s traditional governing institutions, such as state governments and the opposition-dominated Congress. The new assembly appears to be rigged to heavily represent groups that back the government. The Maduro government says that the new assembly will find a peaceful way forward for a country enduring an economic depression and standing on the brink of civil conflict. The government says it is building on the legacy of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, a military man who vowed to fight corruption, dismantle the venal old political establishment and be a voice for millions of poor Venezuelans. But the opposition, which is boycotting the assembly vote, calls it a naked attempt to end democracy and turn the country into a Cuba-style communist autocracy. The government\u2019s own attorney general calls the vote illegal. The 545-member assembly, a modern-day soviet, would hold unlimited power while it writes a new governing charter, which could take years. Meantime, the assembly is widely expected to scrap next year\u2019s presidential elections. \u201cThis is the last battle for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d says David Smilde, a Venezuela expert at Tulane University. For the U.S., the prospect of a new Cuba sitting atop trillions of dollars of oil reserves is profoundly unpleasant. For the past decade, Venezuela has aligned itself with Russia, China, Iran and Syria. Whether it thrives or implodes, Mr. Maduro\u2019s petrostate could cause far greater headaches to the U.S. and Latin America than isolated Cuba. An implosion could mean bigger shipments of cocaine to Central America and the U.S., as well as a massive increase in the current flow of tens of thousands of refugees already fleeing the country for the U.S., Colombia, Brazil and elsewhere. And a consolidation of power could let Mr. Maduro deepen his partnership with U.S. adversaries. The Trump administration has criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s plans to change the constitution, urging \u201crespect for democratic norms and processes.\u201d The U.S. has called for Venezuela to free political prisoners, respect the opposition-controlled congress and \u201chold free and democratic elections.\u201d Mr. Maduro\u2019s move has aggravated Venezuela\u2019s political crisis. The opposition, sensing a do-or-die moment, plans to ramp up daily street protests. Some 80 people have died in such demonstrations in the past three months, and the president is unlikely to ease off on the tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons (para. 1-8).

Argentina is pre-occupied with its economic reform project; Brazil with the political instability generated by its massive corruption probe; Colombia with its peace process; Chile with imminent presidential elections; and so forth. Occasionally, though, there are moments of attempted multilateral diplomacy \u2013 such as last week\u2019s meeting of the OAS. Sadly, the session fell short of its original billing: to provide a regional response to Venezuela\u2019s escalating social, economic and political crises. A resolution condemning President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s increasing authoritarianism failed to win the 23 votes needed after most of the left-wing bloc of ALBA nations, which includes Nicaragua and Bolivia, voted against the motion, and a group of eight mostly Caribbean countries abstained. The frustration among the 20 countries that did vote for the motion \u2013 including the US, Brazil and Mexico \u2013 was palpable. \u201cWhile we are unable to agree here, in the streets of Caracas \u2026violence is continuing,\u201d rued Luis Videgaray the Mexican foreign minister. Venezuela is, indeed, a moral stain on the region. But that does not mean the OAS session was entirely in vain. The country\u2019s problems were aired publicly. The aggressive insults of Venezuela foreign minister Delcy Rodr\u00edguez confirmed the regime\u2019s recalcitrance. The objections of the abstainers (many of which enjoyed Venezuelan oil largesse in the past) were largely on procedural grounds, and they avoided going on the record either to support Maduro or to assert the principle of non-intervention. That proved wise, as the next day Venezuela presented 10 proposals on other countries\u2019 human rights records \u2013 an obvious contradiction of Caracas\u2019s own position about not prying into other countries\u2019 affairs. The last time the OAS met to discuss Venezuela, in March, a similar resolution failed. The Maduro government crowed over that \u201ctriumph\u201d too. But two days later, when the Venezuelan Supreme Court tried to take over the opposition-controlled National Assembly in a thinly-disguised coup, the international reaction was swift and furious. The government soon reversed course. July 30 is the next crunch date in the Venezuelan calendar. That is when the government will supposedly begin to re-write the constitution, and so entrench power further. Such digging in, though, is not the solution to the country\u2019s governability crisis, as the government seems to imagine. The domestic opposition is still mobilized, after over 70 days of protests. Chavismo is fracturing, as more senior officials dissent. The OAS is in permanent session over Venezuela. The US is considering further sanctions against targeted officials. And the international community is better primed to respond to Venezuela\u2019s deepening dictatorship than it was three months ago.

This past week its supporters tried to march again to the headquarters of Venezuela\u2019s election authorities, carrying signs that read \u201cThe Constitutional Assembly is a Fraud.\u201d\nBut their abstention risks giving Maduro a free hand to make sweeping legal and political changes beneath a scrim of democratic legitimacy. If the end result is an extension of Maduro\u2019s rule, analysts say, the assembly could take the country into full-blown dictatorial rule. Maduro appears to be thinking of a deadline of his own \u2014 next year\u2019s presidential election. With the economy collapsing and his approval ratings hovering around 20 percent, he has few prospects for staying in power. But changing Venezuela\u2019s constitution to postpone or cancel the election is one of them. The July 30 vote has added new urgency to an already volatile standoff between Maduro and the swelling crowds of Venezuelans furious at his government. To his opponents, the event will be a firing squad taking aim at the remnants of Venezuelan democracy (para. 1-6). Zu\u00f1iga, M. & Miroff, N. (2017).

It shows little understanding of where it is, how it got there or where it's going. While it still manages to collect new members here and there, its core group looks more fragile than at any point in nearly 30 years. The historic output agreements, put together so painstakingly last year, are failing. Nearly 12 months of shuttle diplomacy culminated in two deals that would see 22 countries cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels a day. Implementation has been better than for any previous output cut, with compliance put at 106 percent in May. A resounding success? Hardly. We're now in the final month of those deals and oil prices are lower than when they were agreed. Not only have producers sacrificed volume, but they earn less for each barrel they do produce. Nothing Gained \nCrude has fallen back below levels last seen before OPEC's November output deal The recent extension of the deals just leaves output restraint in place for another nine months, the best response OPEC could muster. Deeper cuts were barely mentioned. Assertions to do \"whatever it takes\" ring hollow. Indeed, there's no appetite for the big cuts that would demand real sacrifices in countries such as Russia, where normal seasonal factors helped it lower production in the first half of the year. Just sticking to current output levels could be difficult for the rest of 2017: early maintenance work has helped several OPEC members meet their targets but that can't continue. Then there's the problem of recovering output from Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the cuts. The malaise runs much deeper, though. Beneath a veneer of unity, rifts are developing among core Middle East members. The Saudi-led confrontation with Qatar could create the most serious split since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. As I wrote last week, Iraq might be in Mohammed bin Salman's sights next, as Iran's influence there grows and Baghdad lags the rest in implementing output cuts. As if the internal failings weren't enough, OPEC seems to have lost touch with reality. Ministers say higher prices are needed to pay for investment in future production capacity, issuing dire warnings of a future supply crunch. They said the same thing to justify prices soaring above $100 a barrel in 2008. It wasn't true then, and it may not be true now. The oil industry has responded to the price slump by slashing costs. Projects that needed $100 crude to break even have magically been redesigned to be profitable at half that level. OPEC has completely misjudged the North American shale industry and seems not to understand how it is still evolving rapidly. It's a little like trying to explain the internet to my 85-year-old mother, or my 12-year-old daughter trying to explain social media to me. As consultant Morten Frisch tells me, drilling horizontal sidetracks from abandoned wells in the Permian Basin is yielding a 91 percent internal rate of return on a $7 million investment and delivering 1,500 barrels a day of crude. He predicts large production increases from vertical wells in previously produced areas in the Permian (para. 1-9). Lee, J. (2017). OPEC Looks Totally Bewildered by the Oil Market. Bloomberg.

I suspect short covering,\" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. \"And a slight support from a weak U.S. dollar.\" The U.S. dollar index stayed low on Monday against a basket of currencies amid fading expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year. A weaker dollar also makes oil cheaper for countries using other currencies. \"Commodities stabilized after a turbulent week where most sectors suffered large falls,\" ANZ bank said in a note. \"A slightly weaker U.S. dollar also helped improve investor appetite.\" Although oil prices have bounced back from 10-month lows, they are still down about 13 percent since late May, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers agreed to extend a deal to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next March. But crude supplies in the United States, which is not part of the OPEC-led deal, have been dampening the impact of curbs.

Under the agreement, Venezuela borrowed the amount from China and \u201cagreed to pay back in crude and fuel deliveries to state-run Chinese firms\u201d. Lo and behold, in 2014, the decade-long oil boom ended. According to the Foreign Policy magazine, \u201cWith most lending agreed to when oil hovered at more than $100 a barrel, as it did for most of 2007-2014, it seemed a good deal for both sides. However, when oil dropped to close to $30 a barrel in January 2016, this caused Venezuela\u2019s price tag for serving its debt to explode. To repay Beijing today, Venezuela must now ship two barrels of oil for every one it originally agreed to\u201d. According to Reuters: \u201cAt the end of January 2017, [the] PDVSA was late on nearly 10 million barrels of refined products\u2026with shipments delayed by as much as 10 months. It also failed to make timely deliveries of another 3.2 million barrels of crude shipments to CNPC\u201d.  The report added: \u201cBecause oil accounts for almost all of Venezuela\u2019s export revenue, PDVSA\u2019s crisis extends to a citizenry suffering through triple-digit inflation and food shortages reminiscent of the waning days of the Soviet Union\u201d. According to CNBC, the satellite business news television: \u201cPDVSA clearly does not have enough oil or money to satisfy its many creditors. At this point, everybody is trying to collect pending debts from PDVSA by receiving cargoes. But production is not enough\u201d. Foreign Policy further opines: \u201cLarge-scale lending projects without a focus on their economic viability and the repayment capacity of the borrowers are hardly the soundest basis for financial diplomacy of the sort China is attempting to practice. At best, it will lead to mutual suspicions and tensions between lender and borrower. At worst, it will prove financially ruinous for countries burdened with debts they cannot repay in foreign currency they do not possess. With oil prices down, the country is unable even to repair rigs or pay workers to generate income, and the government now faces the prospect of a mass uprising. But Venezuela\u2019s ruinous state has more to do with China than one might think\u201d (para. 1-5). Saleem, F. (2017). Capital suggestion: Venezuela\u2019s debt. The News. International.

If you\u2019ve ever had a friend or family member gripped by gambling addiction or a drug problem, you\u2019ve seen it. You know where this typically ends.\nAt the pawnshop. Last week, Goldman Sachs acquired $2.8 billion worth of bonds issued by Venezuela's state oil company at just 31 cents on the dollar, paying $865 million for the securities. Now Venezuela is looking even more desperate, offering $5 billion worth of bonds at 20 cents on the dollar through a Chinese brokerage, according to the Wall Street Journal, whose reporters have been tracking the country\u2019s attempts to secure emergency cash. That is the kind of financing typically available to people with trembling hands trying to negotiate through bulletproof glass. The latest sale would raise $1 billion in cash but leave Venezuela on the hook for more than $11 billion in payments through 2036, according to this calculation by the Caracas Chronicles blog. The hugely discounted bonds are so obscure that apparently, they\u2019re being sold through some sort of unusual, off-market arrangement, further underscoring their risk (para. 1-4). It\u2019s a whole stewing miasma of mismanagement. Currency controls that produced the world\u2019s highest inflation rate. Capricious, ill-advised nationalization schemes. Oceanic corruption. An endless spending binge on Russian weapons, gasoline subsidies and grandiose infrastructure projects that went bust. Those are just a few reasons (para. 6). But Venezuela has been falling behind on payments to China and Russia, too. Oil-backed loans from the two allies have provided Venezuela with more than $55 billion in the past decade, but the Maduro government's once-vaunted oil industry is falling apart (para. 9). Venezuela hasn\u2019t yet sold its kidney: approximately $10 billion in reserves that is nearly all that\u2019s left over from the decade-long oil boom enjoyed by the late leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He preferred keeping the country\u2019s savings mostly in gold bullion rather than greenbacks so that liquidating it would not be easy (para. 17). It may be only a matter of time before Venezuela empties the vault.

Earlier this year, analysts and traders had projected cutbacks from global exporters would clean up a supply glut and raise prices. Their confidence held up for the first months of 2017, when oil was comfortably ensconced in a range between $50 a barrel and $55. But crude prices have fallen 15% since the start of the year, as U.S. producers rushed to fill the gap left by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Major selloffs have become almost routine\u2014with four one-day drops of more than 4.5% since March. Crude prices rose 19 cents on Friday but dropped 3.8% this past week. Coming into the year, \u201cwe had a strong view that prices were going to rally,\u201d said Ebele Kemery, head of energy investing at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. But around March, she said, her view started to shift. U.S. producers were ramping up more quickly than anyone expected. Expectations for strong demand growth were dimming. The bloated storage levels that OPEC aimed to drain remained full.\nNow, Ms. Kemery expects prices to be even lower in 2018 than today, unless OPEC takes more drastic action. \u201cThe OPEC cut\u2014it\u2019s almost like we need it just to stand still,\u201d Ms. Kemery said. And standing still may be difficult. OPEC and other major producers, including Russia, announced last month that they would continue their output cut of 1.8 million barrels a day through the first quarter of next year. Prices dropped sharply that day and have only continued to slide, reflecting disappointment among investors who had hoped that the group would agree to even deeper cuts or would articulate a strategy on ending cuts next year that would avoid flooding the market again (para. 1-6).

When crude-oil prices were more than $100 a barrel just two years ago, the ensuing profits were huge, filling government coffers and swelling company earnings. Now prices barely cover the average cost to get the oil out of the ground in places like the U.K. Additional expenses, like taxes on profits, mean that the actual break-even price for many projects is higher, and newer and more complex projects generally fall well above the average cash cost of production. Oil-producing nations from Saudi Arabia to Norway are reining in spending while big energy firms like Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp. have made deep spending cuts and laid off thousands of workers. Here's a look at the average cost of producing one barrel of oil\u201442 gallons\u2014in a dozen nations (para. 1). Venezuela Gross taxes: 37.9% of barrel cost Despite holding the world's largest oil reserves with 298 billion barrels, Venezuela's output has been declining in the past two years because of lower investment in its costly heavy crude reservoirs. The Latin American nation produced 2.37 million barrels a day in February, a drop of 90,000 barrels a day compared to its 2014 average, according to the International Energy Agency. Taxes in Venezuela remain among the highest in the world at 50% of profits for foreign companies, though they have fallen from 95% when oil prices were above $100 a barrel (para. 11).

Fitch noted the company's liquidity problem and said they believed it was mainly due to transfers to the central government and lower oil prices. PDVSA's problems are legion, but its use as a government ATM machine doesn't help matters. PDVSA's cash flow generation is always a symptom of its relationship with the central government. So far, the government is still showing a commitment to pay the company's lenders. PDVSA's international long-term ratings of CC are one notch below Fitch's sovereign ratings for Venezuela of CCC. Fitch said in a press release this morning that it continues to expect PDVSA will receive financial aid from the Venezuelan government to make upcoming principal and interest payments. In October, PDVSA said it could be difficult to make scheduled payments on its existing debt, which heightened uncertainty as to PDVSA's liquidity and caused bond prices to fall last week when it missed a payment date (para. 1-3). It is not easy to get updated information from the central bank, or from PDVSA, which is not publicly traded. The Venezuelan government is far from transparent about its use of PDVSA money, which poses challenges to accurately assessing its financial strength (para. 5). Fitch said that the CC rating suggests that default is still a possibility. If a default or debt restructuring occurs, Fitch anticipates average recovery for PDVSA's bondholders of 31%-50%, and likely closer to the lower end of the range in that case. Moreover, if oil prices do not recover following last week's production deal with OPEC and Russia, this could pause further risks to default in order for PDVSA to reduce payments and hand that money over to the government instead of to bond lords. This may also prove popular, at least rhetorically, for the government of left winger Nicolas Maduro. Fitch assumes West Texas Intermediate crude prices to average approximately $42 per barrel in the weeks ahead and to slowly recover to approximately $65 per barrel in the long term (para. 5-7).

On Monday, they upped the ante, threatening that a successor government could forgo paying the debt. \u201cIt is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,\u201d Julio Borges, head of Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled congress, said in a public letter to the New York bank\u2019s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein. \u201cI also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds.\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019s asset-management division last week paid about $865 million for $2.8 billion worth of bonds\u2014or 31 cents on the dollar\u2014that were issued by state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA in 2014 and mature in 2022, according to people familiar with the transaction (para. 1-5). In a statement, Goldman said it bought the securities, which are held in funds and accounts it manages on behalf of clients, from a broker and did not interact with the Venezuelan government. \u201cWe recognize that the situation is complex and evolving and that Venezuela is in crisis,\u201d the bank said. \u201cWe agree that life there has to get better, and we made the investment in part because we believe it will\u201d (para. 7). Goldman Sachs Asset Management manages $750 billion of fixed-income investments for mutual funds, pension funds and other investors, about $40 billion of which is dedicated to emerging markets. It bought the bonds from London-based brokerage Dinosaur Group, people familiar with the sale said. Dinosaur Chief Executive Glenn Grossman declined to comment. Goldman has been steadily increasing its Venezuelan holdings in recent months, betting that a change in government could more than double the value of the debt if the country, which sits atop the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, reforms its economy, two of those familiar with the transaction said. The so-called PdVSA bonds that Goldman picked up last week had until recently been in the possession of Venezuela\u2019s central bank since they were issued in a private placement in late 2014. It is unclear, whom Venezuela sold the bonds to or how many investors held them before reaching Goldman. The Central Bank of Venezuela\u2019s international reserves jumped $442 million to $10.8 billion on Thursday, the day the bond deal was completed, according to official figures (para. 7-11).

The New York-based bank\u2019s asset management division last week paid 31 cents on the dollar, or about $865 million, for bonds issued by state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA in 2014, which mature in 2022, according to five people familiar with the transaction. The price represents a 31% discount on the trading Venezuelan securities maturing the same year. The investment comes as Mr. Maduro\u2019s detractors lobby hard to block Western financial institutions from doing transactions that support the cash-strapped government, which has been accused by the U.S. and other countries of widespread rights abuses. Mr. Maduro\u2019s increasing authoritarianism coupled with critical food and medicine shortages have spawned two months of almost-daily street demonstrations, costing at least 60 lives. The economy is also suffering, having shrunk 27% since 2013. Venezuela is saddled with what the International Monetary Fund estimates will be an inflation rate of 720% this year. The people familiar said the deal is part of the asset manager\u2019s steady increase in Venezuelan holdings. They said Goldman is betting that a change in government could more than double the value of the debt, which trades at deeply discounted rates with yields around 30% due to chronic default fears. A senior Venezuelan finance official confirmed the deal but declined to give more details. Goldman didn\u2019t negotiate the transaction with the government but instead bought the bonds through an unnamed broker, three of the people familiar with sale said. But detractors said participating in any financial deals would give much-needed funding to the Maduro administration, which polls show has the support of only one in five Venezuelans. The government has shelved elections and is now organizing an overhaul of the constitution, which opposition leaders say will end the few constitutional protections Mr. Maduro\u2019s political adversaries have. \u201cGoldman is putting itself on the wrong side of history with this deal,\u201d said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado, who is a member of the Venezuelan congressional finance committee, calling it \u201ca grave reputational error\u201d \u201cThis is a bad decision not just from the ethical, but also from the business perspective,\u201d he said. Mr. Alvarado added that an opposition-led administration, if it were to take power, would refrain from doing business with Goldman, whose asset management branch manages $1.3 trillion, of which about $40 billion is dedicated to emerging markets (para. 1-9).

They nearly lynched him, just because he shouted out that he was a 'Chavista',\" Maduro said, referring to the ruling socialist movement set up by his predecessor Hugo Chavez. Witnesses to the incident on Saturday afternoon, including a Reuters photographer, said the crowd had accused the man of being a thief. About 100 people, who had been participating in anti-Maduro protests, surrounded him, doused him in gasoline and set him alight in Plaza Altamira in east Caracas, the witnesses said. Though some in the crowd said he should die, others helped him and the man survived. Showing a video of the incident on state TV, Maduro identified the man as Orlando Figuera, 21, saying he was being treated in hospital for severe burns. Images from the scene showed him running near-naked with flames on his back. \"Burning a person because he seems a Chavista is a hate crime and a crime against humanity,\" Maduro said on his weekly TV program, also showing another video of someone being beaten up, as well as images of protesters throwing Molotov cocktails. The 54-year-old president says protesters are seeking a violent coup against him with U.S. help, and are increasingly persecuting \"Chavistas\" at home and abroad. Earlier this week, he compared it to the Nazi treatment of Jews. \"Venezuela is facing ... a coup movement that has turned into hatred and intolerance, very similar to Nazi fascism,\" he reiterated on Sunday.

The scenes, distributed around Venezuela on social media, showed a crowd smashing the sculpture on a curbside as others came to set a fire inside its shattered belly. But when the authorities rounded up suspects for the vandalism, they were not taken to an ordinary court. Instead, they were hauled off to a military base, where they faced the judges of a military tribunal this week. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, embattled by a second month of protests against his rule, has prosecuted political rivals under terrorism laws and expanded his powers by emergency decrees. His backers on the Supreme Court have even tried to dissolve the national legislature, which is led by the political opposition. Now, the president is turning to military courts to tighten his grip further, prosecuting demonstrators and other civilians in tribunals that the government closely controls. At least 120 people have been jailed by military courts since early April, when demonstrators began taking to the streets to call for new elections, according to Penal Forum, a legal group assisting those arrested. Another group monitoring cases, Provea, counted at least 90 people jailed by the military. Both groups contend that the country has never used the military courts against so many civilians this way outside of wartime. \u201cMilitary justice sows the greatest terror in our population,\u201d said Juan Miguel Matheus, an opposition congressman in the state of Carabobo, where he says at least 69 people have been jailed by the military since early April.

An entire family was arraigned before a military tribunal in Caracas this week and charged with inciting rebellion. In one case in the city of Valencia, two people were brought before military courts on suspicion of stealing legs of ham during a round of looting \u2014 then charged with rebellion as well, according to Penal Forum. \u201cThey are being treated like they are combatants,\u201d said Alfredo Romero, the director of the legal group. \u201cIt\u2019s taking civil jurisdiction and putting it in the hands of the military, like we are in a war.\u201d Many see another reason for the military crackdown against the protesters: The president\u2019s power is declining within his own leftist party, especially among its law enforcers.

Oil prices will be particularly sensitive to Venezuela\u2019s role in the next few months, with one of two extreme outcomes likely to occur, both of which will miss OPEC\u2019s target forecasts for Venezuela. In the first scenario, as Venezuela continues to prioritize debt servicing above all else, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro may find ways to marginally boost production, eroding the 8 percent of OPEC\u2019s planned production cuts the country accounts for. The second scenario would see an escalation of Venezuela\u2019s current crisis, preventing the country from importing the necessary light crude it needs to blend with its heavy oil. This would see Venezuela production falling below OPEC\u2019s predictions, providing a needed and unexpected boost to global oil supply cut efforts. In the near-term, Venezuela is set to surprise oil markets and potentially rock OPEC\u2019s plans, regardless of whether its production slips or Maduro finds a way to encourage developers to crank up drilling to generate quick cash. The drama unfolding in Venezuela is sure to come to a head as its next debt payments come due, and oil markets will be watching its production closely. PDVSA:\nThe way PDVSA operates, it is exploiting reserves so slowly as to render them, on average, worthless. If that\u2019s not bad enough, PDVSA is generating negative cash flows and piling up a mountain of debt. The arithmetic does not look good. PDVSA faces $10 bil. in interest and principal payments this year, but reports estimate that PDVSA only has $2 bil. in cash to service its debt obligations. In principle, the government could come to the rescue. A word from S&P: Pdvsa Default Risk Real, Outlook Negative, S&P Says\nS&P Global warned late Tuesday (February 2017) that Venezuela's default risk is real in 2017, but it affirmed its non-investment grade CCC foreign and local-currency sovereign credit rating with a negative outlook.\nCCC is considered a speculative category of debt, while CCC minus would indicate imminent default. Venezuela bonds produced handsome returns last year as default was averted, and the government shrugged off criticism for a late payment in November. The latest data show Venezuela  has roughly $10.5 billion left in reserves -- mostly gold and some cash - which is enough for  muddle-through year of debt payments,\nIn October 2016, PDVSA performed a distress debt exchange, which led us to lower our rating on PDVSA to 'SD' (selective default). In November, we raised the PDVSA rating to 'CCC-' with a negative outlook, reflecting S&P Global Ratings' expectation that PDVSA could default again in the first half of 2017. The company faces US$9.5 billion external debt service in 2017.

It may take months, years, or even decades, but eventually, they all come falling down. But until this collapse happens, the political turmoil will continue to complicate pending OPEC conversations and add an additional layer of uncertainty to the oil markets.

A Russian oil tanker with 249,000 barrels of refined products is due to arrive in Cuba on May 10, according to Reuters shipping sources and others, bringing back memories of when the Soviet Union supplied all of the Communist-run Caribbean island\u2019s energy needs. More tankers apparently will follow. Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil company, announced on Wednesday it had signed an agreement with Cuba\u2019s state-run Cubametals to supply 250,000 tonnes of oil and diesel fuel, without providing further details. The news is sure to raise eyebrows in Washington as its tense relations with Moscow continue, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign pledge to improve them. The Russian company has already become a concern for the United States. Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA last year used 49.9 percent of its shares in its U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, as collateral for loan financing by Rosneft. According to Jorge Pinon, an oil expert at the University of Texas at Austin, the Cuba deal is equivalent to around 1,865,000 barrels and valued at $105 million at current prices. In comparison, Russia reported it shipped oil products to Cuba from 2010 through 2015 valued at $11.3 million. Cuba consumes 22,000 barrel per day of diesel and 140,000 barrels per day of oil products. \"It is very clear that Cuba is diversifying its long-term supply contracts in the event that its October 2000 subsidized oil agreement with Venezuela is terminated,\" Pinon said. Cash-strapped Cuba struggled with long blackouts and fuel shortages after the fall the Soviet Union, but the rise of the late Venezuela leftist President Hugo Chavez quickly solved the crisis at the turn of the century. Since then Cuba has relied on Venezuela, an OPEC member, for about 70 percent of its fuel needs, including oil for refining and re-exports (para. 1-11). Frank, M. (2017).

We're almost getting inured to the images: smoldering barricades arrayed against riot police, security forces launching fusillades of tear gas, bloodied demonstrators being rushed out by volunteer medics. Embattled Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is grimly clinging to power. He recently announced plans to scrap the country's constitution and implement a new system that would further entrench his rule. His opponents \u2014 roused in March when the pro-government supreme court attempted to strip the opposition-dominated legislature of power \u2014 seek fresh elections, the release of political prisoners and other concessions. Maduro, the unpopular inheritor of a socialist revolution, shows no sign that he will heed those calls. \u201cMaduro is trapped in an electoral maze of the regime\u2019s own making,\u201d Phil Gunson of the International Crisis Group wrote last month. \u201cAfter years of using elections as plebiscites, confident that oil revenue and the charisma of the late strongman Hugo Ch\u00e1vez would always ensure victory, the government can now \u2014 with Ch\u00e1vez gone \u2014 neither muster the electoral support nor find a convincing reason not to hold a vote. And so the protests continue. Dozens have perished in clashes, and hundreds have been injured. A small minority of demonstrators have resorted to violence as Maduro mobilized armed gangs of loyalists, known as \u201ccolectivos,\u201d to counter the uprising. The security forces, my colleagues report, \u201cappear increasingly determined to choke the protest movement with brute force, including the use of copious amounts of tear gas. Several protesters have been killed or severely injured by gas canisters fired into crowds or allegedly dropped from government helicopters. Last week, a young man was injured when he was run over by an armored police vehicle that plowed through a melee.\u201d \u201cThe kids go out with just stones. That's their weapon. Now they have another weapon: excrement,\u201d a 51-year-old dentist said to Reuters while preparing containers of feces in her home. This revolting state of affairs is in part the consequence of a rolling economic crisis and recession. Since Maduro took office in 2013, Venezuela's economy has cratered, inflation has soared and Venezuelans have endured food shortages and blackouts that shuttered hospitals. As we wrote earlier, whole swaths of the population are reporting acute weight loss and a cutback in their daily meals. This week, the Venezuelan government published shocking new data: The country's infant mortality rose 30 percent last year, maternal mortality shot up 65 percent and cases of malaria jumped 76 percent (para. 1-8).

Oil rout driven by China, inventories and funds Ngai (2017) Fri May 5, states that: The plunge in crude oil markets this week to a six-month low was likely driven by worries about Chinese economic growth, persistently high inventories and fund positioning. U.S. crude oil CLc1 slumped by 5.0 percent to a low of $45.29 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest since November, when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day for six months from Jan. 1. However, Friday saw a 1.5 percent bounce helped by assurances by Saudi Arabia that Russia is ready to join OPEC in extending supply cuts to reduce a persistent glut. \u201cPeople often reverse-engineer an explanation. But, I think the velocity of the move this week stems from China and its liquidity tightening. That spooked the market across all commodities,\" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"It's a commodities story rather than oil-specific.\" Chinese manufacturing surveys this week triggered worries that the economic growth in the world's second largest economy may have peaked in the first quarter and China's central bank has moved to tighten credit leading to a fall in stock prices for the fourth straight week. Doubts that the OPEC-led supply cut of the past few months are deep enough to draw down bloated storage levels around the world are also weighing on prices. U.S. crude stockpiles fell less than expected last week as rising U.S. production offset reduced supply from OPEC. As a result, oil traders may have finally given up on an early re-balancing of inventories in the crude market by OPEC (para. 1-6). \nNgai, C. (2017). Oil rout driven by China, inventories and funds.

State-owned Saudi Aramco will reduce oil supplies to Asian customers by about 7 million barrels in June, a source told Reuters, as part of OPEC's agreement to reduce production and as it trims exports to meet rising domestic demand for power during the summer. Seven million barrels is roughly two days of oil imports into Japan, the world's fourth biggest importer. Aramco had previously been maintaining supplies to its important Asian customers (para. 1-3). It also fell 1.2 percent the previous session, and the closing price for both contracts on Tuesday was the second lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut production during the first half of 2017 (para. 6). While prices surged immediately after the agreement, in recent weeks they have come under sustained pressure as U.S. production has ramped up. Many are now pushing back the expected timing for when the oil market will come into balance after prices began slumping nearly three years ago (para. 6-8). Sheldrick, A. (2017).

A default would negate the very reason for its existence.  If the junta cannot hold on to power, then what would a counter-revolutionary interim government do? I assume that in the short term, they would have less motivation to keep international lenders happy. They might be able to count on emergency aid. But in the medium term, they, too, would need international financing. I.e. all players should be motivated to avoid default. The question is, can they?
