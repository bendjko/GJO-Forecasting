Early reviews for Civil War seem positive, but Winter Soldier still sits at 89% on Rotten Tomatoes and was a bit north of 90% when it opened to only $95M.  Reviews will impact word of mouth and the legs of the movie, but probably have little impact on opening weekend where fans have already decided they will see the movie or avoid the crowds the first few days. Marvel has established itself as a powerful brand in the movie market (the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU).  So there's a lot of comparables at http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=avengers.htm Factors in favor of Civil War opening > $166M:\n* More characters generally = more money.  Avengers opened to $207 (highest in MCU), Avengers 2 opened to $191 (2nd highest), and even Guardians of the Galaxy opened to $94M (7th highest but impressive given the August release and low name recognition of the characters prior to the film).\n* The MCU is the house that Tony Stark (or Robert Downey Jr) built.  The five highest opening MCU films are the five with Tony Stark/RDJ: Avengers 1 & 2 and the three Iron Man films.  While two of those movies opened under $166 they were the first two--Tony Stark's lowest opening weekend in three years is $174. Factors against Civil War opening  > $166M:\n* Captain America.  Despite both Captain America films being very positively reviewed, BOTH of the first two Captain America movies combined for opening weekends less than $166 ($65M and $95M).\n* Trendlines not in Cap's favor.  Cap's first movie opened at $65M.  HIs second at $95M.  That was a 46% improvement film over film.  Iron Man saw 31% and 36% improvement film over film so that 46% is impressive but with the lower initial opening there was more headroom.  That's still true given Winter Soldier's $95M opening.  But Civil War would need to improve 75% over Winter Soldier's opening to beat BvS--a feat that hasn't been accomplished since The Dark Knight improved on its predecessor by 229%.  Even X-Men: Days of Future Past only managed to beat First Class (also a low opener) by 64%. Many are also comparing Civil War to the Avengers.  The commercials and trailers certainly make a big deal of all the characters (especially Iron Man) and for good reason:\n* Avengers opened to $207, Avengers 2 opened to $191.  That was only a drop of 7%, which if Civil War is considered a third Avengers movie and has the same drop then it would exceed $177M.  \n* The $177M also assuming a similar drop which might not happen since Avengers 2 reviews were mixed while CIvil War reviews appear to be positive. However, it's entirely possible that movie goers outside the core fan base won't view this as an Avengers movie because of the title and because of Captain America (who is dominant in the advertising but has never had the same huge success as Iron Man).  And while there are many characters in this movie, several of them have been minimally used (Ant-Man, Falcon), at least one is new (Black Panther), and others set to appear haven't even been heavily featured in advertising despite previous appearances (Vision, Scarlet Witch).  One additional reason why movie goers may not consider this an Avengers film is the absence of Thor and Hulk.  Not only was Hulk a recognizable name, but both of those characters created visual moments that made the scale of the Avengers films grander than other MCU movies.  Instead we have a current action shot of a number of normal sized people jumping/running/flying at each other on an airport tarmac. Ultimately, I think the chances of Civil War outgrossing BvS on opening weekend comes down to two scenarios: State 1: Civil War is considered by the public to be Avengers 3.\nState 2: Civil War is considered by the public to be another Captain America movie. In State 1, it is highly likely a third Avengers movie could exceed $166M on opening weekend.  The first two movies did so, even despite the second movie's mixed word of mouth.  There is a generally favorable opinion of the MCU and Avengers which would also help its performance.  I would predict there to be a .90 chance that a third Avengers film beats $166M on opening weekend. In State 2, it is highly unlikely that a third Captain America movie exceeds $166M on opening weekend.  Only one superhero movie has been able to improve that much for a sequel (Dark Knight) and Civil War does not have the same core reasons for Dark Knight's success (media sensation of Heath Ledger's performance and low previous film opening).  Although the marketing efforts around Civil War want to equate the movie to Avengers, I think that ultimately falls short and is further indication that Marvel doesn't trust the opening power of Captain America alone.  I would predict there to be a 0.15 chance that a third Captain America film exceeds $166M. Now we have to look at the odds that the consuming public views the movie in either state.  The marketing is pushing towards State 1 but the success of the MCU, and particularly its increasing use of multiple characters within a film, are likely to make State 2 more likely.  I would predict that movie goers are 0.75 likely to view this as a Captain America movie. Chances that Civil War outgrosses BvS would therefore be: .90 State 1 success * .25 chance of State 1 + .15 State 2 success * .75 chance of State 2 = .3375 or 34%. UPDATE: The opening foreign numbers are starting to come in and international movie-goers are showing a much stronger preference for this to be treated like an Avengers movie rather than a Captain America movie.  That's a surprise given their failure to do so with Cap 2 but it had for fewer additional characters.  So I am updating the percentage change of State 1 to be .90 given the huge difference between Cap 3 and Cap 2 opening weekends in foreign markets. Additionally, if you compare the foreign openings of Cap 3 to Ultron you do see a slight decline (just as we saw a drop for Avengers 1 and 2).  These are difficult to compare as some have slight drops (Australia had $12.3M for Ultron, $10.6 for Cap 3), some are large increases (South Korea had $23M for Ultron, $29M for Cap 3), and some are large drops (UK had $27.3M for Ultron, $20.5 for Cap 3).  But given that a large drop would need to be consistent for a third Avengers movie, I am increasing the percentage of State 1 succeeding to .98.  So the new numbers look like: .98 State 1 success * .90 chance of State 1 + .15 State 2 success * .10 chance of State 2 = .897 or 90%"], [12763, "2016-05-02T15:54:56Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2016-05-02T15:39:42Z", [0.99], ""], [24601, "2016-05-02T15:34:09Z", [0.5], ""], [24600, "2016-05-02T15:10:32Z", [0.95], ""], [24592, "2016-05-02T14:26:08Z", [0.87], ""], [24206, "2016-05-02T13:39:27Z", [0.85], "With the overseas success..."], [23681, "2016-05-02T13:19:56Z", [0.9], ""], [21874, "2016-05-02T13:06:07Z", [0.86], "Batman v Superman was a disappointment.

After inversing the statement - will Captain America make at most 166mil, lot of forecasts would assign about 1-5% probability which is I think, too low.  Reason I don't think movie will make more than 166mil:\n1.) It will need to raise first week gains by roughly 75%, which never happend before considering Marvel movies\n2.) With series - % income increase rate tends to drop in most cases with adding new titles to existing series Reason why it can make more:\n1.) First Captain America was made by Paramount, scond and third are made by Buena Vista. Even when Avengers specifically wasn't the case, the increased opening week incomes for other Marvel movies (Iron Man, Thor) for which they got license after original producer.\n2.) The budget - opening week incomes relationship is very strong for Buena Vista. Strongest among all Marvel movie producers. Summary:\nIn total almost doubling opening week incomes is really challenging. Adding 1mil. to the budget can, based on former studies, add anywhere between 0.58$-1.33$ mil to final opening week outcome. In this case, that means to gain additional 70,983,626$ they would need to spent additional 53.4-122.3mil to previous budget. That would meen 220mil-292mil.

I can but, only when it pertains to the new Captain America franchise \"Civil War\" i'm afraid. Besides the fact that Batman v Superman was a tired pony from the start of the race as far as movie drum-up i.e., a lame opening weekend ticket gross domestically in the United States, Marvel just has bigger plans than the boys across the aisle. Marvel's film will exceed DC's opening weekend gross and it's thanks to the lads in the writer's room. This film has a very mediated tone potentially leading in many directions. Bucky Barnes, who is being pursued for his brain-washed actions in Captain America: Winter Soldier, takes on a number of Avengers, including Iron Man and Black Widow. This is a turning-point scene, as Bucky unloads a bullet from point-blank range at Tony Stark (Iron Man). This is a clear warning to the playboy genius that it's now a blood sport and there is no turning back. This scene is revealing a very provocative storyline future to come and if the whole film is on this level it will exceed well over $166,007,347 domestic which was the total gross for Batman v Superman in it's opening weekend. Furthermore, the DC Comic film's domestic gross was only 37.5% of its total lifetime gross. I cannot wait to see what this sequence throws into motion. One year after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, another incident occurs involving the Avengers resulting in collateral damage, enticing politicians to voice the need for closer management of such beings. And form a system of accountability and a governing body to determine when the Avengers are needed. When Steve Rogers (Captain America) attempts to protect Barnes and ends up in a conflict with Stark. The Avengers divide into two opposing leagues\u2014one led by Captain America, who wishes to operate without convoluting regulation, and the other by Iron Man, who can sees value in government sovereignty over the team. \n\n    This film becomes quite poetic once you begin to sense the euphemism for modern American political differences beneath the storyline's suggestive current. Captain America portraying the conservative struggle for a free and wholesome life and Iron Man resembling the liberal willingness to submit to government protection and equal benefit for all. This theme seems to paint the walls and canvases of Marvel's \"Civil War\" empire. Marvel stands to make a king's ransom from this picture domestically and abroad, a film of controversy and depth. \n"], [24058, "2016-04-19T03:12:08Z", [0.95], ""], [24057, "2016-04-19T02:58:19Z", [0.9], ""], [23889, "2016-04-19T02:07:40Z", [0.95], "Previousl;y I thought this was a low chance but after viewing Batman I realised this was a real possibility as I would expect the movie will be superior and the hype is considerable"], [21046, "2016-04-19T01:28:44Z", [0.95], ""], [18417, "2016-04-19T00:53:09Z", [0.9], "Superman has largely lost the gravity it once held over the American psyche.

HOWEVER, Avengers 2 did actually drop by $23m compared to the first. A similar drop would get us to $169m, so we're in choppy waters. I would not expect this to happen, Avengers 2's fall off was likely due poorer reviews, and CA3 does not seem to be getting this. However, this plus the lack on an actual Avengers title, I suspect, means this will be close. CA2 did $27m better than CA1. Another similar jump takes us to $123m. I think the jump will be higher than that, due to the extra draw of Iron Man, Spider Man etc. $160m+ is, however still a bit jump here. Ant Man and GOTG probably aren't that important comparisons, due to lack of existing characters. I'm not sure why I looked them up, but the numbers are there. RDJ's Iron Man is a big draw. His 3 solo films saw big jumps every time, and since he is featuring prominently on advertising, if we were to treat this as Iron Man 4 I would expect it to beat BVS. Just following the trend gets comfortably into Avenger's territory. The last 3 films featuring the character all beat BVS on opening weekend by a long way. I think this is the best argument in favour of a high %, and this is why I am going in so high. Spider-Man can be a big draw, but he isn't what he once was. The older films were pushing the BVS mark, but the newer ones are a long way down. May is pretty peak film releasing time, but I don't think it has big help over BVS here. There is little to compete with it, but there wasn't for BVS either. Finally, two forecasts I found from people predicting both films opening weekends before BVS came out. I am not sure of their methodology, but they seem to have both been broadly correct on BVS, suggesting some validity. http://pro.boxoffice.com/long-range-forecast-captain-america-civil-war/ This had CA winning very narrowly, but BVS beat its prediction. Possible CA will do that too. http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/03/batman_v_superman_and_captain.html This gave a similar figure for BVS, but predicts CA in the $140-$150m range. I think this is low. I suspect consensus is a little high due to overvaluing effects of reviews. BVS was panned, CA3 is doing well in these stakes. However, I'm not sure this makes a huge difference to opening weekends in franchises like this, and is more important later on via word of mouth. I'd be almost 100% confident CA3 will beat BVS in the long term. All in all, I'm reasonably confident that CA will beat BVS on opening weekend, but I think consensus is slightly too high here. If I were predicting blind, I would have maybe gone lower, and said maybe a 60-70% chance, but I don't want to gamble that much of my brier score on a topic I'm a bit ignorant of, so I'm going in comfortable below consensus, but hedging due to you all being so certain."], [10916, "2016-04-15T10:08:04Z", [0.94], ""], [10916, "2016-04-15T10:03:20Z", [0.99], ""], [22690, "2016-04-15T06:58:54Z", [0.96], "All reviews talking about CA3 as if its Avengers 3, an example being Spider-man character has apparently 30 mins in the movie.

Early reviews for Civil War seem positive, but Winter Soldier still sits at 89% on Rotten Tomatoes and was a bit north of 90% when it opened to only $95M.  Reviews will impact word of mouth and the legs of the movie, but probably have little impact on opening weekend where fans have already decided they will see the movie or avoid the crowds the first few days. Marvel has established itself as a powerful brand in the movie market (the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU).  So there's a lot of comparables at http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=avengers.htm Factors in favor of Civil War opening > $166M:\n* More characters generally = more money.  Avengers opened to $207 (highest in MCU), Avengers 2 opened to $191 (2nd highest), and even Guardians of the Galaxy opened to $94M (7th highest but impressive given the August release and low name recognition of the characters prior to the film).\n* The MCU is the house that Tony Stark (or Robert Downey Jr) built.  The five highest opening MCU films are the five with Tony Stark/RDJ: Avengers 1 & 2 and the three Iron Man films.  While two of those movies opened under $166 they were the first two--Tony Stark's lowest opening weekend in three years is $174. Factors against Civil War opening  > $166M:\n* Captain America.  Despite both Captain America films being very positively reviewed, BOTH of the first two Captain America movies combined for opening weekends less than $166 ($65M and $95M).\n* Trendlines not in Cap's favor.  Cap's first movie opened at $65M.  HIs second at $95M.  That was a 46% improvement film over film.  Iron Man saw 31% and 36% improvement film over film so that 46% is impressive but with the lower initial opening there was more headroom.  That's still true given Winter Soldier's $95M opening.  But Civil War would need to improve 75% over Winter Soldier's opening to beat BvS--a feat that hasn't been accomplished since The Dark Knight improved on its predecessor by 229%.  Even X-Men: Days of Future Past only managed to beat First Class (also a low opener) by 64%. Many are also comparing Civil War to the Avengers.  The commercials and trailers certainly make a big deal of all the characters (especially Iron Man) and for good reason:\n* Avengers opened to $207, Avengers 2 opened to $191.  That was only a drop of 7%, which if Civil War is considered a third Avengers movie and has the same drop then it would exceed $177M.  \n* The $177M also assuming a similar drop which might not happen since Avengers 2 reviews were mixed while CIvil War reviews appear to be positive. However, it's entirely possible that movie goers outside the core fan base won't view this as an Avengers movie because of the title and because of Captain America (who is dominant in the advertising but has never had the same huge success as Iron Man).  And while there are many characters in this movie, several of them have been minimally used (Ant-Man, Falcon), at least one is new (Black Panther), and others set to appear haven't even been heavily featured in advertising despite previous appearances (Vision, Scarlet Witch).  One additional reason why movie goers may not consider this an Avengers film is the absence of Thor and Hulk.  Not only was Hulk a recognizable name, but both of those characters created visual moments that made the scale of the Avengers films grander than other MCU movies.  Instead we have a current action shot of a number of normal sized people jumping/running/flying at each other on an airport tarmac. Ultimately, I think the chances of Civil War outgrossing BvS on opening weekend comes down to two scenarios: State 1: Civil War is considered by the public to be Avengers 3.\nState 2: Civil War is considered by the public to be another Captain America movie. In State 1, it is highly likely a third Avengers movie could exceed $166M on opening weekend.  The first two movies did so, even despite the second movie's mixed word of mouth.  There is a generally favorable opinion of the MCU and Avengers which would also help its performance.  I would predict there to be a .90 chance that a third Avengers film beats $166M on opening weekend. In State 2, it is highly unlikely that a third Captain America movie exceeds $166M on opening weekend.  Only one superhero movie has been able to improve that much for a sequel (Dark Knight) and Civil War does not have the same core reasons for Dark Knight's success (media sensation of Heath Ledger's performance and low previous film opening).  Although the marketing efforts around Civil War want to equate the movie to Avengers, I think that ultimately falls short and is further indication that Marvel doesn't trust the opening power of Captain America alone.  I would predict there to be a 0.15 chance that a third Captain America film exceeds $166M. Now we have to look at the odds that the consuming public views the movie in either state.  The marketing is pushing towards State 1 but the success of the MCU, and particularly its increasing use of multiple characters within a film, are likely to make State 2 more likely.  I would predict that movie goers are 0.75 likely to view this as a Captain America movie. Chances that Civil War outgrosses BvS would therefore be: .90 State 1 success * .25 chance of State 1 + .15 State 2 success * .75 chance of State 2 = .3375 or 34%. UPDATE: The opening foreign numbers are starting to come in and international movie-goers are showing a much stronger preference for this to be treated like an Avengers movie rather than a Captain America movie.  That's a surprise given their failure to do so with Cap 2 but it had for fewer additional characters.  So I am updating the percentage change of State 1 to be .90 given the huge difference between Cap 3 and Cap 2 opening weekends in foreign markets. Additionally, if you compare the foreign openings of Cap 3 to Ultron you do see a slight decline (just as we saw a drop for Avengers 1 and 2).  These are difficult to compare as some have slight drops (Australia had $12.3M for Ultron, $10.6 for Cap 3), some are large increases (South Korea had $23M for Ultron, $29M for Cap 3), and some are large drops (UK had $27.3M for Ultron, $20.5 for Cap 3).  But given that a large drop would need to be consistent for a third Avengers movie, I am increasing the percentage of State 1 succeeding to .98.  So the new numbers look like: .98 State 1 success * .90 chance of State 1 + .15 State 2 success * .10 chance of State 2 = .897 or 90%   I have entered another prediction with these numbers but wanted to update here as well."], [691, "2016-04-14T13:04:29Z", [0.97], ""], [19311, "2016-04-14T12:38:16Z", [0.97], "everything that needed to be said is in http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/206800 by @pietrokc"], [23889, "2016-04-14T12:26:02Z", [0.05], ""], [16421, "2016-04-14T05:50:59Z", [0.99], ""], [2, "2016-04-14T05:28:50Z", [0.75], "No change, but what a scathing article on Batman v.

So the base rate for \"Avengers movie beats BvS\" is 100%, but with only 2 data points. The base rate for \"movie beats BvS\" is essentially zero though. The base rate for \"Marvel movie beats BvS\" is about 10% (20% over last 8 years, since big reboots, feels more relevant). Not sure how to combine these. If you look at inflation-adjusted values, both Iron Man 3 and Spiderman 3 also beat BvS --- and both characters are in CW. (Reasonable to assume characters are main reason people see these?) Also, for the fans, Spiderman being in a movie with other heroes is a huge deal, we have been waiting forever. (I'd drag my face across a mile of broken glass just to hear that movie through a walkie-talkie.) But the fans might be a small number, maybe most people don't see it that way. It is tempting to discount BvS because critics panned it, but critics also panned Spiderman 3 and it's right up there in the biggest openings. Another way that CW might fail to beat BvS is by losing audiences to movies / events happening around the same time. There are no blockbusters coming out within 2 weeks of CW (before or after) [2,3]. On the other hand, NBA semifinals will happen that weekend [4]. Overall I'm pretty confident CW will beat BvS: 85% yes. (The 95% was a typo!)
