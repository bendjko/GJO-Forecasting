It's hard to see how anything that Trump would do at this stage would shock the nation enough for public opinion to push Democrats as a group towards impeachment.  While he has done many things that would have prompted impeachment proceedings for less bombastic, erratic, and ignorant leaders, Americans as a whole are ossified in their opinions. Many people who supported him will continue to do so no matter what he does, either because they support his crueler policies such as immigrant detention, or because they perceive benefit in his stacking of the courts with conservative judges that outweighs whatever they dislike. The people who oppose Trump will not change their minds but they are not growing in number and influence, nor do all of them see a need for impeachment proceedings. There are people who don't have enough interest or awareness of world and national events to care, and tend to view their lack of opinion as intellectually superior to support or opposition. They won't be reached in large numbers unless something drastic brings change to their personal lives and they can correctly recognize it as being a result of Trump's actions.  The most likely group to change their minds are former Trump supporters who are suffering economically due to Trump's trade war with China (particularly truckers and farmers) who may feel betrayed. However, there's a good chance of them not reassessing or changing their support due to the sunk cost fallacy and the fact that they've been indoctrinated into a worldview where liberalism and even other Republicans are untrustworthy and un-American. I think that some will vociferously support candidates who oppose Trump, but on the whole, it seems more likely that this group will feel jaded and merely withdraw from politics. I am also from rural America, and there is very much an attitude of resentment towards the perceived conventional political class which is dismissive and ignorant of problems in rural America, as well as a feeling of moral and cultural superiority based in large part on self-defining as a region in opposition to the perceived 'other' of people in more densely populated areas, whose lifestyles and problems rural America is as dismissive of as urban America is dismissive of rural America's problems. The media diet in rural America is also extremely right-wing and in the last decade or so has taken a sharp turn that way. Without exposure to other viewpoints except through the demonization and maliciously mocking misrepresentation in extreme right-wing media, people living in rural America have been lead to believe that they alone are seeing with clarity and have no good-faith interaction with other viewpoints.  I only give this possibility any points at all because there have been increasing stories of economic suffering in the communities that Trump pandered to for votes, which some of them correctly attribute to his trade policies and are angry about. (For example, the promised tax cuts have actually drastically increased the taxes that truckers must pay, because they no longer receive per diem budget for eating and other expenses while working. This presents immediate financial harm to this group, which might spur more of them to outright oppose Trump and his supporters as being in opposition to their best interests.)  However, it is likely that this narrative in the media is not reflective of the overall trend of public opinion in the group, because most people are unwilling to admit having been wrong about something they were passionate about for years.

On the Judicariay committee, the people who have come out in favor for impeachment are Steve Cohen, Cedric L. Richmond, Hakeem Jeffries, David N. Ciciline, Ted Lieu, Jamie Raskin, Joe Neguse, Greg Stanton, Madeleine Dean, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, Veronica Escobar, Sheila Jackson Lee, Mary Gay Scanlon, Eric Swalwell, and Val Demmings.   Which makes about 15 people on the committee, which means they need 9 more votes by August to have a fighting chance that [1]  And if there is going to be an impeachment to be passed through congress, they have to have 235 votes for it after the committee. Currently there are 83 congressmen that apparently support the impeachment. Which leaves a month for 153 votes to be put towards the impeachment. Knowing how they don\u2019t allow pork barreling anymore  makes it a lot harder to accumulate those votes.  Other Stuff: \nThere is another thing to note, the congressional recess is coming up in August, which lasts for the entire month of August.  That means all the votes need to be together in September. And there is one thing that has not been accounted for yet, Mueller, and he is planning on testifying on July 24th [2].  Baserate:\nBaserate is currently at 5%. I really think this is too low of score in the grand scheme of things but it is a little low considering the date of what is happening I think we are in the right range. After thinking about it again, with a month off right after Mueller testifies, I would go up with that information by 2% to about 8%.  Knowing that the amount of time to assemble the votes, the recess can swing either way depending on how it is covered and the information is disseminated out. But I would likely drop by 1% knowing how quickly the news cycle changes to 6%. But the time frame is bad given, we are a little too far out from election where it would be worth while to make a serious move such as this one.

I stick to my previous prediction, adding the fact, suggested in a comment by @anneinak, that the Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House (and a democrat), does not want to start the impeachment procedure for some of the reasons I stated in my first forecast. https://www.wsj.com/articles/muellers-exit-and-an-impeachment-alternative-11559256752"], [67419, "2019-06-14T20:26:48Z", [0.1], "The Democratic leadership has a very clear strategy of not supporting impeachment for a number of reasons: the process itself, their understanding of delivering what the people want, and their long-term strategy.  Firstly, it's an extremely laborious process. Because the elections are coming, the Democrat campaign would have to be focused on impeachment, which would take a very long time - if started now, it would probably take about a year, which is well into the campaign. (For instance, Nixon's impeachment took 10 months, from October 1973 until Augst 974). The energy and resources which are required to impeach would create a gap in the campaigning efforts that will be due at that point. It would make a negative campaign, rather than a constructive approach which is probably what the US wants. Secondly, the Democrats understand that the process would divide the country further. It would give Trump the chance to be seen as a victim, again as an outsider - much like his strategy in 2016. It would confirm that he is anti-establishment - and therefore, that the ones who remove him are the establishment, all that which the Clintons represented and was despised enough to allow Trump to win. Nancy Pelosi recognised this in her statement: \"Trump is goading us to impeach him. Every single day, he's just like taunting, taunting, taunting because he knows that it would be very divisive in the country, but he doesn't really care. He just wants to solidify his base.\"  Thirdly, an impeachment would make Mike Pence resdent. Not only do they not like him, but in this scenario, he would have the power to pardon Trump, which is probably the worst outcome, given the account of the crimes he has committed.  Rather than having him impeached, the Democrats want to see him behind the bars, as Pelosi declared 2 days ago: \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him impeached,\u201d Pelosi said to her Democratic colleagues. \u201cI want to see him in prison.\u201d At the moment, Pelosi is very powerful, and is against it and vehemently so. This judgement is explained by Jewel Hill: \"Impeachment is like putting a child in time out; imprisonment is like putting a child on punishment and taking away their video games, toys and outside privileges. A child learns more from being without nothing for a long time, rather than being in a corner and with everything for a short time.\"  Therefore, I forecast that as things are, there will not be an impeachment. The reason why I still forecasted a 10% chance, more than my peers, is because there is still one case scenario that might alter the picture. If Trump was to do something with huge consequences, such as invading Venezuela as an example, then that could shift the Republicans. It is only in a situation of bipartisan support that the Democrats would pursue an impeachment, because it would essentially mean that that is what the country wants. There could also be a theoretical shift among the Democrats that would start putting pressure on leadership for impeachment - hence my 10%.  https://ncatregister.com/15726/the-word/trump-should-be-imprisoned-not-just-impeached/\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/pelosi-impeachment-trump-congress/index.html"], [1333, "2019-06-14T18:18:57Z", [0.16], ""], [72713, "2019-06-14T18:05:52Z", [0.0], "Updating answer, not enough Republicans, and only 4 months left. \" It takes a vote of \u201ctwo-thirds of the Members present\u201d in the Senate to convict any federal officer subject to an impeachment charge, including the president.\" The two-thirds vote to convict means that 67 votes are needed in the 100-member Senate to remove the president and other federal officers from office.

In the last election cycle, the number of small donors increased significantly and many democratic candidates gained a significant amount of their campaign funding in the form of these small donations. Apparently, the diversification of funding can allow candidates to seek political positions that are somewhat more controversial, i.e. that of impeaching Trump, because they are rely less on a single donor and therefore a single set of opinions. There is no research showing how major donors relate to the issue of impeachment, and hence if some democrats funding could be endangered in the next election, but these diversified donations could perhaps indicate that more democrats are less bound by financial issues in their decision to support an impeachment process. However, as the Senate (naturally) still is not supportive of an impeachment and the potential political backlash remains extremely severe, I think Pelosi and the Democratic leadership will fend of an impeachment. Unless new and explosive allegations should surface. I.e. an impeachment seems very unlikely and I maintain a 5 % probability. \nSource: \nhttp://fortune.com/2019/06/13/donald-trump-impeachment-donors/"], [1333, "2019-06-13T18:39:24Z", [0.17], ""], [484, "2019-06-13T15:55:37Z", [0.0], "Down 10% in spite of insane (technical term) new normal."], [72017, "2019-06-13T15:25:29Z", [0.04], "Window closing."], [1056, "2019-06-13T13:55:16Z", [0.05], "Down even lower.

Thus, the impeachment process would have little chance of success. Pelosi fears that the American population would hold a failed impeachment spectacle against the Democrats, which in turn, could lead to a defeat in the upcoming presidential elections in Nov 2020.

Hence, parts of the democratic party now seem to be pushing for the impeachment process to support their other legal pursuits. However, despite this new avenue, the fear of the repercussions of a failed impeachment process still seems to be keeping a heavy-weights in the democratic party in opposition to the impeachment process.

This is despite the fact that several other Democratic leaders have pushed for the impeachment process to begin, Pelosi and her allies apparently argued in a leader meeting that the impeachment would damage the party and drown the parties message. It is Pelosi's understanding that the majority of the Democratic House does not want to impeach the President, however the parties most radical and hard-handed are putting growing pressure on the House Speaker. This internal Democratic battle over impeachment started after the White House formally declared that former White House counsel Don McGahn \u2014 whom is a key figure in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation \u2014 would not attend a Tuesday hearing before the Judiciary Committee. This has led several Democratic House members to give statements where they say that if McGahn does not show up to the Tuesday hearing, impeachment inquiries are more likely to occur (https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/nancy-pelosi-impeachment-1336587). Even though Mr. McGahn did not show up to the hearing, no official steps have been taken towards an impeachment article. However, it appears that several House Democrats are calling for an impeachment inquiry into the president (https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/democrats-impeachment-whip-list/index.html).

I have read many of the posts and will ping mostly off SRM-Nostradamus who's forecast analysis narrative was rather in-depth.   I agree that there is no precedence in American history for a successful bid to impeach a sitting President.  There is also a growing polarization within politics unlike anything I have seen in 50 years.  The calls for impeachment over the past two years have come with numerous rationalizations up to and including invoking the 25th Amendment - calling Trump mentally incapable.  This alone gives the impression of political rhetoric designed to whip up the frenzy of the opposing political party.  There was much anticipation that the Muller report would be the smoking gun needed to garner more wide-spread/main stream support for impeachment proceedings.  Both sides of the political aisle have claimed a victory in the released Mueller report, but nothing in the report or anything reported in the news (CNN, MSNBC, FOX, NYT, Wash Post) has lead me to believe there is enough evidence to conclude Trump colluded in anyway.  There is also not enough information to support a conclusion that he obstructed the investigation, though there are hints and innuendo.  However, hints and innuendo are insufficient to persuade a Grand Jury to indict.   The recurring calls for Trump's impeachment now appear to be nothing more than the political bantering of candidates and representatives who want to continue to appeal to the emotions of their fringe voters during the primary season.  The seasoned members of the party seem to be weighing this and realize this is actually a political hot potato.  Trump has high approval ratings in many polling districts, has wide appeal to the rust belt and fly-over states, has produced economically beneficial activities that have helped the minority communities - who now show greater support for Trump than any other Republican President in modern history.  These are historically Democratic voters that the Democratic party will need to court in the 2020 election.  Impeachment proceedings may have a very big boomerang effect with them.  This has the appearance of the fringe elements of the Democratic left being the drunk little guy in the bar at the end of the night picking fights he knows he won't get in because his bigger tougher friend will save him from himself.   There is also the issue of the rebound effect - the same reason the Democrats did not use the \"nuclear option\" several years ago as they knew it would set a new precedence and could open the door to the opposing party using that option in the future.   I also see the Attorney General's investigating the origins of the Page Dossier, and the tactics of the Mueller investigation as a sign that upon further independent review there was politically motivated impropriety, giving greater weight to the notion that no evidence whatever exists to support criminal charges or impeachment for anything - making an attempt to do so look like a kangaroo court.   All this leads me to believe that there is less than a 10% chance that the Democratic party will initiate impeachment proceedings.  However, there are a large number of young, politically inexperienced, idealistic freshmen congressmen who, without the benefit of political savvy and connective thinking could pressure the party at large to initiate proceedings - much the same way they have been pressuring many of the presidential candidates in their party to apologize for decades old slights.

Clinton in 1999. In both cases, the Senate disapproved the filed articles of impeachment and acquitted the accused presidents. Andrew Johnson remained in the parliament because 7 republican senators decided to reject the impeachment proposal by their party. They were convinced that the impeachment of Andrew Johnson was political motivated rather than based on constitutional concerns. The Clinton impeachment failed for similar reasons. Some republican senators who, despite condemning the president\u2019s behaviour, opposed to impeach the president as they didn\u2019t assess Clinton\u2019s behaviour as unconstitutional. These developments show that there is a nonpartisan consensus that a president shouldn\u2019t be impeached for political motivated reasons. This is relevant for this forecast as it demonstrates that Trump doesn\u2019t face a risk to be forced out of office due to his unpopularity among US citizens and policy-makers. There are two decisive factors which influence the probability that a filed article of impeachment will be successful in the House of Representatives:  A) Majority within the House of Representative willing to impeach president? \n-> The Democratic Party currently holds the majority in the House of Representatives with 235 seats against 199 Republican seats. This means, that the party could impeach Donald Trump if 218/235 of its members support an impeachment. Nevertheless, there aren\u2019t enough members in the Democratic party who support an impeachment of president Trump so far. The House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have rejected to file for an article of impeachment in the recent years. The former one stresses that the next presidential election will take place in 18 months anyway. Indeed, a factor which reduces the likelihood over time that anti-impeachment Democrats will change their mind till the end of the term. Another aspect is that an impeachment procedure would need to pass the Senate which is majority-owned by the Republican party. As a result, the risk to see an article of impeachment fail in the Senate might be too high to motivate sceptical Democrats in the House to vote for an impeachment. Furthermore, these Democrats are also concerned that Trump could successfully instrumentalize a failed impeachment attempt for his re-election campaign. However, there is a factor which might increase the likelihood for them to change their minds: the full disclosure of an unedited Mueller report which proves that the president behaved unconstitutional.  -> Justin Amash is the first Republican congress member who supports the impeachment of Donald Trump. He has changed his mind after he read the Mueller report (see below) and concluded that the president \u201cengaged in specific actions [that] meet the threshold for impeachment\u201d (requoted from BBC; addition in [] made by BBC). He also claims that only a few congress members read the report but that a majority base their support/opposition for an impeachment solely on \u201cpartisan affiliation\u201d. Indeed, the Republican party faces criticism for supporting Trump without reserve despite some moral questionable activities done by the president. This support seems to be too strong for a significant amount of Republican congress members voting for an impeachment against the president.  B) Possible future inquiries that increase/decrease the likelihood of an impeachment? \n-> The most important inquiry which could create a momentum against Donald Trump would be the publication of evidences for a collusion between the US president and Russia to influence the US election or proof that Trump intentionally tried to obstruct justice. For this purpose, the FBI conducted an investigation which resulted in the so-called \u201cMueller report\u201d. The report was initially summed up and presented by Attorney General William Barr. The Democratic party accuses the Attorney General of deliberate misrepresentation to reduce the importance of the findings and protect the president of an impeachment. The report \u201cfound no criminal conspiracy between Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign and Russia. However, it did find 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation\u201d (quote BBC). Nonetheless, so far there is no unredacted version of the report and Barr successfully refuses to publish one. Furthermore, the Attorney General initiated an investigation to examine if the FBI obeyed to US law while they had been investigating on a possible collusion. This means that it is less likely that any decisive events (such as a reveal of an unredacted version) will happen before the 1st of October 2019.  Another reference case to consider would be the one of Nixon. While not being technically impeached, the House Judiciary Committee proposed three articles of impeachment for the congress to consider. Nixon left the office before the congress could make a decision. Nonetheless, trying to forecast if Donald Trump would resign as US president due to the pressure of an impeachment procedure is difficult as it depends on various important variables/aspects which are completely unknown at the time of this forecast (e.g.: did the president conduct criminal activities?). So far, Donal Trump claims that he isn\u2019t concerned of an impeachment. Therefore, this forecast assumes that Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t step down if he faces an impeachment.   To conclude, there are only two cases where the House of Representative passed an article for impeachment and in both cases the Senate failed the attempts based on concerns that they are only political motivated. Although the Democratic party has a majority in the House and could pass an impeachment proposal it seems very unlikely that all Democratic congress members would support this move. On the other hand, there aren\u2019t enough Republican congress members who could substitute this loss and it also seems very unlikely that this will change soon. The only real \u2018game changer\u2019 is a full disclosure of the Muller report which provides enough momentum to carry an article of impeachment through both chambers of the congress. However, this seems unlikely itself (regarding the lack of evidence for a collusion) and it is also very unlikely to take place before the 1st of October as the Attorney General successfully delayed disclosure so far and started new investigations which might undermine the Mueller report in the first place. The remaining probability relies on the possibility that the Mueller report will be released soon and that it contains enough evidence for an article of impeachment based on obstruction of justice.

These numbers are especially interesting in relation to similar polls conducted in 1998, when then President Clinton was facing impeachment. Here, ABC/Washington Post Poll found that 40% of the respondents agreed with the impending impeachment, whereas 60% were opposed to it. These numbers are interesting to note, because the failure of the Clinton impeachment, and the president\u2019s subsequent rise in popularity, has been cited as one of the reasons why leading democrats are holding back on initiating the process. However, the polls indicate that President Clinton held a stronger public sympathy than Trump currently does. This means that back-lash, in terms of a popularity gain, that the democrats fear an impeachment process would result in, might not be as likely an outcome. This support the loud voices, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, who are publicly pushing for impeachment.  That being said, it seems that the democrats are not rushing into an impeachment process. Instead, Pelosi is seemingly taking a course of framing their future actions and investigations meant to protect the constitution and the political integrity of the American system. Thereby, Pelosi seems more concerned with establishing unity in her democratic caucus than with the impeachment.  I chose to raise my probability of 5% to 8%, keeping in mind that the house is currently not on clear path to impeachment and that the time frame of this questions in set to before October 1st.

The efforts to finally impeach Donald Trump have been initiated several times already due to different issues and even though we\u2019ve heard different stories of his impeachment during the last 3 years, I do believe there\u2019s low likelihood that the US House of Representatives will pass an article of impeachment against President Trump before October 1, 2019. First of all, after the findings in Mueller report were revealed, last poll regarding Trump\u2019s impeachment still states that the majority of Americans believe that the report should not cause impeachment hearings against Trump. Only 39% claims that Congress must start impeachment hearings. The Mueller report itself included one of the most important controversies we\u2019ve heard surrounding Trump \u2013 Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential elections \u2013 and proved that the allegations weren\u2019t false, the interference in the elections indeed occurred and violated the US criminal law. The report itself doubts the legitimacy of Trump\u2019s presidency and if he can \u201csurvive\u201d this, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s something more significant on the agenda right now that can actually make the US house of representatives pass an article for the impeachment.  Second, since 2019 the risks of his impeachment have increased due to the fact that the Democrats have gained control over the House. In 2017 and 2018 the Republicans controlled both the House and Senate and it\u2019s easy to guess why no significant measures were taken against Trump. In 2017 Democrats even initiated Trump\u2019s impeachment for violations of the foreign emoluments\u2019 clause of the constitution. However, to actually remove Trump from presidency, the US House of Representatives can only pass an article of impeachment (that needs a simple majority of votes) for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. The senate is actually the institution that is able to impeach the president, since the Senate votes to punish the individual or not (a two-third majority of the senators need to vote \u201cguilty\u201d). The two-third majority of votes will be quite difficult to achieve since 53 members of the 116th US congress are from Republican Party and as of today, Trump\u2019s approval within the Republicans is still 90%. Finally, looking into the history of the US, we see that there were only two impeached US presidents \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. The house of Representatives charged them with committing \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d. However, the Senate didn\u2019t convict neither of them. Hence, until now there has not been a president that\u2019s been removed from the office using the impeachment process.  Taking into consideration the major points discussed above, the House of Representatives should be able to predict what are the actual chances of Trump\u2019s impeachment nowadays and, therefore, shouldn\u2019t present an article that most likely won\u2019t result in Trump\u2019s removal from the office.

Several factors are likely to force their hand: (1) The progressive wing of the party that believes Trump should be impeached no matter the political cost to the party in red and swing states, (2) a need to de-legitimize the Trump presidency both to score political points and mitigate the impacts of what they argue are dangerous policies, and finally, (3) a sense of duty to uphold the rule of law and fulfill Congress' oversight role over the Executive branch. In this climate, it's possible that future revelations from ongoing Congressional investigations, the unredacted Mueller report, and public testimonies from key actors related to the Mueller report may the turn the tide of popular opinion on impeachment. This may give Democratic leadership the political cover they need to pursue Articles of Impeachment in the House of Representatives. The biggest question thus is whether political opinion will change enough in favor of impeachment before 1 October 2019, and that, in turn, will be at least partially determined by how grave and shocking are future revelations about the conduct of Trump and his administration (50% likely). It will also be facilitated in part by whether Republicans are able to get behind a plan B candidate for the next election. Mike Pence has done enough as VP to associate himself with Trump that he may be acceptable to the Trump's base if Trump is out of the picture, but this would be a very unlikely scenario (5% likely). It will also depend on overcoming the fundamental inertia of American public opinion - certainly a significant challenge when it comes to something as serious as impeachment (15% likely). Given the number of things that need to happen before the Democratic leadership is willing to pursue Articles of Impeachment, there is a very low chance that they will do so before October of this year. However, chances are slightly higher given the roughly even probability that there will be further shocking revelations about Trump.

Trump said on Sunday that he was against special investigator Robert Mueller being questioned by Congress about his final report on the Russian investigation. The Democrats should not be allowed to repeat the investigation.  The president reacted with his statement to the news that the Legal Affairs Committee had provisionally set May 15 as the date for the hearing. Trump had only said on Friday that the question of whether Mueller should testify had to be decided by Justice Minister William Barr. However, Barr had recently argued in the hearing before the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee that the White House had the right to refuse to testify before Congress to current and former members of the Presidential Office. That is part of the executive privilege. It is expected that this matter, as well as the refusal to submit the unprocessed final report, will go to court. The House Judiciary Committee would particularly like to summon Don McGahn, former White House counsel, to clarify the question Mueller left open in his final report: Was Trump guilty of obstructing justice? Mueller had described ten episodes in the report in which Trump tried to influence the Russian investigation. Although the member of congress have access to the full report in a classified room, they have not yet been able to publicly use the information, such as information on ongoing court cases.   Democrats refer to the landmark Supreme Court ruling in the Watergate affair, in which Richard Nixon's reference to executive privilege was rejected. As a result, the then president had to hand over his tape recordings from the Oval Office, whereupon he resigned in a courteous impeachment procedure. The Democrats are divided over an impeachment against Trump. Some of the senators and deputies would like to charge him if the parliamentary inquiry confirms the accusation of obstruction of justice. Nancy Pelosi, the \"spokeswoman\" of the House of Representatives, rejects this with reference to the majority situation in the Senate, which would prevent the dismissal of the president (https://edition.faz.net//faz-edition/politik/2019-05-07/trump-gegen-aussage-muellers-vor-dem-kongress/304081.html/). Due to the lastest developments, I return to my original forecast's estimation of 10%. Chances of the House of Representatives passing an impeachment article against seem still low.

Trump is in the 'lame duck' session, same as Clinton when he was impeached, so if using analogous reasoning, one could draw parallels there. However, the time limit is key here. The gears of justice grind slowly, and in the pursuit of winning over voters (specifically those who may have voted for the President) Democratic candidates may not find an impeachment to be a strategically advantageous move.

There are historical and practical reasons behind that. \nFirst, throughout the history of the United States, there were two cases when the president was impeached by the House (Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998). The third case of Richard Nixon was not completed, as he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment. Hence, even though the demands for impeachment, especially of presidents, are quite common, the actual impeachment is a rare event in the U.S. \nSecond, as for Trump, demands to impeach him is nothing new. The talks about impeachment against him had begun before Trump took office, while actual efforts to impeach Trump were initiated already during the first year of his presidency back to 2017. As it is known by now, it did not turn into any impeachment proceedings so far.\nThird, many experts agreed that at the beginning the impeachment was barely possible practically as Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate. After 2018 elections, when Democrats won control over the House, the expectations about the impeachment have increased. However, even though Democrats have a majority in the House and an actual opportunity to pass an article of impeachment against Trump, it looks like it is still very unlikely to happen before October 2019. Throughout the last 5 months, even though they had a majority, Democrats didn't initiate the impeachment. What is more, from the latest news is known that the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi urged her fractious rank and file to avoid a broad, open-ended impeachment inquiry as it might backfire for the Democrats in 2020 elections. To my mind, the House could use other punishing tools towards Trump, avoiding the risky option of impeachment. For instance, a Chairman of the Intelligence Committee mentioned another possible way of striking back by using using the so colled House\u2019s power of the purse. \nForth, I am taking into account the period of time. As the question on impeachment is due October 2019, it also contributes to decline in chances for Trump to be impeached. \nTo sum up, as I argued before, the impeachment of Trump is very unlikely. However, I leave 5% chance for it to happen. On my previous argumentation, I deliberately tried to avoid the analysis of specific accusations to Trump as, to my mind, it creates a lot of extra noise that very often misleads the prognosis itself as we tend to give more weight on the impact when it actually has. To my mind, if there is a strong political will, the evidence against Trump might be sufficient to pass an article of impeachment. Especially, adding the latest news of Trump family lawsuit to block oversight of its finances (Subpoenas). Moreover, many compare Trump to Nixon, seeing the same pattern of obstruction of justice by using the power to limit the access to witnesses and documents. However, to sum all the arguments up, I still find it very unlikely to happen.  Sources: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_impeach_Donald_Trump\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/02/opinions/trump-impeachment-isnt-like-clinton-its-nixon-lockhart/index.html"], [67414, "2019-05-04T12:29:14Z", [0.01], "I find it extraordinarily unlikely at this moment in time that the U.S. House of Representatives will pass an article of impeachment against President Trump. The House could easily pass this resolution based on their finding of the Mueller Report. The Report specifically left it to Congress to make a judgment on obstruction of justice and gave a pile of evidence that could be used to make this judgement. This in and of itself presents valid grounds for impeachment as Bill Clinton was impeached in part on grounds of obstruction of justice and Nixon was going to be impeached in part on grounds of obstruction of justice. There are also 16 other investigations that involve Trump and these may also yield impeachable charges. Moreover, The Democrats have a majority in the House and passing an article of impeachment only requires a single member to bring to the floor and only takes a simple majority to pass. In this sense if enacted the actual process will undoubtedly result in an article of impeachment being passed. However, Democrats are not willing to enact this process, making it unlikely that Trump will be impeached by October 2019. There are several reasons why Democrats will not enact the procedure. First, impeachment is just the process of determining whether to send the president and other federal figures to trial. The House has no power in actually removing these figures, that relies wholly in the Senate and to be removed from office the Senate needs to have a trail and then a 2/3 majority is required to find the figure guilty and should be removed from office. This is why no president and very few federal figures have actually been removed, it requires bi-partisan agreement on the issue. Currently, if the Senate were to hold a trial Trump would not be removed. So let's assume all democrats and independents would vote to remove Trump, something unlikely as some Senators from traditional red states like Doug Jones from Alabama or Joe Manchin  from West Virginia  might feel pressure from their constituents to vote no, something already seen in the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh. But if all Democrats and independents were to vote for removal, that would only be 47 votes and 66 are needed, meaning 19 Republicans would also have to vote for removal and there are only 2 republican senators who have show some willingness to vote against party lines, those be Lisa Murkowski from Alaska and Susan Collins from Maine. Then you have three other potential Republicans have yet to seriously break party line, but may receive enough pressure from their constituents to vote for removal, those are Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania, Ron Johnson from Wisconsin and Cory Gardner from Colorado. These states had a historically strong showing for democrats in the Midterms, thereby this could put alot of pressure on these Republican Senators. However, this is only 5 Republican Senators who could conceivably vote for removal, which is far short of the needed 14. The remaining Republicans have consistently shown a willingness to ignore any allegations against Trump and continue to blindly pin their political careers on Trumps success and it would take indisputable, damning evidence for them to vote for removal. Yet, this evidence already exists and if it was any other president, especially democrat, the Senate would have alreadry voted to remove the president. Therefore, the shear number of scandals and allegations of Trump have numbed Republicans to the point where they don't care anymore. They've gone from a party that 20 years ago could not stand a President who received a blowjob and lied about it, to completely ignoring any present wrong doings in the White House. Therefore, even if the articles of impeachment are passed in the House, Trump will not be removed.  Democrats, Especially Nancy Pelosi understand this and therefore they will not bring up impeachment charges, because they know that in the end Trump will not removed and the Senate's decision will essentially be an exoneration of his actions, meaning that Democrats will have lost this battle the will not be able to renew charges and it will severely tarnish the checks and balances system by essentially proving that Presidents can get away with almost anything and not be removed from office. Therefore, passing articles of impeachment would solely be a political move and nothing productive would come from this. Thereby, Pelosi has kept a tight reign and will continue to keep a tight reign on House Democrats to prevent them from bringing up the articles of impeachment.  Secondly, as previously stated, their are so many scandals and investigations into Trump, that not only have Republicans become numb to it, but so have many voting Americans, they no longer want to hear about all the awful things Trump has done and they find it complete overkill at this point. Therefore, Democrats with their eyes on the 2020 election recognize that passing articles of impeachment would likely be more harmful for them, because that would be what people hear from the media and it would drown out policy issues and crucial voters will turn off. They'll see a combative democratic party that continues to beat the same drums they've been beating for 5 years and won't listen. They won't see Democratic candidates as being a party for the people who are proposing sweeping changes, they'll just see them as the anti-trump party and this will not convince the essential voters to get up and vote and then vote for democrats.  Many top democrats, like Pelosi, have already voiced this concern and would prefer to hold Trump accountable through elections. Then after the elections they'll either be stuck with Trump for four more years and will have no other option but to use their power and authority to try an remove him or Trump will lose and then charges can be brought against an ex-president who doesn't have any official power to prevent justice.   Therefore, I claim that there is only a 1% chance that the House will pass articles of impeachment by October 1st, because it's not impossible, but Democrats have already voiced that this is not a good option and it makes no political sense due to the fact it has far more potential to harm Democrats than benefit them. All this said, the current democratic position may change if more and more evidence against Trump is revealed and they face more and more pressure from their constituents, or even if republicans start to miraculously abandon  the president. However, at this moment in time there is no indication of this and therefore the probability of a successful impeachment process by October 2019 remains astronomically low.

The senior Democratic lawmakers, who voted in favor of impeachment articles from Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) in the last Congress, are largely toeing their leadership\u2019s line of caution, saying committees should move forward with investigations of Trump.   The committee leaders who voted in favor of Green's impeachment articles in 2017 and 2018 either once or both times include Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (N.Y.), Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (Mass.), Science Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (Texas), Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (N.J.), Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (N.Y.) and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra\u00fal Grijalva (Ariz.). Engel and Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) are both leading investigations of Trump; Waters is notable in having called for Trump\u2019s impeachment before and after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Engel, who backed impeachment in separate votes in 2017 and 2018, echoed Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a conference call earlier this week with Democrats. Engel said that Democrats \u201cshould be cautious\u201d with impeachment, according to a source on the call, while explaining how his panel is investigating Russian interference. \u201cWe need to look at this bizarre relationship between Putin and Trump,\u201d Engel said during the call. He added that he\u2019s directing staff to inform foreign governments that do business with Trump hotels that they may be contributing to a violation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which is an issue that progressives like billionaire activist Tom Steyer have cited in calling for impeachment.  Johnson, who also voted in favor of Green\u2019s impeachment resolution, took a similar tack. \u201cImpeachment is a sacred constitutional responsibility entrusted to Congress. I am committed to continuing to conduct oversight into the president\u2019s conduct and wrongdoing as well as serving as a check on the president. This is what House Democrats were elected into the majority to do, and this is what we will do while Senate Republicans repeatedly show that they are willing to look the other way,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.  McGovern deferred to the Judiciary Committee but didn't rule out the prospect of impeachment. \"He trusts Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler\u2019s leadership on this issue. But given Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s report and the president\u2019s continued stonewalling of Congressional oversight requests, he doesn\u2019t believe any options should be taken off the table,\" McGovern spokesman Matt Bonaccorsi said. Two members of Democratic leadership who, like Green, are members of the Congressional Black Caucus, at one point or another supported the efforts. Green alleged in his articles of impeachment that Trump was inflaming racial tensions in America. House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) voted in favor of Green's articles of impeachment in 2017 but joined other Democratic leaders the second time in voting to table them. The votes forced by Green drew the support of 58 Democrats the first time and 66 a month later, but the majority of his colleagues joined leadership in rejecting the efforts. \u201cHis vote in 2017 was to express his disapproval of the president on the record,\u201d Clyburn spokeswoman Hope Derrick said. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), voted to table Green's articles the first time but voted in favor of them in January 2018 after Trump came under fire for deriding protections for immigrants from \u201cshithole\u201d African countries. Democratic chairmen face some pressure to back Pelosi, who has argued it would be unwise to move forward with impeachment given the likelihood that the Republican Senate would not convict Trump. Pelosi also remembers how impeachment boomeranged on House Republicans in the Clinton era. Most of the calls to move forward on impeachment have come from liberal members of the Democratic caucus. Pelosi is worried impeachment could be used by Republicans against many of the vulnerable Democrats who won swing districts in 2018. Waters is one committee chair who backed Green\u2019s call for impeachment when Democrats were in the minority, and has kept her position in the majority. In the wake of Mueller\u2019s report, she said she still supports impeachment.  \u201cMueller kicked the impeachment ball to the Congress. The Constitution gives the responsibility to Congress to impeach an unfit president \u2014 'high crimes and misdemeanors.' What more do we need? #impeach45,\u201d Waters wrote in a series of tweets this week.  She also made a point of noting that impeachment is in House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler's (D-N.Y.) court, writing that \u201cDems divided. The impeachment resolution must start with & be taken up by the Judiciary Committee. Rep. Nadler is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\u201d Nadler, as well as Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), did not vote in favor of Green's efforts. Thompson, meanwhile, notably retweeted a message from Green last week calling for impeachment. A spokesman for Thompson did not return requests for comment. Other committee leaders who voted in favor of Green's articles in the past avoided mentioning the word impeachment at all when reacting to the release of Mueller's report and instead joined calls for the full, unredacted version of the special counsel's findings. Both Pallone and Velazquez cast doubt on Attorney General William Barr and said they wanted to see Mueller testify before Congress.

The US constitution lists \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d as reasons for impeachment; evidently the charges have to be very grave to warrant such an article to pass. \nWhile Trump has been an extremely polarizing president since he took office, and has been surrounded by serious allegations of financial crimes and Russian collusion since then, several key factors need to be considered. \nFirstly, the result of the recent Mueller report (in the form of the summary that has been made available to the public) did not establish a connection between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Consequently, it failed to give the President\u2019s opponents a secure proof of Russian ties and as of now does not seem like grounds for taken such political action. \nThis has been supported by the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, who has expressed her hesitancy in relation to an impeaching the president, underlining the dividing effects such a decision would have on the country. That being said, there are still significant forces in the democratic party supporting impeachment, and their further actions will likely be dependent upon the both the results of the investigation ongoing investigations (e.g. the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign and finances), as well as on how the Mueller report will play out, when/if it is released in its full length. \nMoreover, it could be damaging for the democrats to initiate an impeachment process in the house, only to have it rejected by the senate. Especially this close to an election. Additionally, there would need to be a strong, broad, public support for the impeachment, across party lines, which does not seem to be the case currently. \nOn the basis of the rarity of impeachments in the past, the vagueness of the result of the Mueller report, and the reluctance of top democrats to support an impeachment of the sitting president, I deem this event very unlikely. \n"], [71731, "2019-04-14T12:55:24Z", [0.25], ""], [71549, "2019-04-14T12:39:58Z", [0.2], "I think the most viable options for potential impeachment have been and gone.

The reason it is higher than 0 is that Trump has already passed the threshold of actions at which previous presidents were impeached. E.g. Clinton. This fact alone raises the probability above 0. However, the democratic leadership (Pelosi, specifically) has indicated strongly that they do not intend to impeach Trump, so there would need to be a catalyzing event that would change the House Leadership's mind in order for impeachment proceedings to go ahead. This counterweight lowers the probability of impeachment to near 0, but not all the way to 0 due to the possibility of a \"Black Swan\" catalyst changing the political calculus during the timeframe of this forecast. Impeachment is a political act and Pelosi has shown a lack of political will to take this act under current political conditions. This brings us on to catalyzing events that could, in fact, lead to impeachment: What might those events be? There are two types. 1. A change of leadership in the house. This is highly unlikely in the time frame and can be ruled out. 2. The release of new information pertaining to Trump's \"guilt\". While this information may exist in the real world, there's no obvious mechanism (currently) for its release. Moreover. Even were such information to be released, Trump has a track record of disavowing information (whether it is true or not) that shows him in a negative light. When he disavows negative information he continues to carry about 40% of the country with him and we've probably reached the point where there's no disclosure of information that would change the mind of this 40%. This 40% all but guarantees that Republican leadership in the house would stick with Trump, even in the event of potentially \"extreme\" revelations about him - and the loyalty of the house Republicans to Trump, along with the risk of political violence in the event of impeachment has the House Democrats convinced that impeachment is a counter-productive path for them to pursue for Trump's removal, even if \"smoking gun\" evidence were to be released, itself a highly unlikely outcome in the first place. The reason for the dem's strategy of \"don't impeach\" under any new information disclosure scenario is four-fold 1. Senate Republican support would be required for a conviction (this is unlikely in the extreme) 2. Previous impeachments have not benefitted the impeaching parties in polls (Clinton / Starr) 3. There's a non-trivial risk of political violence, instigated in part by Trump, in the event of impeachment proceedings going ahead. This violence could negatively impact democrats's ability to regain power in a foreseeable time frame. 4. The threat of impeachment without actually going ahead with it is, in fact, a check on Trump instigating political violence against his opponents in the meantime. The thought process being that once he's actually been impeached, there are no more sanctions to restrain him from going down this path: a path he's indicated a preference for on a number of occasions. For these reasons, the odds of impeachment are negligible, as close to 0 as possible, but not 0.

Nixon too was almost impeached, but he resigned before that the procedure started. Data show me that in the US impeachment for president has never resolved in a dismission and only few times in history it has been used. \n- Impeachment is a hard procedure. It is possible to impeach someone for \u201ctreason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanours\u201d. The last one is the vaguest of the three, so it can be interpreted quite liberally, in a restrictive or extensive way. In this case, it\u2019s used also to accuse Trump of \u201cobstructing justice, accepting what\u2019s known as emoluments, sowing racial discord and undermining the federal judiciary\u201d.\n- Usually, is the reason to which the Representatives bring into play, because it\u2019s easier to manipulate. However, the entire impeachment procedure is long and complex.\n- To be emanated by the House of Representatives, the impeachment article needs to take the simple majority (218 out of 435). Today, Democrats control only 193 seats (indeed, in both the House of R. and the Senate Republicans have the majority). \n- To obtain enough votes the Democrats should find allies between the Republicans, in particular the ones that disagree with the president governance. However, even among them, only very few exceptions want to implement the impeachment procedure.\n- Talking about the reason of the impeachment, the possible charges are: Trump personal returns from its policies (tax, health care education, immigration), abuse of power in an effort \u201cto punish companies associated with news outlets that have reported critically on him, including CNN and The Washington Post.\u201d, Trump collusion with Russia (Russiagate). However, they are all difficult to demonstrate.\n- Moreover, the special counsel R. Muller is overseeing the criminal investigation into Russia interference in 2016 campaign, but a couple of weeks ago from its report emerged that there is no evidence of collusion (even if this didn\u2019t clear him of the charges). Investigations continues, but the idea of the impeachments is getting away.\n- More than half of Trump presidency is already passed, and the elections will take place in 2020. Also, the impeachment procedure is long and complex. Therefore, It\u2019s not worthy for the Democrats to impeach Trump now because they could more easily prepare the electoral campaign.\n- Impeachment could be even counter-productive for the Democrats, because they could be depicted as those who wanted to get rid of Trump through impeachment because unable to compete properly during the next election. Also, they can be seen as the ones who has been dismissed \u201cbecause he was doing well\u201d. \n*Nevertheless, impeachment could be a (risky) strategy for Democrats if applied enough quick (before the end of 2019), because during the procedure Trump might lose a huge part of its consensus, to the benefit of the Democrats. https://www.tpi.it/2017/05/18/come-funziona-impeachment-stati-uniti/\nhttps://www.agi.it/estero/usa_camera_indaga_trump_valuteremo_impeachment-5085080/news/2019-03-03/\nhttps://www.ilfoglio.it/esteri/2019/03/25/news/no-collusion-cosi-il-rapporto-mueller-e-gia-diventato-uno-slogan-per-la-campagna-di-trump-245144/\n"], [64178, "2019-04-09T15:09:52Z", [0.0], ""], [11699, "2019-04-09T15:08:57Z", [0.12], ""], [31410, "2019-04-09T13:51:22Z", [0.15], ""], [67413, "2019-04-09T13:14:36Z", [0.09], "This is a case of presidential impeachment, which I will seperate from federal officials being impeached. Two president have been impeached (Clinton, Andrew Johnson), and Nixon was close but resigned before it happened. (I'm still counting it because, as I understand it, it was the threat of impeachment that made Nixon resign). The option to impeach have existed since the 1787 constitutional convention (i.e always). So, 3 of 45 presidents have been impeached, which gives 6.25% probability as my base rate.  Now to the specifics of  Donald Trump's presidency.  Arguments for a higher actual probability: \nBecause impeachment is actively being discussed, the actual probability should be higher than the base rate. (strong argument IMO).\nThe Democrats have the necessary majority to start the impeachments process in the House of Representatives.\nThe full  200-something page\"Muller report\" have not been published. Only a 4-page summary have been released. Incriminating details might come along if it evetually gets published.  Arguments for a lower actual probability:\nGoogle trends show a decreasing search activity for \"Impeachment & Trump\" [1].\nLeading Democrat figures are reportedly less inclined towards impachment according to this news article [2].\nThe american public is not really sure what to think about the \"Muller investigation\"  [3]. This is doubly important because Democrats Nancy Pelosi emphasized bi-partisan support for Trump impeachment, which 538 suggest there isn't at this point.

An article of impeachment against a President implies that he has committed a \"high crime\" or misdemeanours. However, this procedure is very demanding, difficult and rare, proven by history. Only two American presidents have been confronted to an article of impeachment from the U.S House of Representatives: Johnson and Clinton.  Donal Trump is highly criticized, mistrusted and unpopular among the opposition. Technically, an article of impeachment could relatively easily reach the majority (51%) within the House of Representatives. However, the Senat plays the important role, with providing the super majority (67%). Today, the Republicans have the majority of the Senat, but if there is an internal division regarding Trump\u2019s politics, it is unlikely that the Republicans remove an elected official of their party.   If the U.S House of Representatives was to pass an article of impeachment against President Trump, it would be expected from them to be sure regarding their accusation of high crime or misdemeanours, in order to succeed the impeachment. Yet, most of the willingness to impeach Trump lies on hate and disagreement. There are indeed some accusations against Trump, but they concern the pre-presidency period, which does not fit in the requirements for impeachment. Regarding the \u201cRussia gate\u201d, Mueller\u2019s report has not been able to show collusion between Trump and Moscow in the Presidential elections of 2016. In that sense, I find unlikely that the Democrats will pass an article of impeachment against President Trump before 1 October 2019, as there is no clear accusation to support.  Nevertheless, Trump\u2019s presidency is a hot topic, leading to a certain level of uncertainty. If there is no clear proof for accusation, doors remain open for other cases of misdemeanours and crimes e.g the possibility of obstruction of justice.  https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-46131046/democrats-and-trump-what-does-it-take-to-impeach-a-president\nhttp://fortune.com/2018/11/07/will-democrats-impeach-trump/\nhttps://www.lesechos.fr/monde/etats-unis/trump-le-procureur-special-ne-recommande-pas-de-mises-en-accusation-1003018"], [4707, "2019-04-07T05:19:51Z", [0.1], ""], [61260, "2019-04-06T23:59:44Z", [0.05], "the house realizes that there is no point impeaching trump so long he  enjoys 80+% support from his GOP base.

It is based upon the system of checks and balances that ensures the separation of powers. Congress may dismiss officers before their term of office expires. According to Article 2(4), the reasons for initiating the procedure may be the following: high treason, bribery or other serious crimes and misconduct. The question at hand, explicitly limits itself to the likelihood of an impeachment article against Trump passed by the House of Representatives, which is unlike the Senate lead by the Democrats at this point in time. Thus, a simple majority against Republican Trump would be possible, even though most likely unsuccessful due to the majority of the Republicans in the Senate.  Base-rate for the forecast at hand is the history of impeachment procedures in the US history. Only two presidents, Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1998 were impeached by the House of Repr\u00e4sentatives (Nixon resigned before a corresponding vote could be hold). Given the 45 presidents (Cleveland counted twice) the impeachment quote is only 4,4%.  However, the forecast at hand adds further 5.6% on this base rate due to the high degree of uncertainty aligned with the presidency of Trump, the majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives, as well as the not yet completely enclosed political consequences of the report of FBI special investigator M\u00fcller. Mueller investigated whether there had been secret agreements between Trump's campaign and Moscow and whether Trump had obstructed justice by dismissing FBI chief James Comey in May 2017. Mueller\u2019s report comes to the conclusion that there had been no secret agreements. Not so clear are Mueller's findings on the second point, whether Trump had obstructed the judiciary. Neither does the report find him guilty, nor non-guilty. Instead, Mueller would have listed evidences for both points, based upon which Attorney General Barr decided not press charges against Trump. So far, Congress has only seen a summary of the report and Democrats are pushing for a soon hearing. Thus, even though unlikely a further escalation is cannot be excluded completely.

Will Trump be brought be brought before the House? \nThe democrats have hinted at starting an impeachment process.  But threats to do so are not uncommon. In addition to Trump, the two presidents preceding (Obama and Bush) also endured suggestions they should be impeached: indicating a threat to impeach does not amount to any actual action. This is a consideration of this forecast. Nevertheless, with control of the house, impeachment is definitely possible \u2014 as long as they can establish high crimes and misdemeanours. But this may prove difficult. While surrounded by scandal, many of the activities which may qualify as such occurred before the term of Trump's presidency. Last year, 5 separate democrats brought forth articles of impeachments to the judicial committee. These have not yet been pursued, with the chair of the judiciary committee \u2018taking a \u2018\u2019wait and see\u2019\u2019 approach to the idea of impeachment\u2019 (The Conversation, 31 Jan 2019). It seems the committee had been waiting for more concrete evidence of high crimes and misdemeanours \u2014 perhaps anticipating damaging information to emerge out of the Mueller report. We know now that a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia was not established, nor did he obstruct justice (though not totally exonerated, mind you). With the big opportunity for establishing grounds to move forward with the impeachment process not delivering, it seems highly unlikely that the democrats will unveil new information that will prove misdemeanours and high crimes. In addition, the very low likelihood of the impeachment passing with a high majority in the Senate (given it is controlled by republicans and it has never happened before) means that the potential crime which permit the process would have to be so abhorrent, and proven beyond reasonable doubt, for Democrats to feel confident that the process will bring about Trump\u2019s removal (if that is their goal).  All of this suggests that an article of impeachment is unlikely to be brought to the House of Representatives before October 1. It is forecasted at 5% -- close to the base rate of previously impeached presidents.

Firstly, looking at the historical trend we can see as the USA have never had a president impeached before (it was started 2 times (Clinton and Johnson presidency but it has never succeeded, while Nixon resigned before the procedure was activated). True, this is a strongly peculiar presidency, but nevertheless there are no elements which bring to this scenario. Indeed, accusations of impeachment can be addressed only under strict conditions which are: treason, bribery or high crimes and misdemeanours. \nThe only chance for the democrats to address such a serious accusation (for was in relation to Trump\u2019s presumed allegation with Russia (archenemy of the USA and therefore something that would have been seen as unacceptable). However, a couple of days ago the publication of Muller\u2019s report has lower the chance of playing this card to the bottom. Perhaps, is not the very end of the Russiagate, but (Miller did not say that the investigation is finished) a turning point in the investigations now quite unlikely. \nFurthermore, with more than half term already passed, Trump\u2019s impeachment is not anymore such relevant for the Democrats, neither is convenient. They have the possibility to democratically win at the next 2020 elections and doing so they would avoid the argument \u201cThey overthrew him because it was doing the right thing\u201d. An idea that might be easily \u201csold\u201d to many Trump's supporters. Contrariwise, Democrats are now more focused on the internal battle for who will be the next leader running in the elections.  That said I leave a 10 % chance considering Trump\u2019s gloomy and uncertain past which may lead to new uninspected and astonishing revelations. After all, Trump has still 17 ongoing investigations regarding his relationship with Russia and also one for a possible case of corruption of a Woman before the elections.

If this will happen, a subsequent Senate inquriy have to follow. Two more specifications are to be added to this.\nFirst, an article of impeachment can arise only from suspected presdential acts of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. These acts, in Trump's case, can be linked to the 17 ongoing investigations about the collusion with Russia in the 2016's elections (https://www.wired.com/story/mueller-investigation-trump-russia-complete-guide/), to the suspected payment of hush money to women before the elections, and the suspected abuse of power underlined in the suggested literature in the question. Avoiding technicalities, investigations leading to a presidential impeachment have to be especially accurate - so, long! - and the recent findings (e.g. Mueller report) seems to avoid the impeachment for Trump.\nSecond, we're rapidly running towards the 2020's elections. I don't want to suggest that, with the appropriate reasons, an impeachment is useless right before the president ceases to have its presidency anyway, but given the historical difficulty in concluding an impeachment procedure - as most knows, the impeachment in the US never happened, and the only impeachment that could have actually worked ended with Nixon's resignation - I would say that the House of Representatives don't have many incentives in igniting an impeachment procedure. From a political point of view, keeping Trump under investigation and continuing the efforts and oppositions can be much more rewarding. \nNevertheless, as stated at the beginning, the House of Representatives can still decide to pass an article of impeachment before October, transforming the last month of the presidency in an endless trial/political campaign that aims at collecting votes in the incoming elections.

Moreover, In its history the USA has never passed an impeachment procedure. Twice they started one, and it failed (Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson). In the case of Nixon, he resigned before proceedings were started. Both Bush jr. and Barack Obama, were threatened with impeachment by members of congress as well (for Iraq, and Benghazi respectively), however nothing materialized. This results in an extremely low base rate of Impeachments in the US: 0% succesful impeachments in the US Despite this there are Indications that this will change with Donald Trump. Keeping in mind the offenses that could lead to impeachment, the Russian collusion allegations are the main threat to the continuation of Trump as the US President The Mueller report found no evidence of collusion (despite not clearing him of the charges, continuing investigations in several companies and accounts, and the full report (still) not being available) which means that the most clear path to impeachment has hit a roadblock. This has resulted in several democrats stating that Impeachment is right now not the right move anymore. I find it likely that once the full Mueller report is released, the hopes of impeachment will be given up, and that the US will accept the fact that they would have to ride out the rest of the Trump presidency.  Breakthroughs in the investigations on the new companies will have me alter this forecast, but currently it seems highly unlikely.  https://www.thoughtco.com/presidents-who-were-impeached-3368130\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/mueller-report-summary-reaction/index.html\nhttps://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/"], [1333, "2019-03-26T18:48:19Z", [0.02], ""], [67418, "2019-03-26T18:47:36Z", [0.05], "The current context of American politics shows a certain polarization of the bipartisan divide. So it is often mentioned Impeachment vis-\u00e0-vis Trump. Context of Impeachment:\nImpeachment is the fact that an American president \u201cshall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors \u201c(http://fortune.com/2018/11/07/will-democrats-impeach-trump/). For Trump, it should be certain that he committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" that would warrant an attempt to remove him from office.\nHistory of Impeachment:\nTechnically, there has never been a successful US President's Impeachment. \nHistorically, the United States House of Representatives has voted indictment only seventeen times, out of just over sixty cases; only three procedures concerned presidents. The two proceedings passed the House of Representatives were: Andrew Johnson (for firing his secretary of war) in 1868 and Bill Clinton (for obstruction of justice) in 1998. Nevertheless, the Senate, having the majority of supporters of their camps each time, saved them (indeed it takes 2/3 of the Senate, or 67 senators for the conviction). Nixon, most likely to remove his post, resigned himself in 1974, when it became clear he would be impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate.\nTo pass an Impeachement article, you need the majority vote of the House.\nIt should be noted that on all Impeachment articles, the procedure for a president is relatively very rare (much less rare for judges). The two suspicions of Trump's criminal acts resulting in the possibility of being impeached:\nCollusion between Trump and Russia (the most \u00ab\u00a0pushing Trump to the exit\u00a0\u00bb): Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, could choose to submit a written report to Congress alleging misdeeds by Trump ( http://fortune.com/2018/11/07/will-democrats-impeach-trump/)\nTrump's involvement in a criminal act: for example, the payment of hush money to two women before the 2016 election, as Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, alleged.  Current US Congress Context:\nCurrent Senate Composition: 53 Republicans (Majority) out of 100 Senators\nComposition of the House of Representatives: 235 Democrats vs 199 Republicans\nNote also the next US election on November 3, 2020 Forecast:\nIn my opinion, it seems highly improbable to me that an Impeachment move goes to House in the context of today. Indeed, the most damaging case for Trump, the collusion with Russia, finally came to an end. On March 24, 2019, Justice Minister William Barr presented the findings of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on this case. The latter reports that the Special Prosecutor's investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 campaign have not shown that \"the Trump campaign team or anyone associated with it has agreed or coordinated with Russia in his efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. \" In addition, the scope of the Mueller investigation is not to be taken lightly: \"The special prosecutor employed 19 lawyers assisted by a team of 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants; with 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 13 requests for evidence to foreign governments and about 500 witnesses interviewed \"according to the Minister of Justice.\nIn a second step, the other point examined by the report, namely a possible obstruction of justice by Donald Trump, \"does not conclude that the president has committed a crime, but does not exonerate him\" . The Minister of Justice, he said that the investigation did not mention any offense likely to lead to prosecution on this point.\nAs for the other possibility of a criminal offense (hush money during the campaign), it certainly seems difficult to determine the veracity of that. Michael Cohen made that allegation while pleading guilty on Aug. 21 to tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and making illegal campaign contributions.\nIt should also be noted that before the resolution of the Russian file, in full uncertainty about the collusion with Russia, in the 115th Congress, two House votes on impeachment resolution, were defeated 364-58 in December 2017 and 355-66 in January 2018. This shows a heavy defeat of the small fraction of democrats wanting impeachment of Trump, and therefore of the democrats' split on this subject. The launch of a serious effort towards impeachment is far from certaine due to the fact that the question of impeachment may lead to fissures within the party. Now that the report concludes that there was no collusion and that Trump is not charged anywhere for criminal offenses, an Impeachment that passes the House seems concretely impossible. According to the NY Times, this conclusion of the case lifts \"the darkest and most threatening cloud that hovered over the presidency\" and \"remove the question of President Trump's removal from office\", despite the Democrats' promise advance on other investigations.\nIt should also be noted that the Senate will not vote Impeachment if it is ultimately formulated, and a presidential election is close, so it is good to avoid fragmenting before.\nDespite the demand of US citizens to dismiss Trump, because of disagreements with his policy, an Impeachment measure is not an option. Indeed, it is not the dismantling of environmental protections, the skepticism about Climate Change or the measures taken regarding immigration, that are actions that can legitimize an Impeachment measure. No matter what one thinks of Trump's policy, it is not criminal, because it is legal, and therefore an Impeachment is not a viable and possible remedy."], [705, "2019-03-26T18:07:30Z", [0.01], ""], [68146, "2019-03-26T17:30:02Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2019-03-26T15:57:44Z", [0.01], ""], [20044, "2019-03-26T15:10:41Z", [0.09], ""], [15196, "2019-03-26T13:01:46Z", [0.0], ""], [62737, "2019-03-26T12:22:45Z", [0.16], "With what's currently known about the Mueller report, I'm dropping it to 16%."], [68140, "2019-03-26T12:18:12Z", [0.08], "House Speaker Pelosli has stated that this is not her strategy.

The speaker and other party leaders believe that, barring a startling new revelation of wrongdoing, Democrats are better off trying to beat Mr. Trump at the polls in 2020 than going down the impeachment path. A failed attempt to impeach Mr. Trump and remove him from office, they fear, would only embolden the president\u2019s staunchest supporters and could improve his odds of re-election. Instead, Democratic leaders have poured their energy into a growing list of investigations \u2014 into Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, potential foreign financial leverage over his businesses or administration, and whether Mr. Trump or those around him obstructed justice, abused power or engaged in otherwise corrupt acts, among other topics. At least two wild cards remain: federal prosecutors in New York who are scrutinizing Mr. Trump\u2019s business and inaugural committee, and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who is investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and whether the president obstructed justice. Mr. Mueller is believed to be nearing the end of his investigation.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  There is also the time element in this question; there's barely more than 6 months before this question closes."], [1646, "2019-03-12T16:46:55Z", [0.05], ""], [1646, "2019-03-12T16:46:43Z", [0.1], ""], [67899, "2019-03-12T16:19:43Z", [0.07], "widely accepted condemning findings in Mueller investigation not likely.

It is difficult to assess a likelihood on this going one way or another, but it is worth noting that if Mueller issues a suggestion for indictment this information will legally have to become public anyways. Thus, given 1a is true & Mueller recommends a Trump indictment as a result the outcome in this question is likely the same.\nOn point 2...\n - Given the recent indictment of other Trump campaign personnel (Lost of lying to federal agents, a couple counts of obstruction, failure to report serving as a foreign agent, campaign finance violations, etc...) & the statements made by Michael Cohen (explicitly stating that Trump committed many similar violations of the law), I would say this is certainly plausible if not likely at this point.\nOn point 3...\n - Even if placing the given odds above at 50/50 for case 1 & 2 respectively would place 75% odds on Trump being implicated in a Mueller report.

Thus giving a probability of either one or the other occurring as 91%.\n - As far as the HoR filing articles of impeachment if either were to occur, I would say all but guaranteed (> 99%)  and given the majority of the Dem. control similar odds on it passing. However what would be the odds of it occurring prior to January 1st? That's the important bit. I would say there are the following likely periods that democratic leadership would look to act...\n a) Prior to the peak of the Republican Primary campaign period to ensure that such a move at least promoted Republicans to contest Trump as the R. 2020 candidate (~6-months prior to the first caucus (Iowa in February 2020), thus around August 2019)\n b) Immediately following (+ < 1 month) release of the Mueller report\n c) Near the RNC (Late August 2020)\n d) During the 2020 General Election\nI would personally posit odds of [15%, 75%, 5%, 5%] respectively (Only real precedent to go off here would be the Nixon & Clinton impeachment articles, one of which was immediately following the special investigation report (Clinton) and one which preceded it (Nixon)).

Base rate = 3/151 = 2% Under Pelosi's leadership, the House will only pass an article of impeachment if it thinks the circumstances of that impeachment will also have enough support in the senate to remove the president from office.  The odds for this bipartisan response are low and hinge on Mueller finding a smoking gun or any of the other ongoing investigations digging up something big.  The reasoning is a failed impeachment attempt would be damaging to the democratic party and could strengthen Trumps support in the next election (similar to what happened with Clinton).  Therefore, the far better strategy for dems than swinging for the fences and going for an impeachment is to be patient, wait and see what Mueller and others find out, and continue to let ongoing investigations drum up negative news about Trump that could potentially weaken support in the next election.   However, while historical odds are low for a presidential impeachment, I believe they are elevated in this circumstance.  This is supported by the President's misbehavior, the numerous ongoing investigations, guilty pleas, and evidence of smaller crimes.  Therefore, I increase the base rate by 50% to account for the higher risk in this scenario.   Reduction for time passed:  The house will have to pass an article of impeachment in the next 6 months.  Therefore, I reduce the probability by 6/12. 2% base rate increased by 50% for higher risk reduced by 50%  for passage of time = 2% chance Overall, I think the chances are low.  Mueller and others need to find something big to have bipartisan support for impeachment and removal.  Dems can afford to wait and let the damaging information continue to weaken support for the next election.

It is true that about 40 percent of the population will oppose Trump's impeachment no matter what.  However, support for his impeachment, which is now at about 45 percent, would have to rise to 55 to 60 percent for the house to vote for impeachment.  I think the odds of this happening are about even.  Even so, it does not change what I wrote below.   Such a high number would be a condition precedent, not sufficient condition, for passing articles of impeachment.   Nevertheless, I think impeachment would be fairly certain with more than 60 percent support because it would resolve Nancy Pelosi's concerns.  Nancy Pelosi is clearly worried that passing an article of impeachment without strong public support could severely backfire--perhaps guaranteeing Trump's reelection.  For that reason, there  would have to be strong bipartisan public support,, and impeachment would have to be viewed as an act that was not merely a futile attempt to embarrass the president.  The key is the nature and extent of evidence of wrongdoing  Muller and the house investigation uncover and make public.  Such evidence  would have to be sufficient that a number of Republican senators  would vote for impeachment.  There are a few who would consider it such as Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.  However, I think Pelosi will want at at the very least a senate majority  before allowing  articles to go forward, and that would require two more Republican votes.  I am not sure she could get them. I suspect Muller and the house investigation will find evidence sufficient for the public to support impeachment since what is publicly known right now suggests Trump is a crook  (e.g., Trump University, Cohen's testimony regarding fraud, and his property management history), and the campaign did collude with the Russians (e.g., Trump Jr's, Kushner's and Flynn's contacts with Russians -- and repeatedly lying about them -- during the campaign, and Campaign Manger Manifort's sharing of confidential polling data with the Russians to name just a few).    Any evidence in support of impeachment will excite the left wing of the Democratic Party but will also excite the right wing of the Republican Party just as much.  Pelosi will keep the left wing of the party  in check by reminding them that the impeachment of President Clinton cost the Republicans in the following election because the public did not feel impeachment was justified by Clinton's wrongdoing.  The Republicans impeached Clinton to satisfy their base, and it cost them.  She will not make the same mistake.  Moreover, the Republicans will argue the voters should decide these issues, and this argument will gain more acceptance as the 2020 election approaches. To balance the competing factors, I think the strong evidence of wrongdoing and desire of the left for impeachment will be outweighed by the futility of the act (in that the Republican Senate will never vote to impeach), the risk of backlash in the 2020 election and the desire of the voters to  decide.    However, there is also a good chance that so much evidence of serious wrongdoing, including Russian collusion, could be made public that the house will vote for articles of impeachment, and a number of purple state Republicans would vote for it --  not enough for impeachment-- or have their reelection chances diminished."], [37520, "2019-03-04T04:11:14Z", [0.1], "From the Democrats' point of view, it's probably  better to go up against Trump in 2020 than an alternative.

Is impeachment likely?\n2. will it be before 1 October 2019? Is impeachment likely?\nI think it is probable that the democratic house would pass an article of impeachment against Trump. Although few US presidents have ever been impeached and the base rate for impeachment is therefore low, I think the situation today allows for it. \nTrump is a controversial president and the tension between the parties is high. There are legal issues and accusations against Trump and his people. Many people criminalize Trump and the left-leaning media, as well as the politicians, reinforce this message constantly. This general opinion is making it inevitable for the democratic party to do something of consequence. Impeachment is the implied consequence for suspectedly crooked presidents. \nMrs Pelosi and other Democrats have said that they want to build their actions on the results of the Mueller investigation. Justly so. However, creating a clear picture of Trump's machinations is most certainly hard. Potential hard crimes, in this case, are difficult to prove. I can hardly imagine the final Mueller report being a clear-cut case for impeachment. Probably the Mueller report will be legalistic, complex and judicially somewhat ambivalent. Nevertheless, I think there is enough political pressure to pass an article of impeachment in the house, should the Mueller report confirm some misdeeds. I think the pressure to impeach would win, even when the report is oblique and even if it is clear that the article would never pass in the Senate.  Will it happen before 1 October 2019?\n In order for the article of impeachment to pass before 1 October 2019, Mueller needs to finish his report before this date and the house needs to agree on the content of the article. \nOn average, special counsel investigations take 904 days. Mueller was appointed 643 days ago. If Mueller finishes his report on 1 October, he will have taken 866 days for his investigation (less than the average). I think the case is big and complex enough to warrant an average investigation period.\nDrafting and agreeing on the articles of impeachment and all the processes surrounding the passing of an article of impeachment also takes time. Looking at the time it takes for a bill to pass into law as a reference, I found an average of 263 days (https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-to-pass-a-bill-in-the-US). The time needed to pass a bill in parliament is certainly less. However, even if it takes half the average time it takes for a bill to pass into law (about 130 days), we are talking about months, not days.\nWith 223 days to go until 1 October, it seems very unlikely the article will pass before October 1."], [67529, "2019-02-20T18:14:20Z", [0.2], "They will wait for the election"], [14595, "2019-02-20T17:58:18Z", [0.25], "Big difference between \"table\" and \"pass\", notably in this time frame.

After being rebuffed by the U.S. Congress in his request for $5.7 billion to help build the wall that was a signature 2016 campaign promise, Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers given to the president under a 1976 law. The move, according to the White House, enables Trump to bypass lawmakers and redirect money already appropriated by Congress for other purposes and use it for wall construction. Peter Shane, a professor at Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law, said challenges to the emergency declaration could end up as a replay of the legal battle against Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority nations. The Supreme Court last year upheld the travel ban after lower courts had ruled against Trump, with the justices giving the president deference on immigration and national security issues (Para. 1-3).

Presidential Impeachment: The Legal Standard and Procedure\nhttps://litigation.findlaw.com/legal-system/presidential-impeachment-the-legal-standard-and-procedure.html The involuntary removal of a sitting President of the United States has never occurred in our history. The only legal way such can be accomplished is by the impeachment process. This article discusses the legal standard to be properly applied by members of the U.S. House of Representatives when voting for or against Articles of Impeachment, and members of the U.S. Senate when voting whether to convict and remove from office a President of the U.S., as well as the procedure to be followed. Article I \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution gives the House of Representatives the sole power to impeach (make formal charges against) and Article I \u00a7 3 gives the Senate the sole power to try impeachments. Article II \u00a7 4 of the Constitution provides as follows: \"The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\nThus, the operative legal standard to apply to an impeachment of a sitting President is \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\" There is substantial difference of opinion over the interpretation of these words. There are essentially four schools of thought concerning the meaning of these words, although there are innumerable subsets within those four categories. Congressional Interpretation The first general school of thought is that the standard enunciated by the Constitution is subject entirely to whatever interpretation Congress collectively wishes to make: \"What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two-thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office...\" Congressman Gerald Ford, 116 Cong. Rec. H.3113-3114 (April 15, 1970). This view has been rejected by most legal scholars because it would have the effect of having the President serve at the pleasure of Congress. However there are some, particularly in Congress, who hold this opinion. An Indictable Crime The second view is that the Constitutional standard makes it necessary for a President to have committed an indictable crime in order to be subject to impeachment and removal from office. This view was adopted by many Republicans during the impeachment investigation of President Richard M. Nixon. The proponents of this view point to the tone of the language of Article II \u00a7 4 itself, which seems to be speaking in criminal law terms. There are other places in the Constitution which seem to support this interpretation, as well. For example, Article III \u00a7 2 (3) provides that \"the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury.\" Clearly the implication of this sentence from the Constitution is that impeachment is being treated as a criminal offense, ergo, impeachment requires a criminal offense to have been committed. Article II \u00a7 2 (1) authorizes the President to grant pardons \"for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\" This sentence implies that the Framers must have thought impeachment, and the acts which would support impeachment, to be criminal in nature. In the past, England had used impeachment of the King's ministers as a means of controlling policy (Parliament could not get rid of the King, but could get rid of his ministers who carried out acts Parliament believed to be against the best interest of the country). However, in English impeachments, once convicted that person was not only removed from office but was also punished (usually by execution). Misdemeanor The third approach is that an indictable crime is not required to impeach and remove a President. The proponents of this view focus on the word \"misdemeanor\" which did not have a specific criminal connotation to it at the time the Constitution was ratified. This interpretation is somewhat belied by details of the debate the Framers had in arriving at the specific language to be used for the impeachment standard. Initially the standard was to be \"malpractice or neglect of duty.\" This was removed and replaced with \"treason, bribery, or corruption.\" The word \"corruption\" was then eliminated. On the floor during debate the suggestion was made to add the term \"maladministration.\" This was rejected as being too vague and the phrase \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" was adopted in its place. There are many legal scholars who believe this lesser standard is the correct one, however. Relating to the President's Official Duties The fourth view is that an indictable crime is not required, but that the impeachable act or acts done by the President must in some way relate to his official duties. The bad act may or may not be a crime but it would be more serious than simply \"maladministration.\" This view is buttressed in part by an analysis of the entire phrase \"high crimes or misdemeanors\" which seems to be a term of art speaking to a political connection for the bad act or acts. In order to impeach it would not be necessary for the act to be a crime, but not all crimes would be impeachable offenses. Some hold the opinion that Congress could pass laws by declaring what constitutes \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" which would, in effect, be a list of impeachable offenses. That has never happened. (Query: If Congress passed such a code of impeachable offenses, could that be applied retroactively, much as a definition, to a sitting President? Would such an application be viewed as an ex post facto law? Also, would such a statue be an attempt to amend the Constitution, without following the amendment procedure?) Ellis, C., M. (1867).

A few notable Democratic Party leaders who have called for the Presidents impeachment include, but are not limited to: Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer. With control of the U.S. House of Representatives having a democratic majority, there is a chance that an article of impeachment could presumably be passed, however, I think this is more of a propaganda piece for the Democratic leaders to rally their base and garner support for upcoming elections. In the hypothetical situation that an article of impeachment is passed against President Trump, a super majority is needed in the U.S. Senate in order to convict a federal official. Now, lets entertain the thought that the Republican majority in the senate sides with the House Democrats and passes the articles of impeachment; President Trump is impeached and his successor would be none other that Vice President Pence. In this hypothetical situation, President Trump would seem like the clear choice when given the alternative of a Pence Presidency rather than a Trump. This is not to say that the House won't try their luck and pass an article of impeachment for the sole purpose of rallying their base, but the likelihood of the House actually passing articles of impeachment are very low.  I don't think that democrats want to travel down this rabbit hole, but they could impeach him, but I don't think the Senate will convict him.

"], [1056, "2019-01-29T15:50:40Z", [0.7], "We may be approaching a convergence of forces that, almost by accident, make it easy to impeach - and actually remove - Trump. The first factor is Trump's surrender on the wall. There are still people who stick to the \"Trump is playing 3-dimensional chess\" model, but it seems to me that opinion has always been an example of overthinking. Ann Coulter is the best example of a pro-Trump pundit who has given up on him. There are others. They appear to be a minority at the moment, and according to USA Today, polls indicate that Trump's base is still solid: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/28/shutdown-donald-trumps-base-cave-poll/2701887002/ However, in the end, Trump has to deliver something on immigration; this is his signature issue. If he does not unequivocally \"win\" on immigration, his base may begin to change its mind about him. Trump's penchant for excuses, blame-shifting, and transparent exaggeration may not be indulged if he abandons his hard-line stance on border security. So I don't think the support reflected in current polls will hold if Trump gets no concessions on border security. The second factor is the institutional Republican Party, especially represented by the Republican caucus in the Senate. They never liked Trump anyway, and did everything they could to stop him until the very last minute, when they aligned with him because they had no choice. So far, they have been unable to defy Trump because he is a proven vote getter, standard bearer of the anti-progressives, and champion of the \"deplorables.\" So if you're a Republican candidate in a red state or a red district in a blue states -  you need him. Unless, of course, he has alienated his electoral base, in which case he is not an asset and may be a liability. Trump himself has identified the wall as his issue. He may be dumb enough to believe that he is idolized to such an extent that he can turn on a dime and completely reverse himself on the wall. He can't. So what it comes down to is that if Trump loses a significant portion of his voters, the Republican Party - which never wanted him as its leader - may be willing (and happy) to dump him. And then we would get President Pence, who the regular Republicans would be quite comfortable with, and was in fact selected to be Trump's Vice-President for exactly that reason. Third, Mueller's report is supposed to be coming out soon. I expect Mueller will have found nothing to indicate that the Russian collusion story has any substance. The report will, however, provide fodder for endless investigations by Congressional committees. There is a difference of opinion over whether impeachment is a political or criminal procedure, and people usually come down one way or the other depending upon whether they want the current president impeached. I think we will find that this year, majority opinion in Congress will be that just about anything \"rises to the level of impeachment.\" They will not need any actual prosecutable criminal offense, or something that can plausibly be identified as \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" to vote for articles of impeachment. It will be enough to impeach Trump because they consider him to be a bad person. The Democrats will be able to produce ample evidence that Trump is a bad person, and it is possible that by that time, there will be no one left willing to come to the defense of Donald Trump. Two things that may happen that would send matters in a different direction: 1) Trump allows another government shutdown after the current stopgap expires, declares an emergency, and builds the wall. 2) Mueller, or someone else, finds an actual legal violation by Trump, in which case public and political opinion generally agree that he should be removed from office. Note that in case #1 above, Trump's declaration of an emergency may itself trigger impeachment. In both cases, we wind up with President Pence."], [19340, "2019-01-29T15:04:43Z", [0.0], ""], [67138, "2019-01-29T10:55:41Z", [0.1], ""], [66929, "2019-01-29T06:24:14Z", [0.45], "I think it depends on how much evidence comes out and how Fox News will cover it.

Considering the glacial pace of these proceedings, Dems would be better off politically to just focus on finding a viable candidate to compete against Trump in 2020 than spend their time trying to impeach him given that a Republican controlled Senate is all but certain to acquit him, which would bolster Trump's credibility going into the elections. \n- http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/impeachments/nixon.htm\n- http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/impeachments/clinton.htm For this question to be resolved as \"Yes\", the House only has to get to step 5 below, which is doable within the specific end date. However, I think getting through the first 4 steps will be a political quagmire with the general election less then 2 years away. Modern Impeachment Procedure: - http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/impeachments/\n1) Impeachment resolutions made by members of the House of Representatives are turned over to the House Judiciary Committee which decides whether the resolution and its allegations of wrongdoing by the President merits a referral to the full House for a vote on launching a formal impeachment inquiry.\n2) The entire House of Representatives votes for or against a formal impeachment inquiry, needing only a simple majority (a single vote) for approval.\n3) If approved, the House Judiciary Committee conducts an investigation to determine (similar to a grand jury) if there is enough evidence to warrant articles of impeachment (indictments) against the President. The Committee then drafts articles of impeachment pertaining to specific charges supported by the evidence. The Committee votes on each article of impeachment, deciding whether to refer each article to the full House for a vote.\n4) If the House Judiciary Committee refers one or more articles of impeachment, the entire House of Representatives votes on whether the article(s) merit a trial in the Senate, needing only a simple majority for approval.\n5) If the full House approves at least one article of impeachment, the President is technically impeached and the matter is referred to the U.S. Senate. The House then appoints members of Congress to act as managers (prosecutors).\n6) The trial of the President is held in the Senate with the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court presiding. The President can be represented by anyone he chooses. He may appear personally or leave his defense in the hands of his lawyer.\n7) The entire Senate may conduct the trial or it or it may be delegated to a special committee which would report all the evidence to the full Senate.\n8) The actual trial is conducted in a courtroom-like proceeding including examination and cross-examination of witnesses. During questioning, Senators remain silent, directing all questions in writing to the Chief Justice.\n9) After hearing all of the evidence and closing arguments, the Senate deliberates behind closed doors then votes in open session on whether to convict or acquit the President. The vote to convict must be by a two thirds majority, or 67 Senators. If this occurs, the President is removed from office and is succeeded by the Vice President. The Senate's verdict is final and there is no right of appeal."], [691, "2019-01-20T13:17:35Z", [0.06], ""], [41869, "2019-01-20T12:41:57Z", [0.6], ""], [63914, "2019-01-20T12:14:12Z", [0.15], "That the Democrats will put together an article of impeachment, yes, especially if they can blindside DT into extending the shutdown so that its  hurts not just Fed employees but all the businesses depending on licences, reviews and permits (the IPO market already affected, as are exporters).

So far Trump's popularity has been remarkably stable (even with the recent dip) => 80% \n3) a belief among 20+ Trump-district Democrats that voting for impeachment in 2019 will help more than hurt their 2020 re-election efforts => **25% (from 50% based on the idea that most will prefer to fly below the radar on divisive issues in the lead-up to an election season.)\n4) belief among Democratic leadership it would help the party overall in the 2020 elections => 90% if all of the above is true, then this seems likely.\n5) Trump could resign (and get a pardon from Pence) prior to the impeachment vote being completed. => 50%\n**Those multiply out to around 3.5% **Without getting too in the weeds on an a I'll call the probability of B happening 1%.

There's not a lot of data points for impeachment, but it seems to me that if a president from one party gets impeached, then almost surely a president from the other party will be elected next time; which strongly motivates Senate Rs to not impeach. So the only way I see (1) happening is if Mueller probe finds something that seems very bad to lots of the public, including Rs. That's different than something simply being bad; it must also be relatively easy to understand. I am not keeping up with the investigation but the things I've heard (deals to build buildings in Moscow?) either don't seem THAT bad, or if they are bad, it's not so easy to understand why. According to 538 [1] the latest reveals, whatever they are, haven't swung public opinion much. Moreover, I conjecture that to get together enough evidence of worse things takes longer; i.e. if I did a really bad thing X, there are other things A,B,C,... which are not as bad as X, and which I can claim I did instead of X, consistently with small amounts of evidence. E.g. you find some evidence E and accuse me of X, and I say I did A instead. To tell A from X you have to gather more evidence E', but then I say I did B; etc. So if Mueller was going to come out with something seriously bad that he knew might lead to impeachment, he would try to make it ironclad. That lowers the chances even further; there has to exist something really bad; Mueller needs to find it; and he needs to get it together quickly. Let's call it a 10% chance. For (2), assume there do not surface reasons to impeach that convince a large swath of the public. What is the political calculus? In that case I feel like Rs and independents would disapprove of efforts to impeach. It would be maybe a symbolic gesture from Ds, but it would hurt them with independents, which they need. You could argue that by NOT impeaching, Ds would alienate their own base, perhaps lowering turnout; but it seems easier to convince D base of decision not to impeach --- \"Senate Rs wouldn't let it happen\" --- than it would be to convice Rs + Is of decision to impeach. Moreover, if Ds were going to impeach for some symbolic purpose, it would make more sense to do it closer to the 2020 election, making Oct 2019 too soon. So I want to call this possibility 10% as well. Total: 20%.

It is very risky politically for them since nothing will fire up Trump's base in 2020 like the Washington Establishment out to get their President ... impeachment of Trump won't change their minds about him.  With a unified GOP led senate nothing would come of it so for Nancy Pelosi the risks outweigh the benefits ... at least for the moment.

Here's the headline and subheadline: \"The Inevitability of Impeachment\nEven Republicans may be deciding that the president has become too great a burden to their party or too great a danger to the country.\" Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/opinion/trump-impeachment-resign-drew.html She doesn't give a time frame, so she may not mean that the Articles of Impeachment will be passed this year, but it's difficult (for me, anyway) to imagine an impeachment vote taking place during primary season 2020. So it's 2019 or not at all. She may of course be wrong, but since she is so highly regarded her opinion is worth considering. It seems to me the key to her opinion is when she writes: \"I don\u2019t share the conventional view that if Mr. Trump is impeached by the House, the Republican-dominated Senate would never muster the necessary 67 votes to convict him... It always seemed to me that Mr. Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency was unsustainable and that key Republicans would eventually decide that he had become too great a burden to the party or too great a danger to the country. That time may have arrived. In the end the Republicans will opt for their own political survival... Facing an assortment of unpalatable possibilities, including being indicted after he leaves office, Mr. Trump will be looking for a way out... Mr. Trump could well exhibit a similar instinct for self-preservation... like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump will want future legal protection. While Mr. Trump\u2019s case is more complex than Mr. Nixon\u2019s, the evident dangers of keeping an out-of-control president in office might well impel politicians in both parties, not without controversy, to want to make a deal to get him out of there.\" The flaw in this scenario is the anticipation of the Republicans in the Senate behaving in 2019 or 2020 the way they behaved in 1974. Drew seems to think that Trump is a one-off phenomenon, rather than just one example of how drastically the political climate in the U.S. has changed overall in the past twenty or so years. Trump's presidency may be turbulent, but for the Republicans, a Democratic ascendancy would be no less turbulent, and all items on the Republican agenda would be compromised, perhaps for good.  And to suggest that Republicans would abandon Trump, and hand a victory to the Democrats, over the Khashoggi murder, the Syria pullout, the Mattis resignation, or all three together is delusional.

Assuming the Mueller report does not come out with anything too damnig, it probably won\u2019t be worth it for many House democrats. It risks alienating voters in the middle and enraging Trump supporters (leading to stronger turnout in 2020). The repercussions could mean that Democrats lose further ground in key battlegrounds like the rust belt, rural America, the South, which I don\u2019t think they want to do.  A more progressive and constructive strategy for Democrats would be to show what they stand for, not what they stand against. To be proactive rather than reactive. To fight for immigration reform and healthcare and other causes that can help them win middle and lower class votes. An attempt at impeachment would take much time and energy that would distract from policy making and from building the platform of the Democratic party for 2020. Granted, in politics one can win many votes by simply bashing the other side. There will be Democrats who can build public profiles and popularity by pushing for impeachment. But I am guessing that on the whole, impeachment will be a step too far for many/most Democrats in the House. They can criticize Trump without impeaching him.  A key variable will be the Mueller report. Importantly, it won\u2019t matter so much what\u2019s in it as how it is perceived. In today\u2019s age of tribal epistemology, it is less likely that incriminating eviddence will be seen as incriminating by those of the populace who are predisposed to support Trump.

But the investigative hard-chargers do not appear to be prevailing in shaping the Democrats\u2019 early 2019 agenda. That is because other Democrats - including key committee leaders - want to focus on immigration, rising student loan debt, high-cost prescription drugs and the federal response to hurricane disasters, especially in Puerto Rico.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-investigations/senior-house-democrats-tap-brakes-on-investigating-trump-idUSKCN1NV171 Impeaching Trump?

Only 2 presidents have been impeached, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and a third, Richard Nixon, was almost certainly going to be impeached had he not resigned. I thus started with the premise that only 3 out of 45 presidents have been impeached or were close enough that it should count. Thus the probability of any president being impeached is 3/45 or 6.67%. However, since World War II (my definition of the modern era) 2 of 13 presidents (15%) have been impeached or nearly certainly impeached. While the sample size is small, the percentages do reflect the general reluctance to use the impeachment process, except under the most extreme political circumstances, and, at least to date, in reaction to presidential actions (ostensibly criminal) that took place while in office. While there may be more of a willingness in the modern era to utilize the impeachment process against a president, it is still low probability. I thus started with a blended probability of 11%. In addition, there have been many presidents who have been accused of impeachable committing crimes and have had opposing party members submit impeachment resolutions against them. In the modern era, that\u2019s 7 presidents, with 2 impeachments/close enough to call it impeachment. That\u2019s still only 28%. I assumed that, to the extent there is at least some evidence of wrongdoing and the opposing party is in power in the House, the odds of impeachment for that subset of presidents is even higher, but will largely depend on the nature of the alleged wrongdoing. Let\u2019s call it 30-50%. I next compared this case to the 2 modern instances of impeachment/near impeachment\u2014Nixon and Clinton. In the Nixon matter, notably at the time of the Judiciary Committee vote, a Harris poll revealed that 53% of Americans thought Nixon should be impeached. The Judiciary Committee had held public hearings over several months and based on a deep investigation performed by its counsel after the Watergate grand jury and referred the matter to it, since it was the view at the time (and generally still is the DOJ\u2019s position) that a sitting president couldn\u2019t be indicted.  In Clinton matter, on the other hand, the Judiciary Committee held perfunctory hearings and instead relied on Independent Counsel Ken Starr\u2019s investigative report as the basis for the underlying determination that the president had committed crimes subject to impeachment. In both instances, the opposing party controlled the House, and in each some of the president\u2019s own party members voted for impeachment.  Here, new House leadership under the Democrats has indicated that impeachment will not be a priority. This makes sense for now, because the House had neither held robust (in the view of the Democrats) hearings nor has it yet to receive any report or other information regarding the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In addition, the latest polls show only about a 43% support for impeachment. The House will therefore likely begin investigations of the president and seek documents and information. Not only will these hearings be potentially politically damaging to the president, but to the extent he refuses to cooperate and produce requested documents/information, it also sets up the possibility of an impeachment charge of Obstruction of Congress. They can begin this soon while awaiting the Mueller report. Most media reporting seems to assume the Muller report will be issued soon, with speculation being sometime during the first quarter of 2019. However, the media have consistently gotten the timing wrong and have created unreasonable expectations about what Mueller might reveal in interim filings made with the court. However, given the length of time the investigation has been outstanding, it is not unreasonable to assume some kind of final report/wrap up delivered to the Justice Department by mid-2019. The question will then be what, if any, of that information will be shared with the Congress and the American public.  As a result, impeachment articles are not likely to be presented in the first six months of 2019. On the other hand, Mueller might have a bombshell that drives more immediate action, but given the length of the investigation and nature of the charges to date, it seems like anything against Trump will be either about where we are now in what we know or will take longer to release, as Mueller will need to deal with more inner circle people first. So I give that no more than a 10% chance, accounting for something completely unexpected out of Mueller and before hearings are completed in the House.  That only gives Democrats 2 summer months and September. Moreover, the longer the process is drawn out, there is an argument that the Democrats benefit from it remaining in the public eye, with Republicans uncomfortably dancing around the issue, defending a president they don\u2019t necessarily like but viewing the alternative as disastrous for the 2020 election. (Counterintuitively, some Republicans might hope for impeachment only so that Pence could come in to steady the ship until a better Republican candidate comes along in 2020 to save the party from political ruin. But given the extreme remedy, most Republicans will need strong evidence of real (in their view) crimes beyond campaign finance issues.) The sum of this is likely a drawn out process with move and countermove as the impeachment process slowly progresses over a number of months, adding pressure to the president and Republican party, leading into the 2020 primary. While some Democratic members of the House (particularly those with more progressive bases) may submit impeachment resolutions early on, those will likely get referred to the Judiciary Committee to allow the process to be drawn out for its political benefit.  In addition, impeachment brings both political uncertainty and, potentially, political turmoil. Working on the assumption that most politicians do genuinely care about those things (I\u2019m not a cynic), leadership of both parties recognize that impeachment really must only be used in the most egregious of circumstances. Democratic leaders such as Nancy Pelosi certainly recognize this and remember the fallout against both parties during the Clinton impeachment. Unless the Democratic leadership loses control of the issue to a maverick contingency in the House (or if polls overwhelmingly support impeachment\u2014both of which seem unlikely) it appears more probable, that while the Democrats will continue to keep the issue in the spotlight and perhaps even encourage some in the party to demand impeachment, any such process will last throughout most of 2019 and at least until the primaries in 2020. Given these political realities, impeachment, if at all, would likely occur later than October 2019. On the other hand, I\u2019ll allow some wiggle room for anything really damning coming out of Mueller\u2019s investigation. In addition, as information comes out from the investigation and hearings, the public\u2019s appetite for impeachment could increase to a point where Democrats are emboldened. They might see this no longer as an issue to be drawn out, but as a chance to take the high road and remove a president seen as harmful to the nation. If so, the summer would be the best time, as the 2020 election gears up with candidates vying for positions for the upcoming primaries and those supportive of an early and successful impeachment could point to their leadership in the process. While I don\u2019t think this is likely, it is an uncertainty that should be accounted for, particularly given we don\u2019t yet know what we will learn from the Mueller investigation. As a result, I put the chances of impeachment during the 3rd quarter higher than they would be during the first 6 months, but still only at about 25%. In light of an original chance of around 40% (I averaged the 30-50% range), this leads me to think the overall chance is no more than 14%.(40*.1)+(40*.25).\n"], [12335, "2018-12-15T03:15:22Z", [0.2], ""], [49359, "2018-12-15T00:12:56Z", [0.6], ""], [61704, "2018-12-14T22:09:38Z", [0.02], "With the current composition of the Senate, a conviction seems *very* unlikely, which suggests that House passing such articles would be (mostly) futile.

Mueller is set to expand his investigation in 2019 to Middle Eastern countries. So, does Mueller release a Russia report, then move on to the Middle East, or will it be one big report at the end? So, 99% there's something to find, maybe 95% chance it is found with all the folks that are cooperating with the investigation, I'll say 80% the House can and will act on it before the deadline if they have sufficient evidence. One report vs. 2 or more? Unless the leaders of those countries were working together, I would think the investigations could be rather compartmentalized. 80% chance that there could be two reports, 60% chance that there will be two if there can be two.  All percentages are just guesses. That comes out to 36%. There's also the emoluments case(s?) against him, but I have no idea what the timeframe for that is. https://www.thedailybeast.com/get-ready-for-muellers-phase-two-the-middle-east-connection"], [63543, "2018-12-14T07:42:33Z", [0.1], ""], [26030, "2018-12-14T06:37:39Z", [0.8], "The train is rolling down the track and those who want to stop it don't know how.

As for the logic of impeaching Trump, many forecasters have correctly pointed out that the Senate will almost certainly acquit him if he is impeached. To me this is irrelevant, because I believe to the Democrats in Congress it is irrelevant. John Edwards was indicted in a criminal court for similar campaign finance violations (i.e. paying off a mistress) and was acquitted. The charge is almost impossible to prove; how do you prove that he made the payoffs to conceal the affair from the voters and not merely from his wife? If he paid the money out of pocket, does that count as \"campaign funds\" because he self-financed much of his campaign and money is fungible? There is plenty of room for reasonable doubt. I don't think that will keep the Democrats from impeaching Trump. Moreover, even if Trump were to be found guilty in the Senate and removed from office, Pence would become President, and being the straight-arrow boy scout type that he professes to be (and presumably is) he would be well placed to run in 2020 as an corrective to sleazeball Trump.

Arguments: 1) Mueller's investigation could go on for many more months. Available information suggests he may be close to forming a view about what happened in the 2015-16 campaign, but that still leaves the post-election period and the obstruction of justice issue in February-May 2017. Trump has refused to answer questions about these two issues, but I doubt Mueller will just accept that. Moreover, Trump is under pressure from McConnell to nominate a permanent AG, and I think Mueller will wait for that to increase the perceived legitimacy of his report. So Mueller's report will be ready, I expect, no earlier that April-June 2019. This leaves little time for discussions and decisions before the deadline of this question. 2) What will Mueller's report contain when it is ready? Anything less than a clear smoking gun will likely lead to months of extensive discussions among the Democrats how to react. Again, the deadline is too soon.  3) An intriguing possibility is that Mueller will report that Trump lied under oath about certain issues. Trump's lawyers were consulting extensively with Manafort's lawyers under their joint defense agreement, and now we know that Mueller thinks Manafort lied (I suppose he can prove it). So if the Manafort and Trump answers were coordinated, Trump may be exposed. However, even this may not be quite the smoking gun the Democrats need, as Trump's answers were \"to the best of his recollection\", and the inaccurate answers may pertain to relatively minor events. (This is different from Bill Clinton's impeachment (for lying under oath), because there the lying was about issues central to the investigation.) So this brings us back to point 2) above. 4) Finally, even if Mueller does find a clear smoking gun of an impeachable offense, the Democrats would still want to attract at least some Republican votes in the House, to prevent the whole exercise being seen as a purely partisan affair. This again will take a few months to negotiate.  5) Can Trump be impeached for non-Mueller-related offenses? The Dems will start a few investigations - on his receiving money from foreign governments,  etc. Careful investigations will take many months, so no definite result before Oct 1. Besides, the Dems would likely plan these investigations to finish in 2020, in time for the presidential elections.

There's a lot of speculation,  such as this article in the Washington Post, that identifies Trump as an individual of interest, i.e. \"Individual 1\", in a criminal investigation.[1] But, at this point, no one outside of the Mueller investigation knows what they have - but there are an awful lot of indictments, many with uncharged individuals.  How much time does impeachment take? The articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton occurred during the lame duck session, just what we have going on now, and little real investigation. It took a month. Nixon, on the other hand, took six months to report back articles of impeachment to the House.  So, the questions are, at this point: \n1. When will Mueller present his case? I think he is near his endgame, since Trump is being identified as a person of interest, and Trump has turned in his responses to Mueller, but Mueller probably still needs a few months.\n2. How long will it take for the House to pass a resolution giving its judicial committee authority to investigate?  They won't do it before Mueller concludes his investigation, since there has already been so many phony Congressional investigations on this topic.\n3. Once those two things happen, it's going to have to go through a whole process of Congressional review and partisan politics. How long does that take? I'm guessing this is going to be a lot more complicated than Watergate, which means more time. The time limit is key here. The gears of justice grind slowly, particularly when its a powerful person like the President with a lot of tools to draw out the game. I don't think that anything starts until Mueller is finished. I think Mueller is nearing his endgame. But, this environment is going to be challenging and its going to be like a reality show.
