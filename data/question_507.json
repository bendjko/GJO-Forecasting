Since both groups (especially the Taliban) rely somewhat on local tribal communities for support, and wish to avoid taking any actions that would compel the United States and NATO to redeploy increased numbers of troops back to Afghanistan, it would be a strategically disastrous move by either group to systematically kill 1000+ Afghan civilians.
