They document widespread, unlawful killings by the security forces and vigilantes, including several massacres; rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and children; the widespread, systematic, pre-planned burning of tens of thousands of Rohingya homes and other structures by the military, BGP and vigilantes \nacross northern Rakhine State from 25 August until at least October 2017; and severe, ongoing restrictions on humanitarian assistance for remaining Rohingya villagers.23 Crisis Group\u2019s analysis of population data for northern Rakhine State from various sources suggests that around 85 per cent of the Rohingya population in these three townships has fled to Bangladesh over the last twelve months, leaving behind only 100,000-150,000.

The group has released a batch of new satellite images that it says show 820 structures were destroyed between 10-18 November\". The military is conducting security operations in Rakhine but the government denies it is razing homes. The Rohingya are one of the world's most persecuted minority groups. The BBC cannot independently verify the extent of destruction in Rohingya villages as the government has blocked international journalists from visiting the area, from where tens of thousands of people have fled. But a BBC correspondent on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border has spoken with fleeing Rohingya families who described what was happening in northern Rakhine as \"hell on earth\". No joy in this one.

In November, Bangladesh signed a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of the refugees. MSF said the agreement was \"premature\" pointing out that \"currently people are still fleeing\" and reports of violence have come even in recent weeks. The group also warned there was still very limited access for aid groups into Rakhine state. Total Deaths\n\"Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has said it believes at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after violence broke out in Myanmar in August. Based on surveys of refugees in Bangladesh, the number is much higher than Myanmar's official figure of 400. MSF said it was \"the clearest indication yet of the widespread violence\" by Myanmar authorities. What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence, and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured,\" MSF Medical Director Sidney Wong said. \"Cause of Death\"\nAccording to MSF: 69% of the violence-related deaths were caused by gunshots\n9% were due to being burnt to death in their houses\n5% were beaten to death.\nAmong the dead children below the age of five, MSF says more than 59% were reportedly shot, 15% burnt to death, 7% beaten to death and 2% killed by landmine blasts. The Myanmar military blames the violence on \"terrorists\" and has denied any wrongdoing. More than 647,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since August, MSF says. Is the refugee crisis 'textbook ethnic cleansing'?\nSeeing through the official story in Myanmar\nThe injured sheltering in Bangladesh\nWhat sparked the Rakhine violence?\nThe aid group's survey found that at least 9,000 Rohingya died in Myanmar, also known as Burma, between 25 August and 24 September. \"In the most conservative estimations\" at least 6,700 of those deaths have been caused by violence, including at least 730 children under the age of five, according to MSF. Previously, the armed forces stated that around 400 people had been killed, most of them described as Muslim terrorists.\" Regarding the IFP there is evidence that there has been a reduction in scale of attacks. Once could argue that the  1000 limit will not be triggered due to lack of evidence. Given the intense and ongoing efforts by relief groups to document the genocide when the grim accounting is done there is a high likelihood that over 1000 deaths in this period. \nAlthough Myanmar is not an ICC signatory, there will be continued collection of data and the  materiality of the data is clear.\nThe continuation of this genocide  after UN warning and regime promises to stop demonstrates the culpability of the highest state actors in Myanmar and will continue\n(edited 06:16 12-13)"], [368, "2017-12-13T18:22:32Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-12-12T22:47:01Z", [0.04], ""], [368, "2017-12-12T00:25:40Z", [0.05], ""], [40642, "2017-12-11T23:05:00Z", [0.3], ""], [368, "2017-12-10T19:37:41Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2017-12-10T15:40:32Z", [0.85], ""], [12828, "2017-12-10T15:04:52Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2017-12-10T14:40:33Z", [0.06], ""], [368, "2017-12-10T01:11:00Z", [0.05], ""], [42239, "2017-12-09T17:10:09Z", [0.8], ""], [368, "2017-12-08T21:20:21Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-12-08T15:38:56Z", [0.04], ""], [2965, "2017-12-08T02:49:09Z", [0.7], "strongly think recent bbc.com documents October killings in excess of 1000\nThe impact of Tillerson's visit, Popes visit yet to be clear.\nHate to say this but at 100,000 people dead\n8000 a month\nSee https://tribune.com.pk/story/1503524/situation-myanmar-textbook-example-ethnic-cleansing-un/\n\" 5 December 2017 \u2013 The United Nations human rights chief on Tuesday called for an international criminal probe into the perpetrators of the widespread and brutal attacks that have driven more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar since August, noting that \u201celements of genocide\u201d against the minority could not be ruled out. Rohingyas have faced decades of statelessness, policies of dehumanizing discrimination and segregation, and the horrific violence and abuse, along with the forced displacement and systematic destruction of villages, homes, property and livelihoods, said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein. \u201cGiven all of this, can anyone rule out that elements of genocide may be present?\u201d he told the Human Rights Council in Geneva in a special session convened in response to the ongoing exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar to Bangladesh. \u201cUltimately, this is a legal determination only a competent court can make. But the concerns are extremely serious, and clearly call for access to be immediately granted for further verification,\u201d he added. The High Commissioner urged the Council to consider making a recommendation to the UN General Assembly that it establish a new impartial and independent mechanism, complementary to the work of the fact-finding mission into the latest wave of violence and abuses, to assist individual criminal investigations of those responsible.\" Until UN gets in have to believe that such a systematic campaign\nwaged with genocide continued into October based on refugee count\n\"The report by the Inter Sector Coordination Group of the UN includes data up to October 14 and said the UN had been able to verify the arrival of 18,000 new refugees last week, EFE news reported\"\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/world-news/un-raises-number-of-rohingya-refugees-in-bangladesh-to-537-000-1763336\nWe may find up to 100,000 dead  but burning villages destroys evidence"], [40318, "2017-12-08T01:03:35Z", [0.75], ""], [40318, "2017-12-08T01:03:16Z", [0.65], ""], [368, "2017-12-07T16:37:12Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-12-06T20:30:18Z", [0.05], ""], [15196, "2017-12-06T05:57:03Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-12-05T18:55:40Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-12-04T21:12:52Z", [0.06], ""], [22132, "2017-12-04T02:27:35Z", [0.55], ""], [368, "2017-12-04T01:13:35Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-12-02T18:52:17Z", [0.05], ""], [12302, "2017-12-02T16:26:59Z", [0.07], ""], [42013, "2017-12-01T05:45:06Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-11-30T22:29:54Z", [0.05], ""], [40642, "2017-11-30T21:40:42Z", [0.5], ""], [41270, "2017-11-30T19:18:24Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2017-11-30T17:03:35Z", [0.08], ""], [42026, "2017-11-30T16:15:30Z", [0.75], ""], [42019, "2017-11-30T11:28:18Z", [0.18], ""], [368, "2017-11-29T19:27:38Z", [0.85], ""], [41958, "2017-11-28T21:14:21Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-28T20:39:25Z", [0.18], ""], [41924, "2017-11-28T16:12:16Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-11-28T01:13:49Z", [0.85], ""], [368, "2017-11-28T01:13:21Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-11-27T02:24:32Z", [0.05], ""], [41270, "2017-11-26T21:18:09Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2017-11-26T01:40:51Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-11-24T16:38:54Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-11-24T16:21:21Z", [0.4], ""], [368, "2017-11-24T01:29:56Z", [0.05], ""], [41523, "2017-11-23T05:45:14Z", [0.85], ""], [368, "2017-11-23T00:12:34Z", [0.05], ""], [368, "2017-11-22T00:24:01Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-11-21T21:48:30Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2017-11-20T21:45:03Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-11-20T18:03:38Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2017-11-19T23:58:01Z", [0.25], ""], [373, "2017-11-19T20:35:19Z", [0.2], ""], [37250, "2017-11-19T15:14:19Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-19T00:46:57Z", [0.25], ""], [41482, "2017-11-18T23:27:55Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-18T19:56:49Z", [0.48], ""], [1333, "2017-11-18T19:33:03Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-11-17T21:47:18Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-11-17T21:46:50Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-17T15:15:35Z", [0.48], ""], [368, "2017-11-16T19:56:43Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-15T22:10:30Z", [0.45], "There is little doubt that enough people will be murdered.
