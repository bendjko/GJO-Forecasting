As of April 1 there were 105.4 million single dose vaccinations and 44.8 full vaccinations, a difference of 60.6 million. So for Pfizer and Moderna I think that will be the ballpark increase in full vaccinations (plus a few million more because Pfizer's lag is only 21 days). So that would be about 44.8 + 60 = 105 million full vaccinations. That's not counting additional J&J shots.
