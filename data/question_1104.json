May 2019's (3 months out) figure is +1.2%, continuing a gradual downward trend. For the ranges in the question: < -3%: Looks very unlikely as you'd need to drop by -4.3% in 3 months. Although the track record does show very fast swings, these are pretty rare and correlate with wider indicators (e.g. the last one with the financial crisis to which housing was highly exposed) which aren't observed here. Also, the indicator very rarely strays negative. -3% to -1%: This still looks unlikely for similar reasons (HPI is rarely negative, and drops of 2.3%/3months would be off the fairly autocorrelated trends), but not incredible. -1% to 1%: I place the bulk of my credence here firstly predicting the gradual decline will continue, and 0.2% in 3 months is very plausible. Also, although (I understand) housing a defensive investment, I'd guess political instability about Brexit would probably push in the downwards direction (although not so dramatically to go below -1%). 1 to 3%: My next most plausible option, as although close to the threshold the trend may reverse or have jitters, but again unlikely to surge up the 1.9% to exit the range. >3%: Similar to <-3%, but fractionally more plausible as less distance to go, HPI generally positive, etc. etc. One more thing: when you look at the Nov 2018 report, you see a value of 2.8% [3]. However, if you consult more recent reports, they give the figure for Nov 2018 as 2.6% [1] [2]. I haven't sleuthed carefully enough to understand why this is the case (revising estimates for greater accuracy?), but insofar as this suggests noise from the ground truth, it would point to widening credence across the ranges, especially as the current value is very close a cutpoint.

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into \"more than 3%\" interval. Tough luck. \nHowever, the employment figures are still good and increase in minimum wage from April (typically for young / first time buyers' spouse) may bring even more first time buyers to the regional and cheaper than 230K market. Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019. First time buyers tend to overpay so there is a good chance for increase as the entire baseline will move a bit. \nThe issue is London which has substantial weight on average prices. The recent witch hunt of foreign-money-laundering activities may have some negative effect and may cool off the London market even further.

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into \"more than 3%\" interval. Tough luck. \nHowever, the employment figures are still good and increase in minimum wage from April (typically for young / first time buyers' spouse) may bring even more first time buyers to the regional and cheaper than 230K market. Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019. First time buyers tend to overpay so there is a good chance for increase as the entire baseline will move a bit. \nThe issue is London which has substantial weight on average prices. The recent witch hunt of foreign-money-laundering activities may have some negative effect and may cool off the London market even further.

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into \"more than 3%\" interval.

Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019.

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into \"more than 3%\" interval. Tough luck. \nHowever, the employment figures are still good and increase in minimum wage from April (typically for young / first time buyers' spouse) may bring even more first time buyers to the regional and cheaper than 230K market. Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019. First time buyers tend to overpay so there is a good chance for increase as the entire baseline will move a bit. \nThe issue is London which has substantial weight on average prices. The recent witch hunt of foreign-money-laundering activities may have some negative effect and may cool off the London market even further. Still a 60 million mansion is negligible on grand scale of things since there were 100.000 seasonally adjusted property transactions in February 2019 at average price of 228,000. This brings us to \u00a322.8 billion worth of houses changing hands every month or 12.5 % of GDP (UK GDP 511.5 billion in Q4 2018 or roughly 170 bn a month).

The problem is that this number is hard to beat given that with the seasonal changes  removed by ONS in January 2019 the average price was 228,147. This technically already 1.3 lower than in September 2018. That means the prices need to go up from 228,147 in Feb 2019 to 238,740 in September 2019 to get into \"more than 3%\" interval. Tough luck. \nHowever, the employment figures are still good and increase in minimum wage from April (typically for young / first time buyers' spouse) may bring even more first time buyers to the regional and cheaper than 230K market. Therefore, there is still a good chance to achieve slightly above 1% growth, e.g. ca. 234K average price in September 2019. First time buyers tend to overpay so there is a good chance for increase as the entire baseline will move a bit. \nThe issue is London which has substantial weight on average prices. The recent witch hunt of foreign-money-laundering activities may have some negative effect and may cool off the London market even further. Still a 60 million mansion is negligible on grand scale of things since there were 100.000 seasonally adjusted property transactions in February 2019 at average price of 228,000. This brings us to \u00a322.8 billion worth of houses changing hands every month or 12.5 % of GDP (UK GDP 511.5 billion in Q4 2018 or roughly 170 bn a month).

If there is a no deal Brexit between 29th March and 30th September (9% probability), I would also assume that a future that is like the worst of the recent past becomes more likely, but as the time between the crisis trigger and the close date of the question is shorter, I adjust my bucket probabilities for this scenario so that the bucket including 0% change gets the highest probability, with a more pessimistic overall outlook.

Additionally, with regard to the Inside View @nigster makes a good point that Brexit hasn't had a visible impact on the house price index. Indeed, one would expect that the short term effects of Brexit are mostly reflected in financial and currency markets, while markets like housing are more stable. It is generally the case that the former are more volatile and the latter is more stable. That is why real estate is considered a defensive investment after all.

Results: 2, 6, 14, 20, 59 (rounded).  It seems quite bullish relative to GJO so far and relative to the range of the question. But the model reflects an important fact: historically, house prices have gone up more often than down or sideways. On average, they have grown 0.4%/mo since 2000. If you just project using that average growth rate from the November number, you'd get an annual growth of 3.5% from Sept 2018 to Sept 2019.  Additionally, the model is helpful in providing a sense for the range of uncertainty we can expect based on the historical variance in prices.
