Renzi's office said in a statement Monday that the centre-left premier would be in the Islamic Republic on April 12 and 13, without giving further details of his itinerary. Italy has led the way among Western countries in re-establishing economic ties to Iran following the lifting of international sanctions imposed over concerns the country was seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capacity. An accord to lift the sanctions was agreed last year and came into force in January. Renzi's trip follows Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Italy and France at the end of January -- a trip which resulted in a string of major trade and investment deals being signed between Tehran and the two European countries. Contracts worth an estimated 17 billion euros ($18 billion) were signed in Rome and Rouhani said he hoped that would represent only a start, as he pitched Iran as a safe base for investors looking to get into a regional market of 300 million consumers. Iran has said it wants European help to modernise and expand its rail, road and air networks as well as seeking investment to boost its manufacturing base, notably in the automobile sector. Italy was Iran's largest European trade partner before the impact of sanctions caused exchanges between the two countries to collapse.As he seeks to consolidate Italy's early lead in the race for business deals, Renzi has also unveiled plans for cultural and academic exchanges.\""], [12302, "2016-04-04T12:25:58Z", [0.99], ""], [67, "2016-04-04T12:11:38Z", [0.96], ""], [136, "2016-04-04T12:10:21Z", [1.0], "@ESL_Br's link http://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/196458"], [12874, "2016-04-04T12:00:23Z", [1.0], ""], [22665, "2016-04-04T11:38:40Z", [0.99], "https://www.yahoo.com/news/italy-pm-matteo-renzi-visit-iran-april-12-111252870.html"], [68, "2016-04-04T11:21:02Z", [0.85], "Reducing from 100 for lack of confirmatory news about Renzi's visit this month."], [22973, "2016-04-04T06:57:08Z", [0.55], ""], [14301, "2016-04-04T02:27:20Z", [0.39], ""], [4218, "2016-04-04T01:01:05Z", [0.27], "The Abe visit doesn't look like it will happen until August.

The relevant \"international institutions\" include Iran and the countries of the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). To begin looking at Iran, it is important to consider the effects of its most recent election (http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11139970/iran-elections). The election results affirmed the nuclear deal, revealed a push from the Iranian people to open up more to the West, and pointed to a trend of rising moderates in Iran. These effects show a change in the norms and protocols of Iran, whose government has been traditionally been closed off to the West and viewed as \"extremist.\" Because of these apparent changes in norms, it seems more likely than ever that Iran will host a G7 country in the coming months.  Additionally, with the U.S. at the lead, the G7 countries have made recent moves to be more open to Iran, fueled by the nuclear deal. This reveals that the norms between this international \"institution\" (the G7), the countries that comprise it, and the country of Iran. It would logically follow that, as trust between these entities builds, the norms between them would become more open, thus leading to a likely official state visit.  I will update this prediction as more news of the aftermath of Iran's election and the attitudes of the G7 countries is developed and revealed.

The two countries can export their joint products to the regional markets via Iran, he added.

Japan isn\u2019t alone, of course: Russia, China and several European countries have been stepping up their efforts to get an early foothold in the Iranian market as it opens back up to the world. Japan\u2019s motivation to compete for a share of the investment opportunities in Iran is unambiguous. As Yoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief Cabinet secretary, recently explained about the bilateral investment treaty: \u201cThe aim of these negotiations is to protect the investment activities of Japanese companies. Japan will take the necessary steps and not be later than other nations.\u201d \"One of Japan\u2019s key targets is Iran\u2019s potentially lucrative Azadegan oil fields, near the border with Iraq.  . . . . Japan, after all, remains highly dependent on foreign sources of energy, especially from the Middle East; last year, more the 80 percent of Japan\u2019s crude oil imports came from the region. The largest suppliers are countries from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), such as Saudi Arabia (34 percent), the United Arab Emirates (24 percent), Qatar (11 percent) and Kuwait (7 percent). Iran\u2019s market share of oil exports to Japan has dropped precipitously over the past decade, from a peak of 16 percent of Japan\u2019s total oil imports in 2003 to 5 percent last year.\n\" . . . Tokyo\u2019s energy needs have been magnified by the four-year self-imposed moratorium on nuclear reactors as a result of the 2011 nuclear crisis at Fukushima. Only recently have a few reactors gone back online in the country. Japan previously relied on nuclear power generation for nearly a third of its domestic energy. \" . .  .Abe has made three trips to the Middle East since he was elected in December 2012. His extensive itineraries included visits to Turkey (twice), Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. With the Iran deal and potentially improved ties between Tehran and the international community, it is possible that Abe may look to visit Iran in the coming years. At the very least, one can expect a higher exchange of senior diplomats and business people between the two countries. Just last month, Japan\u2019s vice minister for economy, trade and industry visited Tehran, accompanied by several business officials in the oil and gas sector. \"Yet despite these positive trends, Japan will likely take a cautious route in its reset with Iran, even if the mutual investment deal is reached and Japanese businesses return to Iran. Tokyo remains sensitive to the lingering problems in the relationship between its key ally, the U.S., and Iran, which are not limited to the nuclear issue. During a meeting with Iran\u2019s foreign minister earlier this year, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, expressed concern about longstanding military ties between Iran and North Korea and requested that Iran sever \u201call military cooperation with North Korea.\u201d Japan is also opposed to any destabilizing activities that Iran is undertaking in Yemen and Syria. And on the nuclear issue, Japan, as a strong opponent of nuclear proliferation, must continue to insist that Iran remain transparent and in compliance with the nuclear agreement. Investment might be a carrot for compliance, but it won\u2019t overshadow deeper political sensitivities that will continue to keep Japan-Iran ties modest in the short term.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \". . .  to visit Iran in the coming yearS\".
