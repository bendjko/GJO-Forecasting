Just want to do a bit of a postmortem. I went and stayed below 10% in this question way back in March 2017, when consensus was still above 70%. Highest I ever was, was 30%, for 2 weeks back in December 2016. I paid very little attention to the daily developments of the Russia / Trump campaign controversy. My prediction was based, in order of importance, on: (i) base rates, such presidential visits usually happen later in the term, and, particularly, several months after the first meeting in a multilateral setting (e.g. the G-20, which was in July this year);\n(ii) the actual conflict involving actual bombs (as opposed to just a bunch of talking) in Syria;\n(iii) the actual sanctions involving actual economic consequences (as opposed to just a bunch of talking);\n(iv) the suggestion of, but non-following through with, a bilateral meeting in Slovenia; \n(v) the bunch of talking around Putin having influenced the election. Arguably (v) could have been important in that, if lots of people are angry that Putin influenced the election, it would put pressure on Trump not to meet with him. I'm sure that happened to some extent. But people forecasting on this question probably pay more attention to politics than the average person, and thus may overestimate how angry the AVERAGE person actually is at this. And politicians only care about the average person. Plus, very little has ACTUALLY HAPPENED on this front beyond a bunch of talking. ONE GUY resigned, and I think that's pretty much it. There's hearings and whatnot but that is extremely easy for Republicans to rationalize away. (Cf. Democrats with Hillary-related hearings.)"], [13773, "2017-09-29T19:03:04Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-29T18:27:58Z", [0.0], ""], [38212, "2017-09-29T17:29:58Z", [0.0], ""], [485, "2017-09-29T15:49:28Z", [0.0], "We appear to be in a real-time \"active measures\" influence operation and attack by Russian intelligence and the Putin administration against U.S. society.

This inside help appears to include Facebook, Twitter and social media as well as friends of Putin and his associates within American society and the U.S. government.

nothing given the short period of time left before the deadline and the length of time generally required to set up such formal events. Given the lack of any discussion of a bilateral meeting and no evidence of an existing invitation, the chances would seem extremely slim.  In March 2017, a bilateral visit between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China was formally announced in only 12 days, between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s Beijing visit on March 18th and the formal announcement on March 30th, which was noted to be an extremely quick turnaround. The meeting did not take place until roughly a week later. Even if a similarly unprecedented timeline might be forecast for a potential meeting between Trump and Putin, there is no chatter about an upcoming trip for Secretary Tillerson to Moscow (he was last in Russia in April), which would likely be a catalyst for such a bilateral meeting to occur.  Trump already has a bilateral meeting scheduled this week with Malaysia's Prime Minister. Particularly with the recent devastation due to multiple hurricanes hitting the southeastern United States, it is unlikely Trump will make a trip abroad this month for any multilateral meetings (none are so far announced), and therefore he will be unlikely to set in motion the process of inviting Putin to the White House before October 1, 2017, or of being invited to the Kremlin.

But, the effect of POTUS signing the new Russian sanctions bill may in fact spur discussion over how to better handle the relationship between the two countries.  I admit, that consequence seems unlikely to manifest, particularly with the Trump-Russia issues that permeate every facet of U.S. politics these days.  That being considered, Trump has an incentive - maintaining a semblance of credibility and deniability in the face of U.S. media - to avoid direct interaction with Russia at all costs if it has any potential to be construed as favoring Russia.  On the other hand, Putin would seem to have a small incentive to engage with the U.S. given both these new sanctions and the Pentagon's recent indication that it was prepared to get involved in Ukraine in some capacity.  Add in Russia's planned military exercises on NATO boarders, and you have a situation that is ripe for disaster and also prime for discussion.  Thus, although Trump would lose political capital by reaching out, Putin would not and would stand to gain in the eyes of the international community bu reaching out before any military action (exercises or otherwise) came to bear.

My hypothesis: they were being actively mislead by their sources of classified information. Here is a start at either supporting or falsifying that hypothesis. Comparison class: Post 9-11, intelligence that Iraq had not dismantled its weapons of mass destruction programs. There were some elements of active deception by both the Saddam Hussein regime and anti-regime forces such as Ahmad Chalabi. Hussein\u2019s strategy was to keep his enemies uncertain of his regime\u2019s capabilities. Chalabi\u2019s motivation was to get the U.S. to put him into power in place of Hussein. Anti-comparison class #1: Advances in psychology outside the published scientific literature are making major gains on the Big Lie and other persuasion techniques pioneered in the 20th Century.  Anti-comparison example: use of Cambridge Analytica by the Trump team to surgically target a winning basket of electoral college votes despite losing the popular vote by ~2.8M. https://cambridgeanalytica.org/. They also provided psychographic message targeting for the successful Brexit \"Leave\" campaign Anti-comparison class #2: Today the science and technology underlying these sorts of disinformation campaigns is evolving fast. IMHO, the most important challenge facing intelligence professionals is the dynamics of computationally-based disinformation and how to fold in human forecasters in such a way as to provide them with the best possible data sources. Anti-comparison example: Brexit. Pundits, polls, betting markets, Gjopen and even the Good Judgment, Inc. superforecaster team were all predicting a Remain win, with a high degree of confidence. Only the Websays.com hybrid forecasting system (working with the SENSEI Consortium) was successful, likely because it used humans in the loop along with machine learning to filter out computational propaganda scripting attacks. Indeed, their final three days of forecasting pegged Leave\u2019s final vote share at 51.79% vs the final election result of 51.9%. One likely contributing factor to the failings of human forecasters: a recent research note published at https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06356 reports heavy bot activity in the Brexit campaign. This problem of computational propaganda scripting attacks also has been documented and analyzed by recent and current research funded by DARPA\u2019s Twitter Bot Challenge, and the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Division of Social and Economic Sciences, which analyzed bot activity in the Brexit campaigns and U.S. Presidential campaign.

Medvedev also attended group summits in 2011 and 2012 and Puting one in 2004). That implies an average of 1 bilateral Russian Presidential visit every 2.1 years. Source: https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/visits/russia Alternatively, focusing on Putin only - he has made 6 bilateral visits to the US in his 13 years as President (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2015), i.e. excluding the May 2008-May 2012 period when Medvedev was President. (the 2000 visit is not from wiki link but from the previous link from US department of history).  This implies an average of 1 visit every 2.2 years. source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Vladimir_Putin.  The above two data points imply a Russian President visit to the US occurs once every c. 2.1 years.  Now how likely is it for the US President to visit Russia? According to wiki, the likelihood is 1 visit every 2 years on average, going back to 1993 (12 visits over 24 years). Clinton had 5 visits, Bush 6 and Obama 1 (in 2009, I don't believe there was a bilateral meeting during the 2013 G20 summit). source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_trips_made_by_the_President_of_the_United_States Simply adding these probabilities together would yield a c. 47% chance of Russia visiting US and a c. 50% chance of US visiting Russia, so a combined c. 97%. But this is lazy thinking because in practice, in some years, there was a both a visit to the US and one to Russia. In fact, going back 24 years to 1993, there have been 16 years with a bilateral meeting of the two Presidents, and 8 with no meeting - i.e. an a-priori probability of 67%. However, I start with a higher probability than this due to:\n- Obama and Russia clearly had a colder relationship (3 meetings in 8 years) than previous presidents (13 meetings in 16 years), and indeed than it seems Trump is keen to engender a closer relationship\n- Using the ex-Obama period implies a starting probability of 81% (13 out of 16)\n- The fact Trump will likely want to start his presidency showing that he means business by having a high-profile meeting with Putin in my eyes raises the probability even further (perhaps 10-15%)\n- However, the question ends on 1 October 2017, which cuts out 3 months of the year. I therefore drop the likelihood a little for this (perhaps 5-7%) Combining the above, I start at a likelihood of 88%.\n"], [31574, "2016-12-19T16:39:04Z", [0.25], ""], [8888, "2016-12-19T16:21:34Z", [0.75], ""], [28424, "2016-12-19T16:20:42Z", [0.15], "Although Trump and Putin claim to be friends, both look out for #1, and once elected, i believe Trump may well find it politic not to go dashing to Russia.

BASE RATES\nA lot of my previous analysis started from base rates of presidential visits to *any* country. If we look at visits by/to just Russia, the base rate is different. For the greatest possible specificity, I will look only at official state visits to/from Russia upon inauguration of a new American president (i.e. reelection doesn't count). I will also restrict to post-1991, since arguably pre-1991 it was a whole different ball game and not so representative of the present. Three new presidents were inaugurated since then: Clinton in 1993, Bush in 2001, Obama in 2009. Of these, only Obama officially state visited Russia before Oct of his first year. That suggests a base rate of 33% for before-Oct meetings. If we want to get more precise, the first official visit between Russia & USA (in either direction) after a new American president was inaugurated took place: (i) 12 months after inauguration for Clinton;\n(ii) 10 months in for Bush; and\n(iii) 5.5 months in for Obama. This small dataset makes for an average of 9.2 and a standard deviation of 2.7; if we assume a normal distribution with these parameters, that makes for a 37% chance of the delay being < 8.3 months (necessary for occurrence before 1 Oct 2017). That's reassuringly close maybe? Let's call the base rate 35%. 2. OTHER MEETINGS\nI also looked more closely at other opportunities Trump & Putin would have to meet, outside of an official state visit. As it happens, Clinton, Bush and Obama all met with Russian leadership in non-state, multilateral meetings, before official state visits happened: (i) Clinton 3 times, the first being 10 months before first official visit;\n(ii) Bush twice, the first being 5 months before first official visit; and\n(iii) Obama once, 2 months before first official visit. Looking through Wikipedia [2,3] I tried to find systematic such opportunities for Trump & Putin to meet. The big obvious ones are the G-20 and G-8 summits. There are also APEC summits and various UN gatherings. The next G-20 meeting will be 7-8 July 2017. An official state visit would have to happen 2.7 months after that for the question to resolve positively. As it turns out, Russia is currently banned from the G-8 until further notice, due to the Ukraine situation. Next year the G-8 (currently G-7) will discuss conditions for Russia's return [4] but that will be after the question period has ended. As far as I can tell, the only UN meeting attended by Russian presidents (Medvedev & Putin) is the UN General Assembly. That's always in mid-September though, so unlikely to form the basis of a pre-October state visit. Finally, APEC summits since 2005 almost always happen in mid-November, with a couple exceptions in early September. Also seems unlikely to serve as basis of a pre-October state visit. 3. PUTIN IT TOGETHER\nAs I mentioned in my previous forecast, there are at least 3 sources of real tension between USA and Russia: (i) Ukraine; (ii) Snowden; (iii) Syria. Then we have the fact that only the G-20 meeting could provide a first Putin/Trump meeting. None of the last 3 American presidents have made or hosted a \"blind\" Russian state visit (i.e. w/o meeting elsewhere first). The G-20 meeting would only allow a 2.7 month window, about as short as Obama's window, and the Obama administration had a whole thing about \"resetting\" the relationship with Russia [5]. Conflicts (i)-(iii) make me think the window between G-20 meeting and official state visit should be longer than the norm. I think it's fair to say relations with Russia are as bad as they've been since Clinton? All this makes me want to more than halve the base rate, from 35% down to 15%. Finally, it could happen that an official state visit takes place for no other reason than for Trump & Putin to show off. Nothing gets accomplished, etc. I can't rule this out, let's give it a 10% chance. Total odds: 25%.

Contrary to election rhetoric, most probably Trump will focus on domestic issues and here nothing to be gained 6.\tThe only serious deal that justifies the state visit is America may need Russia to woo it from  China (like the opposite of Kissinger going to China), but China and the Soviet Union were hostile to each other at the time. There is no time for it in the question time frame.  So if we take a low base rate in single digits for state visit, apply the points from above and get something close to 0. The consensus is insane IMHO. But that is strictly my personal opinion.

Scrolling down a few pages I notice 80-90% of forecasts offer no supporting reasoning. About half of the ones that do offer reasoning are based purely on things Trump said, and do not cite any historical precedent. As some have noted below, the base rate for presidential visits to places is low; recent  presidents usually travel 10-20 times a year [1], and at least half of these is to attend meetings and summits, hence don't count as state visits. If we forget geopolitics and simply assume that there are ~50 countries the president could visit, this suggests a 10%-20% chance the president would \"state visit\" any given country in their first year. From the other end, state visits by foreign leaders to the USA are also rare. Wikipedia has a list [2] which drives home the point that there is a dizzying variety of types of visit, and official state visits are the minority. Under the \"Europe\" section --- which could be argued is the section most representative of Russia --- I counted 45 \"state visits\" and 71 \"official visits\". To reiterate, that is a total of 116 official/state visits for the entire continent of Europe since (depending on the country) WW1 / WW2 / the founding of the relevant country. Again forgetting geopolitics, if we say there are ~30 countries, that's ~4 official/state visits per country since WW2, or roughly 1 every 18 years, implying a probability of ~6% per year. For comparison, there have been 4 official/state visits from Russia since 1992, implying a rate of 1 every 6 years. However for Russia the visits are heavily skewed toward the past, in the few years after the collapse of the USSR. So the base rate for this question is something like (10% to 20%) + 6% ~ 20%. I can think of several reasons to drive this number down, and very few to drive it up. Driving it down, we have (i) Russian invasion of Ukraine, which the US dislikes, and has approved sanctions against; (ii) Russia providing asylum to Snowden, which the US strongly disapproves, Republicans most of all; (iii) Russia and US are on opposite sides of Syrian conflict. This means US-Russia relations are very strained, and only a minority of official/state visits are to countries with which relations are strained. Driving it up, we have (iv) Russia is a major power, and it is a priority to manage relations with it; (v) Trump said some nice things about Putin during the campaign; (vi) there are rumors that Trump has been in touch with Putin. I think base rates and (i)-(iii) will play the determining role in this question.  Note the difference between (i)-(iii) and (v)-(vi); (i)-(iii) are things that ACTUALLY HAPPENED, whereas (v)-(vi) are simply things people said. My general view is that talk is cheap. Trump hasn't even taken office yet and has already reneged on major campaign points (prosecuting Hillary, torturing terrorists). I think (iv) is an actual thing too, but I'm not sure official state visits are ever the first recourse toward normalizing strained relations. I find it more likely that Trump and Putin will feel each other out at summits and whatnot before committing to official state visits. Finally, some people are saying Trump could go for it because it would be an easy foreign policy win for him early in his presidency. But what kind of deal could he \"easily\" strike with Putin re Syria / Snowden? Only one where he gave Putin most of what he asks for. If I try to imagine that actually happening, I easily see his opponents painting such a deal as Trump being weak and caving to Putin. I don't think he wants that. On balance I'm tempted to adjust from the base rate of 20% down to 5% because of (i)-(iii) and up to 7% because of (iv)-(vi). But the deadline is far, so from general uncertainty I'll bump it up to 10%.

Explanation in edit below.]  [ Edit: Of the nine that happened during one of the five inauguration years only two were before October 1.

That is an average of about once every 17 years since 1992 for about a 5% chance in any given year. Notably there have been none in over 20 years.

I am assuming the same probability for Trump going to Russia for no reason other than I have not had time to check out any relevant base rates, but I suspect they will also surprise me on the down side. The outside view on that is that Trump's ego may be too big to not be the host in that scenario. Again, almost no weight assigned to that outside view.  For now I am starting with 6%.
