It could take a high-wire act for her to get there, largely thanks to the pandemic ... Democrats will have a 222-211 edge, with one race still undecided and one vacancy after Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., died Tuesday after battling COVID-19 ... The raging coronavirus pandemic, combined with routine illnesses and the usual risks of wintertime travel, could make attendance unpredictable for the first House roll call in months that lawmakers will have to attend in person ... No Democratic rival to Pelosi has emerged, greatly diminishing the odds she\u2019ll be toppled ... Even so, Pelosi must minimize the number of Democrats opposing her ... Some suggest the tight numbers might encourage Pelosi\u2019s Democratic critics to force the balloting into a rare second round, when she could eventually win but perhaps be forced into promises about bills the House would consider or other concessions.\" [1] Note that to be elected speaker, Pelosi only has to obtain an absolute majority of votes \u2014 not an absolute majority of the full membership of the House [2].
