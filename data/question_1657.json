Since this is the question I was most invested in forecasting recently, I'm doing a quick hindsight examination of my rationales. Broadly: pretty good, but also somewhat lucky. I think all five underlying conditions I posited here (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1060600) seem to have been correct, as was the use of slower-but-longer-growth version of first wave NY as my main comparison point. Working from those assumptions, the growth curve was fairly predictable, and my updates (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1064318) seem to have been pretty much on point. Where does the luck come in? If we'd been asked to forecast deaths instead of hospitalizations, I think I would have posited the same underlying conditions and then been very wrong in my forecasts (similarly to how I just can't seem to get a handle on how the data is moving in the AZ ICU question). I'm proud of the reads I made on this question, but I also think the data \"played nice\" here to an unusual extent, and there are many similar questions I would have been much less accurate on.

I could only speculate about the reasons for that: maybe the link between hospitalizations and the cases is more immediate than between hospitalizations and an average. On the other hand, a lot of infected people from mid-June on might have underestimated the severity of their disease and flushed into hospital especially late in late June, which coheres with the doctors' observations in Texas. A third explanation may be that the undetected (asymptomatic) positives of mid June 2020 may have had contact with especially vulnerable groups (such as individuals with preexisting conditions, obesity etc.) so that the condition of COVID-19 infected people in Texas deteriorated on average after 25 June 2020. However, this acceleration seems to have come to an end, as the coefficient has plateaud at around 1.28 for the three days after 06 July 2020, which of course does not mean that hospitalizations will sink from now on, but just means that the situation does not get worse ever faster. Anyway, I assumed that new cases will be slightly above 10k (10,036, to be precise) again, this will return an est. value for 7d-average of 7,803 for 09 July 2020. At a constant coefficient of 1.28, this suggests that hospitalizations will be an est. 10,004 cases today for the state of Texas, which would close the question already today with the highest bin.

So officials wasted 9 full days, which is probably the equivalent between an exponential growth-curve and an (almost) linear growth-curve in reality, and by chance the difference between my worst- and my worst worst case scenario. The inertia in TX health department and the chaotic testing environment seem to have messed it all up, maybe with respect to the Rep. campaign rally that was supposed to happen in Houston, TX soon and that is now obviously cancelled/prohibited by Houston mayor. Politics puts people at risk, as easy as this.\n+The numbers suggest that instead of one big wave there have been four smaller crests of a wave that rolled over Texas, but this to me is a false impression due to testing seasonality over the weekdays, which makes it harder for everyone to get a true estimate of the true situation in the state and that promotes wrong interpretations and incentives. Testing should instead be distributed as evenly as possible, since otherwise the overall picture will be distorted and blurred, and would result in a mixed messaging not only by politicians but also by the figures. If this continues, they will never find an appropriate way to respond.\n+I'm also pretty convinced that the spikes in positivity rate are an artifact that stems from cases related to tests that have been taken many days (or weeks) earlier before the result accidentally turned around on that day and it's been ready to be reported. This shows once more how important and crucial a consistent and orderly testing procedure with accurate and timely results really is. They've messed that up, too. (3)\nThe other thing that I mentioned somewhere is that it seemed to me that Texas was maybe on the same path as Brazil. So let's compare, how both states were faring after one day and 19 days after they reached about 100,000 cumulative cases: \tBrasil\t\n03 May 2020\t101,147\t\n04 May 2020\t105,222\t4,03%\n23 May 2020\t310,087\t206,57%\n\n\tTexas\t\n18 June 2020  99,851\t\n19 June 2020 103,305\t3,46%\n08 July 2020\t220,564\t120,89%\nThis tells us much about the importance of \"initial trajectory\" of the spread.

In round numbers, hospitalizations held steady at about 1750 during May. Meanwhile new positive tests averaged 1167 in May. I'm no mathematician, but I'll call that a 1.5 ratio. I'm no epidemiologist, but I would argue that they will continue to track each other going forward. Currently Texas has a positivity rate of 14% vs about 5-6% in May so if anything I would expect the ratio to be somewhat higher now.  For the last 7 days Texas has averaged 6917 new positive results / day which implies a hospitalization of about 10.4k. If we continue on our current pace we'll pass 10k some time around July 9-12. Why might this not happen?\n1) they hit up against a limit of beds: nope, there are over 12k available.\n2) if this is the peak and the curve flattens due to bar closures, renewed social distancing efforts etc could we avoid going over 10k? Yes I think that's possible. I give it a 5% probability due to a) this is Texas and they don't like being told what to do; and b) the disease has a lot of inertia, so I assume a peak today in cases would result in a peak for hospitalizations in 1-2 weeks, after we hit 10k.

It had a peak of 8k for hospitalizations. TX had around 5-6k cases for the last week, and has 6.5k hospitalizations. Perhaps they are finding many more asymptomatic people than NJ was back in April, who don't need hospitalization. The questions now are (1) how much are hospitalizations lagging the cases? and (2) how quickly with the daily cases come down? For (1) NJ hit its peak number of hospitalizations two weeks into hanging around the 4k per day number. With that in mind, we can expect another week of growth based on where we are now. For (2) TX is not going to close down quickly [4], like NJ and NY did. I have a hard time imagine it will stay open as the hospital beds and ICUs fill up, but I'm also not a Texan, so can't speak to the mindset. (1) says another 4500 in the next 7 days, assuming the same daily addition to the number of patients, which easily puts it over 10k.

(we were talking about 1,800 at that time long ago). I don't know if this correlation is of particular value to anyone.\nTo me it seems like the 7-day average of cases (to the left) is some leading indicator of a wave of hospitalizations (to the right) about four to five days ahead. So the jump in hospitalizations on 23 June 2020 may be a result of the growth in cases gathered in the average cases data of 18/19 June 2020. So with 5,489 new cases as of 23 June 2020, and new cases assumed remaining just about constant above 5,000 per day until 28 June 2020, we could observe the 5,000 threshold in hospitalizations cracked on 27/28 June 2020, or maybe end up even slightly higher (5,150 in particular, depending on the actual confirmed cases rate by then). And just to add worse news to the bad, and to end any wishful thinking, or dreams, of herd immunity of Republicans:\nThere are strong signs, that\n- the size of immunity due to antibodies built in the blood of an infected and recovered patient will be proportionate to the severity of symptoms, which means that low symptomatic or asymptomatic persons (80 per cent of the cases) will be provided with a low or insignificant level of protection from a re-infection.\n- antibodies found in the blood of recovered patients are less stable over time than initially hoped for/expected, so immunity may be gone after weeks or months again completely.\nThe only hopes remaining to me seem:\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone\nDexamethasone may prove to be a cheap, widely available and appropriate treatment to improve overall health of infected persons in hospitals, and will lower the average severity of COVID-2019 for people in ICU treatment, with shorter average hospitalization as a result.\n- Remdesivir could in an alternative application also be used for inhalation through an aerosol, which could then prove more effective than the initially intended treatment as a liquid.

Cases and hospitalizations continue to rise at an extremely rapid rate that's only becoming more rapid. It will be at least a week until substantial changes in public policy and/or personal behavior, and it will be weeks after that until those changes are reflected in the hospitalization data. Even then, it will be some time before the curve reverses, rather than just slowing. Texas population size means the ceiling on hospitalizations is frighteningly high.

The exponential growth characteristics of viruses. \n2. The lag in case detection and especially hospitalizations. Hospitalizations now reflect cases from at least two weeks ago. Nothing that's happened in the previous two weeks would have slowed spread. This sets a very high baseline for us at the current moment. \n3. Precautions among people and businesses continue to loosen. \n4. Texan governmental response will be extremely slow. At this point it is extremely politically difficult for the Texas government to admit that COVID is becoming problematic in the state, and to impose restrictions designed to slow it. This will mean both of those steps are heavily delayed. \n5. Public response will be extremely slow. Political and personal capital for restrictions was already mostly spent in the initial lockdown, and anti- distancing/mask wearing beliefs are now becoming deeply held partisan positions for a large portion of the population.  All of these factors will build off of each other, which should create a situation of relatively unchecked growth in cases from two weeks ago until some point at least a week or two from now, followed by largely piecemeal and ineffective efforts at containment that will may slow growth but likely won't stop it for at least another several weeks.  I think most people are forecasting Texas as though it is part of a \"second phase\" of the virus spread, when in fact I think the more accurate perspective is that it is going through the \"first phase\" that the coasts went through, but delayed by several months. In this case I use NY as my comparison. Conditions in Texas are less favorable for completely unchecked spread, but conditions for limiting the spread when it becomes an obvious problem are also much less favorable, and the population of Texas is much larger. So, slower growth but over a much longer period of time, and while NY topped out at 18k hospitalizations, this forecast only tops out at 10k.

Back-check on 30 June 2020, if the likely case then will be the worst case as of above. Then certainly the range of \"Between 2,500 and 5,000, inclusive\" will not hold and I'll shift most of the weight to the third range. The duration of a hospitalization is critically depending on the h. and support with oxygen etc. happening at the earliest stage possible, and how experienced the ICU team has been being confronted with COVID 19-typical inflammatory systemic and respiratory issues. Both determinants should improve for Texas over the next few months, which will lower the individual duration of hospitalization from an average of 30 days to 24 days (?) before August, however at a large span width of between 8 to 60 days.\nInfected people who have been hospitalized in April and May (and now occupy an estimated share of 50% of statewide ICU beds) will be treated with advanced methods to alleviate recovery on the one hand, so 25% this group will be released from hospital by 26 June 2020.\nAt the same time, the outlook for a recovery gets more slim the longer the hospitalization lasts, so an estimated increased percentage of 25% of the group (\"Infected people who have been hospitalized in April and May\") will have suffered a lethal outcome (i.e. will have died from COVID 2019) by 26 June 2020, compared to their likelihood of 20% for lethality when they first entered the ICU. In the conclusion to this, I expect 25% of the current patients in ICU in Texas to leave the hospital and to free their bed one way or another before 26 June 2020. These are of course core assumptions for the \"net rate of hospitalization\" and the speed, at which hospital capacities in Texas will be occupied. EDIT1: As of today 17 June 2020, they're way ahead of the \"schedule\"...\nEDIT 2: As of 18 June 2020: three days ahead of the model, however not completely robust and significant yet due to extra cases from TDCJ. More revisions and lagged cases reported late likely ahead, but when? More revisions of forecast to come. Could turn out very painful for Texas. Obesity is indeed one of the key drivers of an infection turning inflammatory (and being hospitalized finally), so an above average hospitalization rate must be expected and is my major concern now. Current hospitalization tends to be between 1.5% and 3.5% of cumulative positives, cumulative hostpitalization is in a wider range between 7% and 15% (with a Median of estimated 12.5% of cumulative cases, statewide. As Texas is still in the early stages of their outbreak, \"current hospitalization\" is likely more relevant.\nEstimating an undetected number of 40,000 cases and a resulting rate of 3.0% \"current h.\", reaching a number of 4,200 cases in hospitals in the next two weeks would be no surprise."], [88098, "2020-06-16T09:47:13Z", [0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], "As of June 15th- 2326 hospitalizations and trending up.

Using NY and NJ for guidance data points, I'll start by using NJ as the high end, as it is in the right range of case load. NJ has about 10x the population density, though, which may have an effect of how quick the growth is and where the highest total will get to. Current hospitalizations in TX are at 2,242 for today [5]. Based on current trends, and the fact the gov is not halting reopening [6], this is only going to get bigger, though some local areas are giving travel advisories and testing guidance to those who travel to the bigger cities [7], so that may stem the spread to avoid the NJ in April case level. I'll consider 2.5 -5k the low end estimate, and put most of my bet in the middle bin for now.

There is not the kind of explosion of new cases that was seen in New York. \nPopulation and density of Texas: 29 million at 110/square mile. Population of New York State: 19,5 million at 421/square mile. While Texas has a higher population it is also more spread out. If at one time Dallas is hit hard, Houston might be pretty unaffected and vice versa. The peak of the number of hospitalized patients because of Covid-19 in New York was 18 825 patients. The quick spread in New York largely happened before restrictions of any kind was put in place or awareness among people of the risks. Trend is upwards and I would be very surprised if it doesn't pass 2 500 cases. The warm summer, possibility of peaks being at dates several weeks apart and quite slow trend upwards makes me put most faith in a number between 2 500 - 5 000.
