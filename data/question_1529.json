As such, there is the very real possibility that we are on the \"brink of a pandemic\" [3]. Moreover, a new analysis out today by a infectious disease modelling team at Imperial College London has estimated that \"two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide\" - so the situation outside of China is probably worse than is being reported. I am thus revising my estimate upward as to the likelihood of a PHEIC declaration remaining in effect on May 6.

Three of these questions might be answered and affirmed: the event is unusual in terms of the long incubation period of the virus in humans. If there is confirmation that patients without syntoms and without being ill spread the virus, then possibly this issue will be considered as unexpected or unusual. There is significant risk of international spread as result of long incubation period where carriers are not aware of their spread level. In 52 days, 26 countries have been infected already, so the rate of infection is faster than previous pandemics like Swine flu in 2009. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t show a high rate of mortality. There is significant risk of international travel and trade restrictions as the virus spreads rapidly, then countries are imposing travel restrictions. Because China has imposed internal bans, then factories are not producing, and has impact on international trade. Nevertheless, this issue does not constitute a trade restriction directly but might have an impact on trade in terms of decrease of products offer, hence, there might be a price increase for customers. \n2)Autumn in the South hemisphere is about to start, and this might lead to addition of newly infected countries. Some of these countries are not prepared with resources to fight against a massive spread of the virus, for example, some countries in Asia (Iran), South America and Africa with inadequate or unprepared health services.\n3)As the increase of infected people is faster than in other pandemics, then production of medicines might not be able to cope with a high demand. For this reason, developed countries might also not be able to provide support to poor countries as they will give priority to their own citizens. Also, politicians might use the pandemic as a leverage tool for achieving gains in negotiations with China.\n4)Despite the competition amogst differnt research centres, the development of a vaccine against the virus is expected for 2021, longer than in other pandemics.

And third phase for testing different dosis in order to find the appropriate formulae for increasing effectiveness in humans will continue before commercialisation.

Outside view\nOf the five PHEIC declared previously, the shortest duration was 8.5 months (for Zika virus). Two (polio and Ebola) are still in effect. It seems that WHO may be conservative about declaring a PHEIC, partly for political considerations, but once it is declared it is likely to stay in effect until WHO has a high level of assurance that the disease is under control. Inside view\nIn this case, there is a high degree of uncertainty about the likely spread of the disease, partly due to the long incubation period which means more people being unknowingly infected and therefore continuing to infect others (https://hubbardresearch.com/estimating-infections-2019-coronavirus-underreporting/). There are already sizable numbers of reported infections elsewhere in Asia (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/publichealth/84698) which imply larger numbers of people unknowingly infected.

There is significant risk of international spread as result of long incubation period where carriers are not aware of their spread level. In 52 days, 26 countries have been infected already, so the rate of infection is faster than previous pandemics like Swine flu in 2009. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t show a high rate of mortality. There is significant risk of international travel and trade restrictions as the virus spreads rapidly, then countries are imposing travel restrictions. Because China has imposed internal bans, then factories are not producing, and has impact on international trade. Nevertheless, this issue does not constitute a trade restriction directly but might have an impact on trade in terms of decrease of products offer, hence, there might be a price increase for customers.\n2)Autumn in the South hemisphere is about to start, and this might lead to addition of newly infected countries. Some of these countries are not prepared with resources to fight against a massive spread of the virus, for example, some countries in South America and Africa with inadequate or unprepared health services.\n3)As the increase of infected people is faster than in other pandemics, then production of medicines might not be able to cope with a high demand. For this reason, developed countries might also not be able to provide support to poor countries as they will give priority to their own citizens. Also, politicians might use the pandemic as a leverage tool for achieving gains in negotiations with China.\n4)The development of a vaccine against the virus is expected for 2021, longer than in other pandemics.\n5)China is also trying to avoid the media storm while in trade negotiations with the US, and therefore, might also be providing innacurate data, which eventually will come to the light.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Emergency_of_International_Concern\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/health/24flu.html\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7995583/How-killer-coronavirus-compares-SARS-swine-flu-Ebola-Interactive-map.html\nhttps://larepublica.pe/economia/2020/02/14/coronavirus-afecta-primera-fase-del-acuerdo-comercial-entre-china-y-estados-unidos/\nhttps://larepublica.pe/mundo/2020/02/13/coronavirus-aliexpress-cancelo-pedidos-a-espana-por-el-covid-19-enfermedad-oms-fotos/\nhttps://larepublica.pe/sociedad/2020/02/11/coronavirus-peru-se-descarta-presencia-de-virus-y-se-activan-protocolos/\nhttps://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20200215/473557546877/coronavirus-wuhan-casos-fallecidos-sintomas-china-espana-mwc-2020-barcelona-gsma-ultimas-noticias-hoy-en-directo.html"], [1646, "2020-02-15T21:22:27Z", [0.9], ""], [79464, "2020-02-15T20:43:40Z", [0.7], ""], [72737, "2020-02-15T20:36:52Z", [0.85], ""], [81321, "2020-02-15T20:25:13Z", [0.5], ""], [47396, "2020-02-15T20:13:16Z", [0.95], "China may hide cases with their draconian control, but  India is loose on the world, and will need to run its course."], [1333, "2020-02-15T19:47:37Z", [0.96], ""], [84709, "2020-02-15T19:45:17Z", [0.75], "While the season will be coming to an end the long duration of the illness the incubation period and the strain that it will have put on healthcare resources it is highly likely that the pheic will remain in place"], [529, "2020-02-15T19:17:20Z", [0.76], "Some background: There have now been five PHEIC's declared by the WHO, starting with Swine flu in 2009. (https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-what-other-public-health-emergencies-has-the-who-declared)  At least superficially, Swine flu might be the 'closest' in (general) similarity of the others to the current Coronavirus outbreak/declaration.  It appears that the WHO ended its declaration for Swine flu approximately 15 months after it was initiated. As another past example, the WHO reportedly ended its PHEIC for Ebola (2014) about 22 months after declaring one. (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/last-week-world-health-organization-declared-coronavirus-global-health-emergency-what-does-mean-180974128/) Medical experts are currently (still) working to completely understand important aspects of the Coronavirus, including exactly how it spreads, etc. (https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/11/hospitals-governments-need-more-data-to-prepare-for-the-new-coronavirus-outbreak/). \nAn effective, tested vaccine is likely several or more months away. (https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/12/804628081/timetable-for-a-vaccine-against-the-new-coronavirus-maybe-this-fall).

So at that time, while media coverage may wane or change it\u2019s tone to be more moderate, that is largely divorces from the epidemiological facts on the ground.  The definition taken from Wikipedia (and verified on the official website of the World Health Organization) is as follows:\nA Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\", formulated when a situation arises that is \"serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected\", which \"carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border\" and \"may require immediate international action\".  As a poor example, the h1n1 swine flu pandemic of which began appearing in April of 2009 met the criteria as a PHEIC and can serve to illustrate the decision making around these declarations. The 2009 swine flu pandemic remained in effect until August 10, 2010. This was only taken out of effect when it was clear that out-of-season transmission had largely stopped, the intensity of transmissions were dropping when defined periods were compared, and there were signs that this strain of influenza was becoming established as a seasonal strain.

It\u2019s obviously wrong that Singapore has virtually the same number as Hong Kong when Hong Kong has an active, open border with China. Clearly, Hong Kong is under-counting infections for political or capacity reasons. Similarly, Western Europe has reported 43 infections, while the US has reported 13. America\u2019s numbers seem low given Western Europe\u2019s comparable population to the US while the US has a greater number of Chinese nationals to boot. Why is the US infection rate relatively low?  All of this becomes more striking in light of comments on February 11th from Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas on CNBC, \u201cFrom when the virus began incubating in mid-November until now, there may have been a million and a half arrivals from China to the United States.\u201d Lastly, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote in a CNBC Op-Ed on February 10th \u201cModels suggest that for every person who traveled into the U.S. infected with corona-virus, and who was successfully diagnosed and quarantined, maybe three more arrived undetected.\u201d  CDC Corona-virus Testing Process is Slow and Bureaucratic An expert on virus testing that I queried stated that CDC requires corona-virus samples to be sent to state health departments and then on to CDC for testing. This is a slow process that seems outdated when local testing kits can be had for $2 a pop. Mayor Bill DeBlasio is pushing to get the tests out to New York as is Senator Cotton to all 50 states. People Are Careful When Risks Abound A Harvard epidemiologist pointed out that social responses to an epidemic only occur when there are reported cases. Any lack of news about confirmed cases when an infectious disease is prevalent means that people won\u2019t take reasonable precautions.  Trump Obfuscated Troop Injuries in Iraq President Trump suppressed reports of injuries to troops from the Iranian missile attack on US bases in Iraq this past January. He initially tweeted that nobody was hurt. Later, reports emerged that 60 had suffered injuries which the President characterized as \u201cheadaches.\u201d The Guardian reported yesterday that over 100 troops had, in fact, suffered traumatic brain injuries \u2013 a substantial change from the President\u2019s initial claim. President Trump clearly withheld information to support his immediate political needs. Could President Trump also be delaying confirmed corona-virus infections announcements too? Trump\u2019s Incentives to Delay Facts: Impeachment and Election Given the impeachment vote last week and the current election year battles, the Trump Administration has substantial incentives to suppress bad news. Why? To protect the stock market and consumer confidence as both of which would immediately take a hit on virus news. Without a vaccine, \u201csocial distancing\u201d - keeping people apart - is the only way to slow down a virus. And the price for doing this is dramatically slowing down the economy which leads to lost revenue and people losing their jobs.  This is what is happening right now in China and Hong Kong. It is exactly what would cause President Trump to lose the election if it occurred here in America too. The President has substantial incentives to delay new infection reports. President Trump\u2019s reelection strategy is a huge bet on stimulus from cutting taxes, interest rates, and regulation to pump-up the stock market and the economy. If the \u201csugar high\u201d continues long enough, his gamble is that is that he will win the presidential election in November. Unfortunately, exogenous shocks like a pandemic are exactly what could sink his bet and lead him to losing, much like Super-storm Sandy saved President Obama\u2019s reelection bid in 2012. Ironic that a tiny virus can knock the President out of the White House. I often hear from many of President Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters that they dislike him personally but will vote for him if things are good. Therefore, his margin for error is quite limited should the economy start to turn down. Is Trump Repeating China\u2019s Mistake? Under the pretext of preventing a panic, there is the possibility that President Trump is influencing the CDC\u2019s control of the testing process to determine when infections are announced, if at all.  He might be hoping that it all just goes away. China did exactly this. The authorities in Wuhan sent information to their higher-ups in Beijing who sat on the results.  So, if President Trump is making the same mistake \u2013 the result could be catastrophic too if the disease is spreading. And the really big variable which we don\u2019t know yet is if there are \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d like the British national who visited Singapore and infected people in France, Spain, and the UK. The CDC designates 68 cases as \u201cPending\u201d meaning \u201cspecimens received and awaiting testing, as well as specimens in route to CDC,\u201d so there is plenty of room for President Trump to suddenly bump the number up to 82.  One Million Students Left Wuhan, China\u2019s Biggest College Town While it is well known that 5 million people left Wuhan before the quarantine commenced on January 23rd, what is less well known, as I was personally told by a Chinese academic, is that Wuhan is China\u2019s biggest college town and that 1 million students left Wuhan before the lock down. What if the transmission speed in Wuhan is linked to the large student population as students are a highly social demographic?  As America\u2019s winter break this year coincided with China\u2019s Lunar New Year, it\u2019s probable that an above-average number of Chinese students went home and returned for the start of spring term. America has 360,000 Chinese university students, more than any other country, and at least 15,000 are in Boston. Could Boston be the Next Wuhan? As America\u2019s biggest college town, Boston has a large student population like Wuhan with a freshly returned population of students from China over the past few weeks \u2013 the ingredients exist for an outbreak in Boston. There is currently no public health warning in Boston and the hospitals are not operating at a heightened level of risk mitigation."], [64876, "2020-02-15T05:12:31Z", [0.75], ""], [29899, "2020-02-15T04:34:26Z", [0.5], ""], [74077, "2020-02-15T04:12:02Z", [0.6], ""], [31275, "2020-02-15T03:01:52Z", [0.17], "While it is still going up 2-3000 a day in China for those diagnosed with Coronavirus I do not see an explosion of cases elsewhere.

While cases in China may still be significant by the end of April, it appears that outside of China it will be well and truly under control.
