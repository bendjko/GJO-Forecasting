See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 (also see that comment for ambiguity regarding \"mass killing campaign\") Other judgments:\n- EWP itself estimates 5.4%. [1]\n- crowd forecast here is 1%. Inside view:\n- \"Burma/Myanmar has two ongoing mass killings: we assess a state-led mass killing against minority populations in the country\u2019s east to be ongoing since 1948 and a state-led mass killing targeting the Rohingya beginning in 2016. \" [1] It's not clear what other mass killings there can be. Reprisals by the Rohingya against the government would likely not count since security forces are not civilian. I'm only aware of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, and they only caused 1 civilian casualty last year that was likely unintended. [2] I find an increase extremely unlikely. Other ethnic groups have recently joined forces, making such conflicts increasingly unlikely as well. [3] Overall judgment:\n- EWP seems too high due to the weird situation in Myanmar.\n- There just doesn't seem to be a lot of ways for Myanmar to get even worse. \n- 1% seems right to capture unknown unknowns.
