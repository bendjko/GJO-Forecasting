Turkey has lost approximately four dozen soldiers since the start of its campaign in Syria in August.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences for the deaths in a call with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, saying the friendly fire incident was due to poor coordination, according to the Russian news agency RIA.\nRussian-backed Syrian regime forces are positioned along the southern outskirts of al-Bab, while Turkey and allied Syrian rebels have the northern and western suburbs under their control.\nThe incident poses a fresh challenge to the protracted campaign by various international forces against Islamic State in Syria.\nTurkey has focused on seizing al-Bab, while the U.S. wants to prioritize a campaign to seize the terror group\u2019s de-facto capital of Raqqa. However, Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies have been bogged down around the town since November after seizing a more than 60-mile-long belt of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border from Islamic State.\nThe terror group had used the border area as a link between its so-called caliphate and the outside world, helping it to reinforce its fighters and launch terror attacks in Turkey and Western Europe. Many Islamic State fighters who survived Turkey\u2019s incursions in that area have fallen back to al-Bab.\nMomentum in the battle shifted this week, as Turkey announced the capture of strategic hilltops in the al-Bab suburbs, due in part to an uptick of air support and strikes by U.S.-led coalition fighter planes. Turkish officials said their troops were ready to thrust toward the center of town.\nU.S. officials hope that Turkey will succeed in al-Bab and free up Ankara\u2019s Syrian rebel allies to help in the fight for Raqqa.\nThat operation has stalled in part due to Turkey\u2019s insistence that the Syrian Kurdish fighters known as the YPG be sidelined from the battle. The Pentagon sees YPG fighters as the most capable local forces, but Turkey views them as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S. and Europe.\nThat tension also complicated an agreement between Ankara and Washington about the U.S. support role in al-Bab, according to U.S. and Turkish officials, leaving space for Russia to improve military coordination with Turkey (para. 1-10).

It is the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.\nIslamic State is also being fought in a separate campaign by the Turkish army and Syrian rebel groups northeast of Aleppo, and on several fronts across Syria by the Syrian government backed by the Russian air force and Iranian-backed militia.\nJordan, part of the U.S.-led coalition, said it had conducted air strikes against Islamic State targets in southern Syria on Friday night, hitting an ammunition depot, a car bomb factory, and a barracks.\nIslamic State is fighting hard to preserve its Syria foothold as it loses ground in Iraq. It still holds swathes of Syrian territory, mostly in central and eastern Syria.\nA SDF commander told Reuters the forces had so far advanced a few kilometers (miles) in the latest phase, which aims to capture areas to the east of the city, including the highway linking it to Deir al-Zor province (para. 1-7).

The deepening ties threaten to marginalize the United States in the struggle to shape Syria\u2019s ultimate fate.\nThe air missions, which took place for about a week near the strategically important town of Al Bab, represent the Kremlin\u2019s first use of its military might to help the Turks in their fight against the militant group. The Russians seized an opening to try to build a military relationship with Turkey, a NATO member, as the United States has sought to keep the emphasis on taking Raqqa, the Islamic State\u2019s self-declared capital.\nThe Russian bombing is a remarkable turnabout from November 2015, when a Turkish F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Su-24 attack plane that had violated Turkey\u2019s airspace.\nRussia and Turkey had already been involved in a joint effort to establish a cease-fire in Syria \u2014 one that does not involve the United States. At the same time, ties between the United States and Turkey have come under growing strain as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has become increasingly alarmed about the Kurdish forces known as the Y.P.G. The United States has aligned itself with those forces to combat the Islamic State in Syria.\nSome analysts say Russia appears to have arrived at an accommodation in which the Turks are moving to establish a security zone in northern Syria to preclude Syrian Kurds from setting up an autonomous region. In return, the Turks appear to be backing off their efforts to unseat President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who, with Russian help, is strengthening his hold on the country\u2019s major cities to the south.\n\u201cThe Russian-Turkish rapprochement is largely tactical,\u201d said James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey. \u201cRussia can live for now with a Turkish enclave in northern Syria if it does not threaten the Assad regime. And it allows Russia to exploit the U.S. shift to Turkey\u2019s rival, the Y.P.G., by providing air support to the Turks against the Islamic State, which the U.S. inexplicably is not providing\u201d (para. 1-6).

NATO has been reluctant to commit to a no-fly zone, despite Turkey's repeated requests to NATO allies to establish one over Northern Syria. The international community also understands that establishing a no-fly zone will require support from the UNSC, which is highly unlikely given Russia's veto power. Trump has indicated that he does not support a no-fly zone. However, even if the Trump administration's security officials wanted to pursue a no-fly zone, Trump's comfortable relationship with Putin makes this policy option unlikely. Further, 1 April 2017 is just over 10 weeks after inauguration, and it is unlikely that any major policy on Syria will be achieved in that short time frame.  Militarily, it is questionable whether European powers have the capability to unilaterally impose a no-fly zone, which would be tantamount to an act of war against Russia and Syria. Both countries have active air power, and Russia would likely be unwilling to cease it's highly effective and brutal bombing campaign in response to a no-fly zone, risking serious armed conflict between militaries in Syria. Establishing a no-fly zone would also require neutralising Syria's air-defence systems, a difficult prospect given Russia's S-300 ground-to-air defence system which is deployed in Syria.  Even if European powers have that capability, their priorities are elsewhere at the moment with upcoming elections, a fast-paced terror threat, refugee flows, and Russia's growing global presence. Merkel stated late last year that a no-fly zone was an unlikely option.

The group seized the city in 2014, partially destroying a number of its world-renowned archaeological sites.\nThe recent militant offensive drove Syrian government troops almost completely from the city on Sunday. The Islamic State-linked news agency Amaq later posted images of Syrian and Russian equipment left behind by the retreating troops. One video shows the remains of a Russian forward operating base that had been established after the city was first retaken in March and was used to help with demining efforts there (para. 1-3).

With aircraft and advisers deployed around Syria, Russia has warned Turkey against advancing more than 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) into Syria, said the second U.S. official. For now, the Turkey-backed force has stopped short of al Bab, which is about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border, U.S. officials said. Taking al Bab would expand a buffer zone that Turkey is establishing inside Syria to seal its border from Islamic State infiltration. Turkey's incursion also has prevented the YPG from unifying the northern Kurdish enclaves. Moreover, al Bab's fall to the Turkish-backed force would expand a potential Turkish-protected \"safe zone\" for moderate Syrian rebels, who could base their internationally recognized government-in-exile in the area. The rebels also could use such a zone to re-establish supply corridors from the Turkish border and open a new front aimed at relieving the Syrian regime's siege of opposition-held eastern Aleppo, experts said. \"An eventual reopening of the Aleppo city front is an inevitability,\" said Charles Lister, an expert with the Middle East Institute in Washington. \"The opposition will go whether the Turks want it or not.\" (para. 20-25).

The Russian military says it has beefed up its forces in Syria with state-of-the-art air defense missiles, a move that follows Washington's suspension of contacts with Russia over Syria. The Defense Ministry said Tuesday that a battery of the S-300 air defense missile systems has been deployed to Syria to protect a Russian navy facility in the Syrian port of Tartus and Russian navy ships in the area. The deployment will add punch to the Russian military force in Syria, which has long-range S-400 missile defense systems and an array of other surface-to-air missiles at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia (para 1-4).

I assume any no-fly zone would be to protect civilians in areas where not much fighting is taking place. Turkey has been interested in the area along its border with Syria. The West has been most concerned about the bombing in Aleppo, but by late January it could be too late to help with a no-fly zone there. The US public would not want to create a no-fly zone over IS territory. Russia would resist one being set up in north-west Syria. So the only likely areas would be over territory controlled by Turkey (which Turkey could do itself) or over territory controlled by the Kurds, which could set Turkey and the US at odds.
