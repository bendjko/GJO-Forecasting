That makes sense; someone dies today, but it takes a few days for the tests results to come back saying they died of coronavirus. But the result is that the number of daily deaths recorded at CVT [2] is now completely wrong. For instance, the number of deaths on 20, 21, 22 April are 696, 735, 769 according to the official Ohio dashboard, but they are recorded as 509, 557, 610 at CVT.

There is some chance that we will not reach the 14 states in the remaining 10 days (which would be good news) and that is the reason I have not said 100% more than 13.

As we approach the end of the month, One thing I should draw attention to is the delay in publication of deaths. From \"More Info\" tab, you can see that 1 May data will be released on May 4th, so a 3 day lag. Hence As i view the data now on April 20th, There is actually 13 days of deaths remaining, not 10. This will become extremely important as we approach the completion date.  Early on there was also lots of deaths that were not classified as Covid-19 related because they were not tested. As we are still seeing a ramp up of testing availability, as well as more awareness of testing deceased persons. There is also a huge blowup in European news this week about the full extent of carehome deaths and how they are not being tested or reported. This may well filter into US thinking in the coming 2 weeks, and I believe this is a possible tailwind to the death total entering the last 2 weeks of April. Here are my thoughts from April 20th: 9 are over 1000  Florida is 773 and doubling every 10 days. Even with a steep decceleration, they will pass 1000. for me this is very near 100%, so 10 are 99% chance for me personally.  Washington and Wisconsin now appears near 0% chance, which leaves 17 states (10/17) For remaining 7 states important metrics are deaths, doubling rate, but also date of lockdown, to estimate seeded infections. From looking at European data, daily deaths seem to peak 3-4 weeks after full lockdown. The extreme lag time in my opinion is the infections from the day before lockdown proceeding to infect the rest of household over the following week. Maryland: 486 deaths, current doubling every 7 days. large gatherings restricted March 16th. Full lockdown March 30th, exactly 3 weeks ago, so i will assume Maryland is approaching peak daily deaths. Even making April 20th the daily peak has the death total surpassing 1000 by May 4th data, so this for me is, conservatively, a 90% chance. Georgia: 682 deaths, current doubling every 11 days. \"shelter in place\" order implemented April 3rd. A relatively late lockdown date conflicts with a long doubling time. I believe this would be close if not for the total deaths already being fairly high, at nearly 700. Deaths becoming apparent in the next few days will have been seeded before lockdown, meaning i doubt we are past the daily peak ( contrary to the data i know). For these reasons i believe georgia to be ~95% to pass 1000 deaths by May 4th data. Ohio: 471 deaths doubling every 8 days. bars and eateries closed March 15th, shelter in place March 22nd. A very early lockdown date, conflicted by a steep death rate. I believe this early Lockdown means we are already at peak daily deaths in the state, and could see this metric fall swiftly. That being said, it is unlikely to deccelerate fast enough, given the 13 days that are left. I have this at 80% chance. Indiana: 562 deaths doubling every 9 days. schools, bars and restaurants closed March 16th, shelter in place order March 24th. Another early lockdown date, Meaning we should be at or past peak daily deaths. This is extremely close to call, a classic \"50/50\" for me. Texas: 503 deaths doubling every 9 days. a \"patchwork\" of local regulations, making this hard to work out. anything but a total state lockdown means a serious exponential acceleration could appear anywhere in the state however, which adjusts the probability a lot. This coupled with state protests arguing for a reopening (shows public sentiment and therefore will to abide by lockdown rules) means unfortunately I think we will see some serious numbers out of Texas, and I believe it to be 80% chance to reach 1000 deaths by May 4th data.  Virginia: 277 deaths doubling every 6 days. Shelter in place March 30th. We should be at the peak daily deaths, but the doubling time is still virulent, makes Virginia a possible, despite its small death total.It would have to double twice, at current doubling time that would take 11 days, however the acceleration SHOULD be slowing as we are 3-4 weeks from lockdown date. Another tough one to call, 35% for me currently but this probability will be all over the place on a daily basis as new data emerges. Colorado: 421 deaths doubling every 13 days. bars and restaurants closed March 1st, Schools March 18th, stay at home order March 26th. Early closure dates across the board, already a very slow doubling time, and should deccelerate further. At current doubling rate Colorado would fall just under 1000 deaths in 14 days, and rate should be deccelerating. The only way it can go over is if a cluster of deaths at a carehome or prison emerge, or some large unseen factor that we cannot predict. I give Colorado a 5% chance.

If the current trends continue; Pennsylvania, Florida, and Georgia will all pass 1000 deaths. However, it will not be a linear curve. The future results will depend upon a variety of factors. The most important one is - which section of the curve each state is at.  The average time it took states which have already passed 1000 deaths to get from 600 to 1000 deaths was around 5.5 days (not including New York). They also took an average of around 7.5 days to get from 200 to 600 deaths (again not including New York).  Pennsylvania is the only \u2018high risk\u2019 state which took less than 7.5 days to get from 200 deaths to 600 deaths\u2026 Pennsylvania - 7 days\nFlorida - 11 days \nGeorgia - 12 days \nIndiana - 10 days since 200, still 55 away\nMaryland - 7 days since 200, still 137 away\nTexas - 9 days since 200, still 147 away \nOhio - 10 days since 200, still 149 away\nWashington - 20 days\nColorado - 9 days since 200, still 209 away From 600, It took Pennsylvania 3 days to reach 800 deaths. It\u2019s going to take Florida 1 or 2 more days to reach 800 deaths, 4 or 5 days in total. From this, I\u2019m relatively confident that Pennsylvania and Florida will reach 1000 deaths before may the 1st. This brings the total to 10 states. If Georgia continues at its 10-day average, it will go from 600 to 800 deaths in 6 or 7 days total. Therefore, it may reach 800 deaths in 4 or 5 days. If Georgia follows a similar curve to other states, it should reach 1000 deaths sooner than the 1st of May.  If Indiana continues at its 10-day average, it will reach 800 deaths in around 7 to 8 more days. However this will probably happen sooner, just pushing it over the 1000 mark if it follows the curve.  Maryland could reach 1000 deaths if its average rate increases. Again, following the likely curve, I believe there is a 45% chance of this happening.  Washington seems to be a wildcard, extremely difficult to judge without more data. With the information we have I don\u2019t think it will reach 1000 deaths.  All the other states will probably not reach 1000 deaths by May the 1st either, bringing the total to 12. However, Close attention to each one is needed.  For each state to reach 1000 deaths there average per day needs to be: Pennsylvania - 13.7\nFlorida - 20.5\nGeorgia - 27.3\nIndiana - 37.9\nMaryland - 44.8\nTexas - 45.6\nOhio - 45.8\nWashington - 33.1\nColorado - 50.8 Criticism is very welcome!"], [87688, "2020-04-19T21:26:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.48, 0.42], ""], [87688, "2020-04-19T21:21:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.85], ""], [70617, "2020-04-19T20:50:28Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7], ""], [86910, "2020-04-19T20:34:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.05], "9 states are over 1,000 deaths, in the 12 days that are left to the 1st May, Florida, Georgia and Washington are very likely to go over that toll, making 12 states.

Not sure what the discrepancy is. In any case, 8 states are guaranteed: CA, CT, IL, LA, MA, MI, NJ, NY. I think 3 states are almost guaranteed: FL, GA, PA. And the following states are still in question: CO, IN, MD, OH, TX, WA. For each of the latter 9 states, I looked at what % daily growth they need to break 1,000; and average % daily growth in the past week, and whether it's going down. Based on that I assigned rough odds of each state breaking 1,000. The results are: FL: needs 2.2%, average 9.5%, not going down. 95% to break 1,000\nGA: needs 2.9%, average 7.0%, not going down. 85% to break 1,000\nPA: needs 2.0%, average 8.9%, not going down. 95% to break 1,000\nCO: needs 6.9%, average 6.6%, not going down. 50% to break 1,000\nIN: needs 4.8%, average 8.1%, not going down. 70% to break 1,000\nMD: needs 6.3%, average 13.9%, not going down. 70% to break 1,000\nOH: needs 6.4%, average 8.8%, kinda going down. 50% to break 1,000\nTX: needs 6.3%, average 9.6%, not going down. 60% to break 1,000\nWA: needs 3.7%, average 4.4%, not going down. 50% to break 1,000 To aggregate these 9 probabilities I assume they are independent and run the code at the end of this post.

Also, average ICU length of stay is around 2-3 weeks.\n2) For states that don't report vent stats, I estimated that the ICU mortality would be slightly lower (50%) since hospitals in most states are still below capacity and may still accept non-intubated patients in their ICUs.\n3) For states that did not report ICU or vent stats, I estimated that the overall hospital mortality rate would be 10%, since these patients are moderately-severely ill.\nUsing this algorithm, I identified an additional 3 states likely to exceed 1000 deaths:\nCA (1393-1674)\nCT (1164)\nPA (958-1180)\nTherefore, I am very confident that 9 states will exceed 1000 deaths within 14 days. \nThere remains a small possibility that localized outbreaks may develop.

So that rules out the bottom bucket. There are 7 other states between 500 and 1000: Connecticut, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Washington. I consider it basically a sure thing that the number of deaths in every state will more than double in two weeks. The exception may be states that have been facing the crisis for longer and thus have had time to learn how serious it is, and act. As far as I know, among the 7 this is CA and WA. However, CA is at 821 and there's no way we don't go over 1,000 in 16 days. But WA is at 541 and the daily increase has been around 3.5%-4.5% daily for the past ~10 days [1]. WA is not great at publishing data (there are several days with \"no deaths\" and then a day with lots of deaths) but if you interpolate it it's remarkably consistent in the last 10 days at 3.5%-4.5%. At 4% daily increase (midpoint) starting from 541, we reach 1,013 on 1 May 2020. So to be conservative let's discard WA for now. Still that leaves us with 6 more states reaching 1,000.  So that puts us at 11, ruling out all but the top 2 buckets. I just looked at the crowd forecast and top two buckets are 38% combined. What?? Anyway, let's look at the other side. To be conservative, let's say no state has deaths growing at > 10% / day. That means any state with less than 217 deaths now, is not gonna reach 1,000. That rules out 34 of the 51 states. This is actually a robust calculation since there is a clean break around there: Virginia has 195, and the next one up is Colorado at 329, a lot higher. So Virginia and below need ~11%/day sustained growth to reach 1,000, whereas Colorado and above need ~7%. That leaves 5 states in play: Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Texas. Let's bring Washington back as it was on the fence. For a naive calculation let's say each has 50% independent chance to go over 1,000. What are the odds that 3 or more do? From elementary probability we know this is 42/64 ~ 66%. Now my big weakness is I am total crap at US geography. I have NO IDEA if these states are close to each other or correlated in some other way. And if I haven't learned US geography in the 10+ years I've lived here, I certainly won't start now. So I should de-extremize to 40/60 or something. On the other hand I shoved 34 states under the carpet over the 11%/day growth thing, and in the early stages of the pandemic you definitely see >20% rates of growth. So let's keep it at 34/66. @Anneinak @Datawick @JMR2017 [1] https://covidtracking.com/data/state/washington"], [86796, "2020-04-15T23:54:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [87545, "2020-04-15T23:43:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [14027, "2020-04-15T23:30:45Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.59, 0.37, 0.02], "Just looked at the most recent data, and found that I was probably in the weeds with my 22% chance of 5-7 states.\nAdding to the current total the average number of deaths over the past five days times the 15 days remaining gives the following projections: Already over 1000 -- NY, NJ, MI, LA\nProjected to reach 1000 -- CA, CT, FL, IL, MA, PA\nProjected to reach 750 to 960 -- GA, IN, MD, OH, TX, WA If the trend holds the answer will be 10.

Indiana is only at 436 deaths, but has had 49 new deaths according to The COVID Tracking Project (arbiter of the challenge, see above link).  Indiana also has 721 in the ICU according to <https://covidtracking.com/data&gt;. Maryland and Ohio are at 349 and 361, with 47 and 37 recent deaths, respectively.  They could have 1000 by May 1.
