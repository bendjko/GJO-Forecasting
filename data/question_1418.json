Chile\u2019s government already has a bill in congress, which establishes a complementary public scheme and also gets employers to start contributing to the savings pots of workers.  \u201cThe process should not stop,\u201d said Pablo Antolin, principal economist at the private pension unit of the OECD financial affairs division. Citing demographic and economic pressures, he said workers needed to save more and for longer, and that fee and commission structures needed to be analyzed. However, citing the example of Chile, he said lawmakers may need to reconsider how any new rules that involve introducing employer contributions are implemented, suggesting they could be phased in first in sectors of the economy that are more resilient to the COVID-19 fallout. Chile\u2019s labor minister, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Zald\u00edvar, recently said the government was open to changing how employer contributions are phased in, local paper Diario Financiero reported.  . . .  Meanwhile, Antolin [ principal economist at the private pension unit of the OECD financial affairs division] .. .  urged authorities to carefully consider the possible negative long-term consequences of pension freedom and contribution holiday measures. Such policies could reduce the size of the pension that workers receive on retirement. Antolin said countries with the requisite fiscal clout should explore alternatives such as subsidies. Easing investment rules \u2013 such as Chile\u2019s move to allow funds to invest more in alternative assets \u2013 is another option as long as the risks are fully analyzed, he said. Pulling out funds now, following the recent plunge in financial asset value, could compound the impact on savers. \u201cAccess to retirement savings has to be the last resort and must be based on exceptional and personal circumstances,\u201d Antolin said in a presentation. \u201cAccessing savings will lead to a materialization of losses, fund liquidity and investment problems and, above all, a potential pension sufficiency problem on retirement.\u201d Opposition lawmakers in Chile have said members of private pension funds should be allowed access to some of their savings to help them weather the crisis.  . . .

It is difficult to see this happen in a center-right government.   While there are talks of having \"employers to pick up the tab for an additional 4 percent contribution to each of their workers\u00b4 pension funds, to be phased in and managed by an administrator of the employee\u00b4s choosing\" (1), they do not constitute nationalization.

The parties announced that the government will hold a plebiscite in April of next year, in which Chileans will be asked whether they want a new constitution. Those who do will also be able to indicate whether they think it should be written by a constitutional convention made up of members of Congress and private citizens chosen in local elections or one of elected citizens alone. If approved, citizens will then elect the members of the convention in October, which will have nine to twelve months to draft the new text.
