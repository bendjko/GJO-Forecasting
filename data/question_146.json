This can be used to generate a rough baseline of a 42% chance Brent would be below $20 (2014) in any given year.  In the last 43 years this has only occurred during one year (or a 2.3% chance).  Based solely on the historical trend I would give a 20% chance that the price of Brent will dip below $20 this year. On 28 Feb the spot price of a barrel of Brent was just under $32.  To fall below $20 would require a fall of 25% per month over the next two months.  According to indexmundi.com this kind of cumulative fall has only occurred once (Oct 2008-Dec 2008) since 1991 (as far back as it's records go).  This would suggest that despite the large recent falls in price, historically the price of Brent rallies, at least for a time.  While the price of Brent may well continue it's fall, and indeed dip below $20, based on previous trends it is very unlikely to be before 1 May 2016. Current commentary is suggesting a fall in supply of oil is almost certain to not occur in the two months, especially as Iran ramps up production now that sanctions against it are being slackened.  This may well already to \"priced in\" to the current price of Brent, meaning that something else will be required to push the price down by 40% in the next two months.  In a 24 Feb article in \"The Week\", the Saudi Oil Minister was quoted as having said at a conference that the KSA could live with oil as low as $20, even if it did not want to.  $20 then is a publicly stated floor for the largest oil producing nation.  This does not mean the price will not dip below it, but perhaps indicates a point below which action would be taken by the KSA, and may also provide reassurance to the market. The above analysis is predicated on a number of assumptions, which would require further investigation in order to come to a more certain judgement, but for the moment it does appear that the likelihood of a dip in the price of Brent below $20 is at the lower end of the 2%-42% scale for 2016, and even lower for the 1 May timeline.

Before that time it was the Texas Railroad Commission that regulated the price.  Since then the price has moved in long cycles, depending on investment levels and on supply and demand cycles.  The last time crude exceeded $100/brl (2008) it subsequently dropped sharply.  Recently (~2011 to 2014) the price exceeded $100 for a sustained period of time.  The high price financed the shale boom in North America.  The higher the price, and the longer the duration of the high price, the more severe the correction that we should expect. Today it seems that Saudi Arabia is sticking to it's plan to force high-cost producers out of business.  When the Saudis, together with a few other Gulf producers and Venezuela, said they had agreed to a production freeze at Jan 2016 levels, crude prices briefly increased.  The headline was that Saudi Arabia had \"blinked\" in the oil market battle.  Apparently they have since decided that was a bad idea, and they continue to produce at somewhere around 10 million barrels/day.  They have stated categorically that they will not cut production.  US refiners will be doing spring maintenance, and switching to summer blend gasoline very soon.  They won't need as much crude oil.  At the same time storage tanks are nearly full.  Prices may not go down as low as $20 -- the bottom may be reached at $25 or $22.  But the chances of sub-$20 oil are increasing.  If it happens it could happen quickly.

I'm frankly not convinced whether the continued uncertainty over the wars in Yemen and Syria may lead Saudi to double down or reverse its economic war against Iran through maintaining low oil prices. Therefore, for my initial forecast, I thought I'd start on the demand side. As a starting point I plotted daily Brent prices from FRED going back to 1989 and compared them to the dates of US recessions. While the data set is very limited, the average decline from peak to trough in Brent prices in the run-up and through a US recession is 60%. Using the Dec 2013 price level as the peak, Brent's recent sub-USD30 low reflects a 77% decline (slightly worse than the fall from July-December 2008). For prices to fall below USD20, this would imply ~83% decline from the Dec 2013 peak, which looking at strictly in terms of energy prices, would imply a slightly worse financial crisis than the GFC. Uncertainty over China's shift to lower-rate growth amid the rebalancing of its economy from investment to consumption-driven growth, makes that kind of scenario slightly more likely. I do think that if we get down to USD20 a barrel, a sharp rebound would be likely either by sparking a reversal in Saudi-led policy or a geopolitical risk spike triggered by a crisis of confidence in the ability of Saudi to maintain economic stability amid sustained pressure on its reserves. I'm putting the probability at 20% as my initial forecast. A weekly close above USD40 would lead me to drop this down sharply to 10%. If next week's close continues to stay above 35, I'd likely reduce more gradually towards 15%. A weekly close below USD30 would lead me to raise gradually toward 25%, and a close below USD25 would lead me to raise sharply to 40%+."], [20497, "2016-02-26T10:44:43Z", [0.03], ""], [20638, "2016-02-26T10:37:36Z", [0.1], "saudis cut production"], [20035, "2016-02-26T05:57:31Z", [0.2], ""], [6303, "2016-02-26T04:27:49Z", [0.02], "Brent crude oil prices are maintaining above $30 per barrel, but there is talk about further price drops and bankruptcies of the smaller fracking oil and gas companies in Texas.

Only if all producers agree to freeze production, otherwise some of the non-cooperative producers might benefit from maintaining production and charge better prices. Are these agreements likely to happen? Global trends point to 'yes', but the answer is not so simple. \nNothing is already signed, and Iran threatened to boost its production to 2.9 million bpd during this year. Prices were very high when Iran's sanctions were imposed, and they might seek some retaliation. But most importantly, top producer's cash cost remains well below $20 per barrel (< $8 ). There could be incentives to deviate. All in all my opinion is that oil prices won't fall below $20 in the short term. At least while the will to boost prices among global players persist.

It's understandable that Saudi Arabia may not regard Russia as the most reliable partner when it comes to voluntary supply cuts. But mutual suspicion runs like a fissure within OPEC itself, and thus the cartel's long history of busted production quotas and internecine warfare. Besides geopolitical and sectarian tensions, simple economics serve to divide OPEC. It would be a lot easier to agree on a common approach to influencing the global oil market if OPEC's members were all roughly equal in terms of income and financial strength -- but they are far from that. For example, while Saudi Arabia has a financial cushion to absorb the losses inflicted by its strategy of keeping output high, some of OPEC's have-nots (notably Venezuela), do not. Worse, there are wide differences in the oil price each government requires to balance their books. ~~~ Feb 17: \"Iran Balks at Committing to Capping Its Oil Production\" --> http://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-head-to-discuss-oil-output-cap-with-iran-iraq-venezuela-say-sources-1455697107 Iran dented the efforts of other big oil exporters to limit production Wednesday by refusing to curb its own output, demonstrating the limits of OPEC\u2019s power to boost prices amid rising tensions among its members. Iran\u2019s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh\u2019s decision threw into question the future of a plan brokered by Saudi Arabia and Russia this week for major oil producing countries to limit their output to last month\u2019s levels. The efforts come as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries scrambles to find ways to prop up an oil market rocked by surging production that outpaces demand by more than one million barrels on any given day. Prices have fallen by two-thirds since June 2014, throwing global markets into turmoil and ravaging OPEC countries like Venezuela and Nigeria and nonmember Russia. \u201cIran is saying, \u2018We are not playing with you,\u2019 \u201d said John Hall, chairman of the London consultancy Alfa Energy and a longtime observer of OPEC. \u201cIf Iran is working outside OPEC, the group cannot move. OPEC cannot do anything without Iran.\u201d The broken-down oil talks also added a new layer to the heightening tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, longtime rivals who are the Middle East\u2019s dominant powers for the Sunni and Shiite strains of Islam, respectively. Iran and Saudi Arabia are backing opposing sides on several battlefields, including Syria, where Iran supports President Bashar al-Assad and Saudi Arabia supports opposition groups who want to unseat him in the country\u2019s five-year war. Saudi Arabia is also leading a military coalition in Yemen fighting Shiite Houthi rebels whom Iran says it supports politically. ~~~ COMMENT: I also to echo @Khalid's sentiment --> \"Do I really want to forecast yet another market related IFP?

Production\nThe fear at the moment is that with the dropping of sanctions on Iran that the amount of global production will increase to the level that oil will fall below $20 a barrel. Yes, Iran is ramping up its production, but it won\u2019t be instantaneous. And at the same time Iran is increasing its production, wells in the United States are slowing down. As such the two should off-set each other.  Just recently, Russia and Saudi Arabia met about keeping their production levels at the same as January 2016 in an effort to maintain the oil price. (Russia\u2019s 2015 budget needed a $70 per barrel price to maintain; Saudi Arabia needed it to be at $100 per barrel. Both countries are now feeling the stress of the fall in oil prices.) The agreement, however, required that all parties maintain their January production levels. This won\u2019t happen. Iran needs to increase production while they can\u2014even if the price of oil is low. They missed out on the high prices and are hoping to cash in once the price rises again. Freezing their oil production would mean that they would have to ramp up only after prices had already risen. This would cause them to miss out on higher revenues.  But more than the agreement itself, this suggests that Saudi Arabia and Russia are at the point that they will need at least stable oil prices. World Economy\nHigh oil production in a rapidly growing economy will maintain or raise the price of oil. Slippage in the World GDP growth rate could mean an over-supply, which in turn can lower the price. A decision by oil producing countries to lower production might not help if the world economy slows beyond expectations. China\u2019s slowing economy and the rough ride the U.S. financial markets have had suggest that a slowing economy might be a consideration. Some economists are already talking about an approaching recession. Scared Investors\nEven the fear of a slowdown in China and the U.S., and the maintaining of current or rising production levels could run off commodity investors. Given that, we could have a sudden drop in the price of oil.

I see it as unlikely Brent drops all the way to $20, all it could take is 2 or 3 days of bad trading/fear in the markets to get it down there.   http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-russia-qatar-venezuela-agree-to-freeze-oil-output-at-januarys-levels-1455615900"], [19340, "2016-02-16T20:13:34Z", [0.0], ""], [15552, "2016-02-16T20:12:25Z", [0.01], "Low oil prices are lasting too long.
