A default would shut down PDVSA\u2019s credit lines from international banks, which it uses to finance oil production. Without the income from producing 2.7 million barrels of oil a day, the government wouldn\u2019t be able to service any of its debt, or pay for subsidies that support some of the poorest Venezuelans. PDVSA is the government\u2019s only source of foreign exchange. Compromising its standing would take away what\u2019s left of the political capital the government is using to cling to power. . . .  There\u2019s also speculation that the government has a vested interest in paying off the debt because some of it is owned by wealthy Venezuelans and is their means of accessing foreign currency.

In a surprise move this week, the cash-strapped country issued sovereign bonds for the first time in five years, to the tune of $5 billion. The deal dovetailed with a separate decision by the government to pledge a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo, its U.S. refinery subsidiary, as collateral for a loan from Rosneft, Russia's state-controlled energy company. The Citgo collateral deal is already being challenged in court by U.S. multinationals, The Wall Street Journal reported this week,\nRussia's contentious relationship with the U.S., combined with Venezuela's own long-standing antipathy toward the world's largest economy, could mean trouble if Venezuela fails to make good on its debts.

So why does it do it?  More than anything, the government is trying to secure the credibility of PDVSA, which is Venezuela\u2019s last lifeline for income. A default would shut down PDVSA\u2019s credit lines from international banks, which it uses to finance oil production. Without the income from producing 2.7 million barrels of oil a day, the government wouldn\u2019t be able to service any of its debt, or pay for subsidies that support some of the poorest Venezuelans. PDVSA is the government\u2019s only source of foreign exchange. Compromising its standing would take away what\u2019s left of the political capital the government is using to cling to power.  There\u2019s also speculation that the government has a vested interest in paying off the debt because some of it is owned by wealthy Venezuelans and is their means of accessing foreign currency. Dollar-denominated bonds \u201care an incredibly valuable asset\u201d for the political establishment, Dehn says. \"Next year, coupon and interest payments will average $100 million a month, S&P forecasts. But Venezuela\u2019s potential wealth is enormous in comparison to its debt. With more than 300 billion barrels of oil, it will benefit from the rebound in oil prices. At the end of the day, it is solvent. To end the crisis, though, there needs to be a drastic change in economic governance. Instead, the government is chaotically pulling the 100-bolivar note and, . . . it\u2019s issuing higher-denominated banknotes. It\u2019s also blaming private business, foreign governments, and the mafia for the crisis. \"S&P ratings analyst Manuel Orozco said that while Venezuela has an \u201cimpressive commitment\u201d to pay its debt, a default can still be expected. \"But Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro could still ride this out.

Calculating exact numbers for liquidity, however, is difficult. Consider the nation\u2019s gold reserves, for instance:\nDespite the liquidity problems, the government has not made use of its gold reserves (USD 7.7bn) in the past six months. Issues related to the quality of the gold and/or a reduction in the number of counterparts willing to operate with the country could have delayed the expected gold swaps and partly explain the current extremely tight cash position.\nThere is some light in the tunnel. Low debt service and potentially higher oil prices are expected to prevent further deterioration of the liquidity position early in 2017, Arreaza predicted. The assets the nation has at the ready still give it enough liquidity to offer \u201cthe possibility of muddling through 2017,\u201d but the communist nation is in a \u201cfragile\u201d situation with \u201clittle margin to maneuver.\u201d\nChina not looking to add to its Venezuela exposure (para. 1-5).

The market quickly saw it as a solvency issue, bond prices fell, Nicolas Maduro, the country's beleaguered president, threatened to sue J.P. Morgan for leaking the news about the missed due date.  What is to be expected, really? This is a CCC rated debt within a hair trigger alert of default. Yet, if anyone thinks that PdVSA will fold, they might as well believe that -- long term -- Venezuela becomes Cuba. Long-dated bonds will be around long after Maduro and his party are out of power.\nInvestors buying the long-dated PdVSA debt are betting on Maduro leaving office by 2018. A recall referendum is dead. He's not going anywhere and will serve out is term.  Investors buying PdVSA also believe Maduro will not let the country's only credible source of foreign, dollar denominated capital go belly up. If so, as one hedge fund manager told me, Maduro would be seen hanging from a lamp post in Caracas.\nWhat does that missed payment translate to?\nSiobhan Morden, Nomura's resident PdVSA guru, says one could argue logistical constraints such as Venezuela redirecting funds through offshore trusts in China. Venezuela had no problems paying on the PdVSA'21s, 2024s and 2026s. The selective delay on the 2035 was for $146 million in interest payments.\nHow much of the delay is incompetence or cash flow stress?\nVenezuela is surely in \u201cpenny pinching\u201d mode. The economy is in a shambles. The country is getting poorer by the minute. An OPEC output cut today should provide it with some lift, as some market analysts like Naeem Aslam of Think Markets in London believe oil can easily stay in the $50s now that supply will ease from the main producers. This is a positive for PdVSA on the margin.\nAs far as what investors really know about PdVSA's ability to pay, there is actually limited information on that. Data transparency in Venezuela is minimal. We know the central bank has around $11 billion in reserves, more than enough to service PdVSA debt (para 1-7). Rapoza, K. (2016).

While this surely is not a comfort to those that have to trek hundreds of miles into Colombia to buy food, the country is not insolvent. It may avoid a default after all, even as Fitch Ratings says one is imminent.\nMaduro\u2019s government has a high willingness to pay its debts, meaning as bad as things are, Venezuela might not become Argentina. Argentina defaults almost every 10 years, making it harder for the country to attract foreign capital, and forcing middle income and the wealthy to distrust their own currency. All of this has negative impacts on the economy. If Venezuela doesn\u2019t default, it avoids blowing a bazooka sized whole through the chest of a nation that appears to be either a heartbeat away from a full blown coup detat, or shutting the doors to the world.\nThe good news: Venezuela is fundamentally solvent.\nIf Saudi Arabia\u2019s state owned oil firm ARAMCO is worth about $3 trillion with some 310 billion of oil reserves then, Venezuela\u2019s comparable oil major PDVSA is worth nearly the same with around 510 billion barrels of estimated recoverable oil reserves there (para. 1-5).

Low Growth: IMF forecasts that Venezuela will foresee a double-digit GDP contraction in 2016. As growth slows, the debt-to-GDP ratio becomes even more unsustainable, with the government needing to rely on even larger debt issuance to prevent a further contraction (a self-reinforcing loop). This could potentially lead to fiscal dominance in the long run, and investors flee the market as Venezuelan bonds reek of default. Oil Prices: Although oil entered a bull market earlier on, it was due to a low base. Currently, it has fallen back into the $40 range. Low oil prices proves to be a bane for PDVSA, as their borrowing capacity depends on the market-perceived value for the barrels of oil which they can retrieve from the wells that they own. Ultimately, this has implications for Venezuela, as oil export revenues account for 95% of export earnings. Current low oil prices do not bode well for their fiscal sustainability, resulting back to point 1.

It\u2019s now also one that is getting front-page treatment from China, one of the Latin American country\u2019s biggest financial backers.\n     On June 11, the People\u2019s Daily -- the mouthpiece paper of China\u2019s Communist Party -- published an article in its overseas edition with the headline \u201cWill Venezuela Default?\u201d After considering its willingness and ability to pay, the author concludes the answer is no and chalks up all the talk about default to media speculation. The article also makes the case for China, whose $3.2 trillion of foreign reserves are the world\u2019s largest, to maintain its support to Venezuela.\n     \u201cFrom a long-term perspective, it makes emotional and rational sense for the Chinese side to provide aid within our capacity for partners stuck in economic difficulty like Venezuela,\u201d the article said.\n     QuickTake: In Venezuela, Chavez Heir Tested as Revolution Fades\n     Yet despite its apparent willingness to back Venezuela, Barclays Plc and Exotix Partners LLP are part of a growing group of market watchers that are skeptical that China is truly prepared to increase financing. Over the past decade, China has lent Venezuela about $50 billion, much of it intended to be repaid with oil supplies. But with Venezuela\u2019s economy in tatters and political tensions rising, the country is struggling mightily to stay current on its debt.\n     \u201cChina does not seem willing to increase exposure to Venezuela in the current conditions of political and economic uncertainty,\u201d said Alejandro Arreaza, an analyst at Barclays.\n\u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if they increase the debt.\u201d\n     He estimates Venezuela owes about $20 billion to China.\n     China\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t reply to a Bloomberg request for comment on the People\u2019s Daily article and the country\u2019s financial commitment to Venezuela. \n     Last month, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the country agreed to explore ways to make the financing cooperation with Venezuela \u201cmore flexible\u201d as oil prices plunge.\nOn Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said the two countries have enjoyed \"real benefits\" from cooperation.                           Oil, Economy      Back when China\u2019s appetite for oil and commodities seemed endless, the Asian nation bolstered its influence in Latin America through funding deals with a number of countries.\nVenezuela sits on the world\u2019s biggest oil reserves.\n     Venezuela didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment on financing from China. Vice President for Economic Policy Miguel Perez Abad had said in a May interview that China wants to keep supporting Venezuela, and a renewal of a $5 billion loan was likely to be completed in about 60 days.\n     The International Monetary Fund predicts Venezuela\u2019s economy will shrink 8 percent in 2016, while its inflation rate will reach about 480 percent. The country depends on oil for 95 percent of its export revenue. \n     And with Venezuelans fed up with worsening shortages of everything from basic medicine to toilet paper, a push to oust President Nicolas Maduro is gaining traction and threatening to heighten political infighting.\n     Not surprisingly, Venezuela\u2019s debt is the most expensive to insure against non-payment in the world, based on credit-default swaps.\n     \u201cEven if China is less willing to provide money, I think publicly they will still try to send supportive messages,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, an analyst at London-based Exotix.\n\u201cVenezuela sees China as very important, and as a key source of financing, and I think the reverse is perhaps not so true as it was.

Looting, arrests soar as Venezuela\u2019s food crisis mounts\nPeter Wilson, Special for USA TODAY 6:01 p.m. EDT June 15, 2016\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/15/venezuela-protests-lootings/85939072/ LA VICTORIA, Venezuela \u2014 Hungry Venezuelans escalated attacks on trucks carrying scarce food to the country\u2019s largest cities Wednesday, a day after hundreds of protesters were arrested by security forces. Photos on social media showed looters attacking trucks on the highway that connects Venezuela\u2019s main port of Puerto Cabello to the industrial city of Valencia. Others said that trucks ferrying food now can\u2019t enter Cumana due to frequent attacks being carried out on the highways entering the city. Looting and violent protests are threatening President Nicolas Maduro's hold on power. \u201cAll it would take would be for the military to react violently to a protest, or just step back and let one go, and an epidemic of protests could emerge and grow out of control,\u201d said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. Maduro blames the looting on his opponents, who are promoting a referendum to recall him. Looting was reported throughout the country, including Caracas, where merchants refused to open their shops. A tense peace reigned Wednesday in Cumana \u2014 one of Venezuela\u2019s poorest cities \u2014 following the arrival of hundreds of National Guardsmen and police. The city\u2019s mayor decreed a three-day ban on all motorcycles, which are often used by looters to flee. More than 170 people were detained. Maduro sent a trusted aide, Freddy Bernal, the former mayor of the Libertador borough of Caracas, to the city to evaluate the situation. \u201cThe people, the PSUV (Maduro\u2019s United Socialist Party of Venezuela) and the government are united to neutralize the fascists,\u201d Bernal tweeted. National newspapers also reported that angry protesters Tuesday night torched the local headquarters of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in the western city of Lagunillas, while attacking the city hall. The actions took place after promised deliveries of powdered milk never arrived, infuriating residents who had waited all day in line. Protests and looting has soared as Venezuela\u2019s food crisis mounts. The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a human rights organization, said more than 10 cases of looting are erupting daily now. \u201cThe looting is going to continue because there\u2019s hunger,\u201d Roberto Briceno Leon, director of the organization, told the Associated Press. \u201cThe government\u2019s response appears to be insufficient or politicized, so people are resorting to robbery.\u201d Venezuela\u2019s opposition blames the economic policies of Maduro, and his iconic predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for a collapsing economy and soaring inflation. To avoid a debt default this year, the government has slashed imports to save foreign currency. It has created food and medicine shortages. Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, imports about 70% of the food it consumes. \u201cMy neighbors are only eating green bananas and mangoes to survive,\u201d said Carmen Lopez, a community organizer outside this central industrial city. \u201cPeople are hungry.

But Venezuela's blistering economic crisis is hitting them full on. Output in the country, which has the world's largest oil reserves, dropped to 2.37 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, according to OPEC data provided by Venezuela. That's down some 5 percent from April and nearly 11 percent from 2015's average, data showed on Monday, piling more stress on oil-dependent Venezuela as it wrestles with the economic crisis. The drop could also help erode a supply glut that has weighed on prices. Amid a cash crunch, Venezuela's oil industry is suffering from shortages of spare parts, the retreat of oil services companies due to unpaid bills, maintenance issues, and crime, according to workers, union leaders, and foreign executives.\" There was a note of optimism from one pundit: \"...Wall Street is also monitoring the lower output amid default fears, although President Nicolas Maduro insists Venezuela will honor all debts. \"In the short term, it will negate some of the recent oil price rise and make the bond payments in late-2016 and 2017 more difficult, though not necessarily impossible,\" said a U.S.-based fund manager.\" http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-idUSKCN0Z025R\n"], [21884, "2016-06-15T01:49:32Z", [0.07], ""], [1708, "2016-06-14T23:15:01Z", [0.7], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-china-idUSKCN0Z01VH"], [368, "2016-06-14T18:36:28Z", [0.15], ""], [10192, "2016-06-14T17:55:44Z", [0.1], ""], [26047, "2016-06-14T16:25:14Z", [0.44], "The question is probably when not if Venezuela/PDVSA will default but whether they default between now and the deadline depends on oil and gold prices.

Under the deal, a subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, would issue a three-year international bond and hand it to approved suppliers in exchange for cancelling some of the $20 billion worth of unpaid invoices. The bond would be priced at about a 40% discount to the company\u2019s benchmark obligation, which currently trades at about 45 cents on the dollar, said the sources and the deal prospectus. PDVSA representatives began sounding out local and international suppliers last week to gauge interest in the swap, and the company has hired Miami firm CP Capital Securities to arrange the transaction, said the sources. PDVSA and CP Capital didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment. \u201cCP Capital has been hired to advise PDVSA on the exchange of commercial invoices for financial debt with a minimum amount of $2.5 billion,\u201d read a deal prospectus viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Venezuela\u2019s oil production has slipped 150,000 barrels this year to 2.5 million barrels per day, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as service giants Schlumberger and Halliburton reduced activity because of unpaid bills. The government has been struggling to boost output to alleviate acute shortages of imported food and medicine, which are fuelling riots and looting across the country. Both contractors interviewed by the Wall Street Journal said they would reject the deal in its current form, as the value of the offered bonds is less than the amount of debt they expect to get back through litigation. The bond issue would raise the financial burden for a government already struggling to meet its international obligations. The Venezuelan government and PDVSA are due to make about $6 billion worth of bond payments through the end of the year, obligations which consultancy Sintesis Financiera believes can only be met by cutting imports of basic goods to the lowest per capita levels since the 1950s."], [691, "2016-06-03T17:57:34Z", [0.58], ""], [5386, "2016-06-03T11:00:04Z", [0.9], ""], [689, "2016-06-03T06:14:16Z", [0.51], ""], [5386, "2016-06-03T04:22:39Z", [0.8], ""], [6303, "2016-06-03T02:35:13Z", [0.8], "According to the general news and GJP consensus."], [1529, "2016-06-02T23:15:05Z", [0.69], ""], [691, "2016-06-02T21:43:57Z", [0.57], "Rising oil prices will help him, and he has no intention of allowing the constitutionally required recall vote.

According to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, the country has an estimated external debt of more than $120 billion, and is on the hook for about $10 billion worth of payments this year. Still, Venezuela has always paid its debt, even during the Latin America debt crisis, Phillips noted.

President Nicholas Maduro had announced late last month that public employees should only go to work on Monday and Tuesday and told school children to not come in on Fridays.The ruling Socialist Party has confirmed the controversial limitations would last until at least 27 May. The government had previously announced a change in the time zone, pushing the clocks forward by half an hour in order to guarantee extra daylight in the evenings - reversing a move to turn them back that  been from 2007. Other measures to try and help with the energy crisis including daily black-outs, while a hairdryer ban has been imposed to try and conserve electricity. The crisis has stemmed from lengthy droughts and low rainfall in the country caused by the El Nino weather system. The vast majority of Venezuela\u2019s electricity comes from hydropower and the country\u2019s biggest dams have been hit by the lack of rain. Last week Maduro said in a televised address that the water levels at Guri Hydroelectric Power Plant in the north of the country had fallen to minimum operating level. He argued changes to the working week ensured the government did not have to impose high energy bills on Venezuela\u2019s already suffering population. In 2009 droughts resulted in the need for similar national black-outs and industrial production was halted. Venezuela is currently in the grip of a spiralling economic recession, with thousands of families struggling under chronic food shortages. The inflation rate stands at around 300 per cent and continues to rise, following a slump in oil prices. The country is now entering its rainy season so it is hoped the water shortage will be short-lived.

The military is planning a major exercise for Friday and Saturday. Venezuela's economic and political crisis continued on Thursday, as the military called on everybody in the country to participate in exercises meant to counter a supposed United States invasion. Embattled President Nicolas Maduro called the military exercises earlier this week after expanding a state of emergency in response to opposition calls for a referendum for him to step down. \"Venezuela is threatened,\" Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said on state television on Thursday. \"This is the first time we are carrying out an exercise of this nature in the country. In terms of national reach, it's going to be in every strategic region.\" Earlier in the week, Maduro said he had called the military exercises scheduled for Friday and Saturday to ready the oil-rich country against an impending US invasion. The emergency powers give the military and Socialist party militia sweeping powers to impose public order and distribute food. The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the emergency powers were constitutional \"given the extraordinary social, economic, political, natural and ecological circumstances that are gravely affecting the national economy.\" The opposition, which controls the legislature, has rejected the decree and pressed on with calls for the country's electoral body to recognize a petition that gained enough signatures to call a referendum against Maduro. Polls show some 70 percent of Venezuelans want Maduro to step down. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles has called on the army turn against Maduro and for the public to defy the state of emergency. National Assembly speaker Henry Ramos Allup said on Wednesday the government needed to come to the table to reach a peaceful end of the crisis. \"We don't want a bloodbath or a coup d'etat,\" he said. The dual economic and political crisis has reached such a boiling point that the US intelligence community last week assessed Venezuela could face massive social upheaval and revolt as even the most basic of goods run out. Meanwhile, political stalemate has drawn in international mediators to diffuse what former Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero called \"a long, hard and difficult path.\" Zapatero is leading a team of mediators including the former presidents of Panama and the Dominican Republic, Martin Torrijos and Leonel Fernandez.\nThey met with Capriles on Thursday after holding talks with Maduro. The Organization of American States (OAS) is also being drawn in. The Venezuelan National Assembly on Thursday asked the regional body to act \"before it is too late.\" In a letter to OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, the opposition-controlled legislature urged him to intervene given \"the process of dismantling democratic institutions and to prevent the humanitarian crisis from worsening in health and food as well as exponentially increasing the risk of violence.\"\n"], [368, "2016-05-29T21:12:54Z", [0.85], ""], [556, "2016-05-29T18:45:05Z", [0.75], "Moving back up based on....

Combined with its willingness to tap dwindling reserves, especially gold, there is a 55% probability that Venezuela can avoid defaulting on its debt and interest payments, according to Eurasia Group Analysts Risa Grais-Targow and Agata Ciesielska. They write: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\u201cContrary to our expectations, the government has proven willing to aggressively slash imports this year. Our view had previously been that despite a very high willingness to continue servicing external debt, the government would default in the fourth quarter of this year, based in part on the assumption that President Nicolas Maduro could not afford to repeat last year\u2019s level of import contraction in the wake of December\u2019s electoral loss and facing calls for a recall vote. However, import data from the first two months of the year shows that the government is willing to undergo an even more significant external adjustment than last year, when imports contracted by 21% year-on-year. During the first two months of the year, imports contracted by 42% year-on-year, according to ecoanalitica, and still worsening scarcity suggests that the government continued this strategy in March and April. Should the government maintain this level of imports for the remainder of the year, it would bring total imports to around $21 billion, a dramatic reduction from last year\u2019s $37 billion and the 2012 high of $65 billion \u2026 The government will enter next year with minimal reserves and facing calls for Maduro to leave office.

Unless, oil recovers, and fast. Or the government changes its socialist policies, fast. Neither looks likely to me. It's a sad state of affairs, and a sad situation.

For the first time since Q3 2008 oil production from all districts fell, including that of the Orinoco Oil Belt (OOB), where production had been on the rise since Q1 2009.\u201d The report indicates the drop in production is due to Drilling inefficiency due to hobbled Chinese rigs\nGas compression plant mismanagement as a result of inadequate well pressurization and increased flaring\nRedistribution of nearly 1.2 bcf/d of natural gas that used to be injected to promote crude recovery\nLack of well maintenance\nSeverely restricted access to barges to support offshore operations\nRampant theft of electricity cables that impairs electricity supply to many wells.\nGeneration units falling into disrepair\nDiluent shortages caused by liquidity issues and falling production from North Monagas fields IPD also reports restricted cash flow which have further delayed payments to contractors, who have begun to downsize operations \u2013 a point which has little to do with the Q1 2016 oil production drop, but it will certainly have a significant impact in the future. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-output-idUSKCN0XU22R\nVenezuela 2016 oil output seen down at 2.35 million bpd: consultancy\nTue May 3, 2016 8:09pm EDT SIDOR has not produced liquid steel since January, according to union leaders at the plant, who report that key spare parts have been requested abroad but there is no FOREX to pay for them, More in Spanish: (El Mundo, http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/economia/politicas-publicas/sidor-continua-sin-producir-acero-liquido-desde-en.aspx#ixzz47m2NFhKK)"], [14253, "2016-05-07T01:18:20Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2016-05-06T18:39:01Z", [0.85], ""], [691, "2016-05-06T17:32:04Z", [0.76], ""], [10192, "2016-05-05T21:35:12Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2016-05-05T20:31:34Z", [0.72], ""], [368, "2016-05-05T18:51:52Z", [0.85], ""], [24721, "2016-05-05T17:42:49Z", [0.99], ""], [23562, "2016-05-05T17:15:42Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2016-05-04T18:35:37Z", [0.71], ""], [368, "2016-05-04T17:50:03Z", [0.85], ""], [12828, "2016-05-04T17:46:18Z", [0.98], ""], [22833, "2016-05-04T15:53:41Z", [1.0], ""], [14253, "2016-05-04T15:14:30Z", [1.0], "I am confirming my 100% after reading another saddening story in the Washington Post.

Venezuela, in other words, is well past the point of worrying that its economy might collapse. It already has. That's the only way to describe an economy that the International Monetary Fund thinks is going to shrink 8 percent and have 720 percent inflation this year. And that's not even the worst of it. No, that's the fact that the state itself is near collapse. Venezuela already has the world's second-highest murder rate, and now the Chavista regime seems to be threatening violence of its own if the opposition succeeds in recalling President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. It's a grim race between anarchy and civil war. This is an entirely man-made catastrophe. Venezuela, by all rights, should be rich. As we just said, it has more oil than the United States or Saudi Arabia or anyone else for that matter. But despite that, economic mismanagement on a world-historical scale has barely left it with enough money to even, well, pay for printing money anymore.

To be clear, this is true of any sovereign debtor, or any debtor generally.  Venezuela's situation is perhaps unique among sovereigns, however, in that its willingness to pay seems to far outstrip its ability to pay.  Contrast this situation to Argentina under CFK; despite having more than sufficient resources to pay the holdouts - especially once additional hard currency funds that could be raised via capital markets are considered - CFK chose to wage a decade long war to avoid making good on its obligations.  So, let's take each component in turn (1) Ability to pay.  Venezuela's ability to service its hard currency debts is a function of (a) its existing stock of hard currency reserves, (b) additions to these reserves via exports and, (c) reductions to these reserves due to imports.  The existing stock of reserves is (as of April 2016), according to the central bank, $12.6bn.  Analysts have produced a huge range of estimates for actual reserves - many including CITGO assets, some making dozens of adjustments to official numbers - that deviate substantially from the official number.  I tend to view the 'actual' number as unknowable, given the opacity of Venz's reporting.  As such, I will take the $12.6bn number as given.  Regarding exports, the only important driver is of course the price of oil.  At $45 brent crude, Venz generates ~$30bn in oil exports.  Net this against $5-$10bn in oil-related imports, plus all other imports needed for the economy to function (such as it does).  This latter number can perhaps be estimated by looking at the minimum level of imports in the darkest days under Chavez.  This level would be ~$20bn in imports, which comports nicely with the recent trends in actual Venz imports.  As such, we have ~$30bn in exports, versus ~$30bn in total imports, giving a current account balance before debt service of ~$0.  If oil were to return to $30, however, we would find ourselves with a $10bn hole; I'll return to this later.   Through January 2017, Venz and PDVSA have combined debt service (principal + interest) obligations of $7.3bn.  So, with $12.6bn of current hard reserves, no change in this figure due to the current account, and $7.3bn of obligations, Venz/PDVSA could sneak through Jan 2017 without a default.  Whether Venz would want to drain its reserves to such a precarious level moves us into discussing willingness to pay. (2) Willingness to pay.  Venezuela has shown an extraordinary willingness to pay foreign creditors.  One plausible explanation is the existence - quite rare for a deeply troubled sovereign - of substantial assets outside the country's borders.   These assets could potentially be available for attachment.  Regardless of the reason, Venezuelan authorities have been consistent in their desire to pay foreign creditors.  Chavismo has a further very strong incentive to avoid a default before February 2017.  Under the Venezuelan constitution, if current President Maduro completes at least 2/3 of his term (i.e. gets through January 2017) then, in the case of a successful recall referendum, the current Vice President will take over.  If a recall referendum is called before this date, new elections would be called, in which case a member of the opposition would almost surely win.  To the extent that authorities believe a default would increase the odds of a recall, avoiding a default through January would be preferred.   So, we're left with an entity with a high willingness to pay in most scenarios and a marginal ability to pay given current oil prices.  Much lower oil prices would shift the math materially.  If oil prices were to be unchanged through January, I would peg the odds of default as quite low, perhaps 20%.  The possibility of materially lower oil prices, however, increases the odds of a default.  Without occupying space here analyzing historical oil price volatility, I would say that much lower oil prices add perhaps 15% to my status-quo 20%.  This leaves me with a 35% chance Venz/PDVSA will default before 1 Feb 2017. *********************************\nUpdate 9 May 2016:\nA further clarification is needed to the 'clarification' added 25 April 2016 (\"Restructuring of debt will not count as a default\").  ISDA definitions currently include Restructurings as credit events.  A coercive restructuring, in which bondholders are effectively forced to accept materially diminished economics and ISDA declares a credit event, would certainly seem to fit the spirit of the primary question here.  The inclusion of Collective Action Clauses in Venz's sovereign debt (thought not PDVSA's...) presumably make such an outcome more likely.  Perhaps the intent of the 'clarification' was to exclude a voluntary restructuring?  The ISDA committee, I believe, would not declare a credit event if a truly voluntary restructuring occurred.  Maybe then a better way to phrase the clarification would be something like: \"Any restructuring of Venezuela sovereign debt or PDVSA debt that the ISDA committee concludes does not constitute a credit event will not constitute a default for purposes of this question.\""], [4634, "2016-04-27T17:44:25Z", [0.42], ""], [10759, "2016-04-27T17:44:19Z", [0.42], ""], [691, "2016-04-27T15:47:50Z", [0.68], ""], [734, "2016-04-27T14:05:05Z", [0.86], "increasing +10, and providing just a little more gasoline for the fire... http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/venezuela-faces-its-strangest-shortage-yet-as-inflation-explodes From the above:\n\"Venezuela, in other words, is now so broke that it may not have enough money to pay for its money.\"\n"], [24418, "2016-04-27T13:39:13Z", [0.8], ""], [961, "2016-04-27T12:48:46Z", [0.85], ""], [10916, "2016-04-27T11:06:24Z", [0.32], ""], [15621, "2016-04-27T08:58:53Z", [0.74], ""], [24405, "2016-04-27T06:51:39Z", [0.95], ""], [556, "2016-04-27T06:37:01Z", [0.75], ""], [15548, "2016-04-27T04:17:47Z", [0.83], ""], [3363, "2016-04-27T02:49:47Z", [0.59], "\"Restructuring of debt will not count as a default.\" That is incorrect.

The hope . . .  is that they can secure enough promises of outside support to persuade dissident chavistas, of which there are many, to join the opposition in a government of national unity. Their plan is to save the country from default by increasing hydrocarbon production, securing the necessary investment from multilateral institutions and trading partners such as China. \"Underlying the plan is a conviction that default would be not only catastrophic but unnecessary. Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world  . . . . time is what Venezuela needs. . . .  two years will do: enough to increase production at PDVSA from today\u2019s level of about 2.7m barrels per day to about 3.1m bpd by September 2018, recovering the amount of production lost over the past four years. \"At March 2016 prices, . . .  this would deliver an extra $5.8bn a year, enough to service PDVSA\u2019s debts. . . .  by restarting inactive wells and other measures, by 2021 production could be restored to 3.5m bpd, a level last seen in 1998. This . . .  would require annual investment of $15bn-$20bn, less than the average of more than $30bn a year spent to little effect under PDVSA\u2019s investment plan for 2012 to 2015. \". . .  a credible plan and an \u201corganised political transition\u201d could allow a new government to \u201csecure around $37bn from multilateral and bilateral institutions, including the export/import banks of Venezuela\u2019s trading partners.\u201d   \"China\u2019s role would be key. . . .

First, it can pull the plug on the petrostate. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that, if China suspects that Venezuela may not be able to pay them back in the future, they withdraw their financing,\u201d said Edward Glossop of Capital Economics. \"Second, it could formally bail out Venezuela, turning the government into a direct debtor.

The government is clearly not capable of implementing the wholesale overhaul of the economy that is required, even if the various, and increasingly embittered, factions within the chavista movement could agree on how to proceed. The opposition is also unproven but . . . understands what needs to be done and would have international goodwill and the ability to recruit foreign expertise. \"So is a peaceful political transition possible? Venezuela is on its way to democracy and it is unlikely that Maduro can do more than delay what looks like an inevitable fall from power. But, as Medley warns, such transitions can be messy as the layers of authoritarianism that have been built up over years are dismantled. The government controls most of the institutions, including the Supreme Court. The latter can, for example, spin things out by overturning decisions made by the opposition in the national assembly, though its judges would be unlikely to stand firm against overwhelming public protests. The army is another matter and if it intervened to support the government it could trigger bloodshed.

The Venezuelan government has prioritized debt payments over many other things and that attitude will likely continue. However, they may just run out of money. Foreign reserves, including gold, can only pay for about 8-10 more months of imports at the bare-bones levels.
