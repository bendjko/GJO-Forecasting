I think what Putin wants in to link up the Russian-controlled enclave in the Donbas with Crimea, which will also give some strategic depth to Russian holdings in Ukraine. he also wants to permanently keep the rump Ukraine as a buffer state between Russia and NATO. So the problem is, what happens if Putin launches a sudden, successful - but limited - attack into Ukraine and stops at the Dnieper, (or just short of it, to not directly threaten Kyiv) then calls for a Security Council meeting, and proposes a cease-fire? Soon after, he proposes a solution to the whole problem, and Russian, Ukrainian, and Western diplomats periodically meet to hammer out a deal. And of course, the longer the talking goes on with the Russian Army in place, the more likely it is that the conflict will be permanently frozen, with no fighting, no Russian withdrawal, and no progress. So Putin wins one way or the other. Everybody (the press, Western diplomats, etc.) keeps talking about Russia wanting to reabsorb Ukraine, and Ukraine training civilians for guerilla war, and all that, but I consider all this absurd on its face. Putin wants Ukraine as a buffer state, so I think he will try to leverage any military success he has to preserve it as such. I think what he might want is a new border on the Dnieper in the south, and one of its shallow tributaries in the center and north. From what I understand these eastern portions of Ukraine are generally are areas with 50% or more Russian speakers, or at least approach the total of 50% Russian speakers. I suppose provincial borders might be redrawn, too. The smaller rivers provide no military obstacle, but do provide what can be presented as a reasonable demarcation line. In the south, the Dnieper is a formidable obstacle. So at the UN, Putin proposes to demonstrate his good faith by pulling back from the areas north of Poltava Oblast (which he doesn't want anyway), and tightens up his defensive line in the areas he actually covets. In the meantime, the west can claim that they made him at least partially climb down. As for Ukraine, he could propose its permanent neutralization, in the manner of Austria in 1954, or of Finland's less formal status during the Cold War. This, and the  strategy I outline above, would give Putin the two things I believe he wants: a land link between the Donbas and Crimea, and the continued existence of Ukraine as a buffer state.  So what does the West do in this kind of scenario? Do the western powers on the Security Council reject the opportunity for a cease-fire? Do they let the Kyiv government dictate their answer, and take a chance of being sucked in further, and indefinitely? Do they insist the war continue? If so, are they willing to actually send troops? Anyway, if Putin does not overplay his hand (which I don't think he will), the West may be faced with some tough choices, mostly imposed by its reckless policies and overheated rhetoric.  I should add that I have no idea if anything like this will happen, but I am convinced that Putin's objectives are much less ambitious than they are portrayed in the Western press."], [104049, "2022-01-17T16:20:41Z", [0.1], "The Russian buildup of forces along the Ukraine border is intensifying.

But I'm not adjusting up that much. Here are some things I learned from the conversation that seem somewhat at odds with the group's general pessimism about a large-scale invasion and/or air war. - Russian soldiers returning home in bodybags is apparently unpopular. This is not something I had really considered, and God knows if this is something Putin cares about, but it was presented as something he would want to avoid. Take that as given- a bit. - Evidently, Ukrainian civilians have been receiving guerrilla training (!), and there is a sense (not sure how much to trust this) that, if invaded, Ukraine will fight. - There is also some sense that Putin will want to avoid leveling Ukraine and may want to avoid bombing altogether - he has been making the argument domestically that Ukraine is historically part of Russia, so it will be hard to avoid the bad optics of bombing Kiev, the historical capital of the Rus. - Putin's primary interest in occupying Ukraine, aside from any cultural or imperialist affinities we might speculate about, is evidently to maintain a buffer state between Russia and what he sees as an increasingly expansionist NATO. - Putin will lose face domestically if he backs down. - The US obviously does not want a bloody invasion of Ukraine by Russia. I have repeatedly heard that the fact that Russia's extremist demands were rejected in Geneva means that war is inevitable. This does not make a lot of sense to me- you go to the negotiating table with an extreme position; nobody expects to have all their demands met. And it seems to me that neither side in this wants a bloody war, and will do lots to avoid it. It's not clear that they will be able to, and I will adjust upwards as time passes without a resolution. But it seems there are potentially lots of strategies that both sides could employ to avoid a conflict that results in casualties. - The US could rapidly arm Ukraine to deter the Russians\n- NATO troops could enter Ukraine from the West (!)\n- The Russians could conduct a limited invasion of Ukraine, perhaps into already-friendly areas, at a low risk of loss of life\n- The process could be prolonged until the Russian public forgets about it\n- The US could make a commitment that allows Russia to save face (such as limiting future US participation in joint NATO exercises in Eastern Europe) or, alternately, that satisfies some of Russia's concerns about NATO expansion."], [104246, "2022-01-16T22:48:45Z", [0.9], "Hundreds of soldiers have already died as a result of such confrontations since 2014, whether or not the casualties have been acknowledged by Russia to be national military forces.

The starting point is always: \"What is the base rate?\" which leads to \"What is the comparison set?\" I don't know. Invasions by Russia of Ukraine is like 20-40% over the last 5 years. Invasions by Russia of neighboring countries over the last 25 years is more like 1%. Call it 10% and that's probably high.

I agree with comments (e.g. @mattlerner and @fridhkleberg ) and US/Russia talks and Kazakhstan are material to this question.  Things I'm pondering:  1) US threats: In theory, the US (& ...) can impose \"crippling sanctions\". I suspect to a long-term thinker like Putin that doesn't sound as scary as US diplomats would hope. As the US learned in Iraq, once we transition from threatening to acting on those threats, it becomes clear that: a) they come at high cost to the US; b) they cannot be sustained indefinitely, which would be required; and c) we lose the ability to make the same threat credibly to any other country (e.g. North Korea) until we get out of Russia. What's to stop Russia from taking what it wants? Most importantly, they can and most likely will be reversed by the next administration in return for something else that it wants.\n2) Kasakhstan: could the Kremlin use a skirmish or more in Ukraine to send a message to Kasakhstan? Yes, but presumably Russia is heavily involved behind the scenes in Kasakhstan both in the set-up to the current turmoil and now in nudging things in a helpful direction for Russia. That makes me conclude that the causal arrow more likely points the other direction: Russia could be sending a message to Ukraine via Khazakhstan: \"we can destabilize you from within. We don't need to invade.\"\n3) Talks: Presumably neither side wants to destabilize the talks today, but the moment Russia isn't getting what they want from the talks, or wants more leverage, a small skirmish of some sort could be helpful in getting people focused back on the issue: that Russia holds the \"Chaos\" card; and all the west holds is the \"punishment/consequences\" card. In that situation, Russia will presumably want to destabilize in a way that isn't traceable to Russia's government. \n4) Bargaining positions: \nUS/West: The Biden government is in a uniquely weak position by almost every measure compared to the last 50 years. The Europeans don't seem ready to step up against Russia without credible US support, which Biden cannot offer. \nRussia: As mentioned above, I doubt the threat of sanctions is perceived as more than a high but affordable cost of to be weighed against benefits. Putin has his own internal factions to contend with and isn't as strong as he once was. The biggest problem may be the oligarches, who are also the main folks potentially impacted by sanctions. For him, maintaining a crisis environment may be helpful domestically / politically. On the world stage, destabilizing western governments / Russia's customers may be helpful to slow moves towards unhelpful climate change accords and blunt challenge to dominance in Russia's sphere, while not screwing up the economy in the west that drives oil and gas sales.

It seems like the crowd forecast needs to adjust downwards a bit to reflect that, but it hasn't budged.  To me it seems pretty clear that the Russian objective is to keep Ukraine from drifting further toward joining Nato/the EU. If that objective can be accomplished without invading, why would they invade? That doesn't make sense to me. I think the crowd is letting its emotions cloud its judgments here. When I look at the Russian-Georgian war, Russia had the same objective of keeping Georgia out of Nato. In that theatre of operation, the Russians outnumbered their opponents by 7 to 1. The Georgians engaged in a conventional war, in which they had no chance of winning. Russia's objective having been met, they pulled out.  The difference with Ukraine is that its military is a lot bigger and better equipped compared with Georgia's and it has a far more vast territory to use for defense in depth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth Its fighting men also have combat experience in Donbas. It's also fully prepared to use guerrilla warfare to exact a huge long-term price on the Russians. See, e.g., https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/guerrilla-tactics-offer-ukraines-best-chance-against-putins-invasion-force/. In short, Russia has a very real risk of getting caught in a quagmire in Ukraine, which would be an absolute disaster from its standpoint.  I am not sure just how much Nato members want Ukraine to join, but it sure doesn't seem like there's a lot of enthusiasm. This article says that no concrete steps have been taken to admit Ukraine, no matter how much Ukraine has wanted it: https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ukraine-and-nato-dont-ask-do/  The Brits have already publicly pre-announced they won't be defending Ukraine in the event of war: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59712020. This indicates to me that they oppose bringing Ukraine into Nato, otherwise why would they make that announcement? I haven't done an in-depth study of all the Nato countries and their stances toward bringing in Ukraine, but it's not as obvious as it was for, say, The Czech Republic. So the Nato stance toward Ukraine seems lukewarm at best.

On this point, I am not convinced by the security \"proposals\" [1] put forward by the Russian side and due to be discussed at NATO-Russia Council (NRC) level in January. Most of these are more or less no-starters for the West, and the longer the parties just keep putting up such demands to each other, the more bad blood will emerge - making escalation more likely. While the willingness of Russia to join talks in January is a good sign (if you harbor negative sentiments towars large-scale warfare in Europe, that is), the bar was set so high with these red lines that it is hard to see a way to deescalate without Russia feeling humiliated to some degree. Even if (and that certainly feels like a big if, looking at signals from Western officials thus far) NATO was ready to guarantee never extending membership to Ukraine, that would be a significant climbdown from the Russian position. The December 23 press event certainly gives no indication of willingness to avoid military action, repeating concerns about \"Nazis\" in Ukraine and the safety of the separatist territories [2]. Certainly it seems that there is ample room for Russia to leverage its official military on Ukrainian territory - within the confines of its objectives, i.e. meaningful impact on Kyiv policymaking [3]. Though I will admit I see this possibility as partially contradicted by the demands to meet with US officials only *ahead* of the NRC [4]. To me, this would indicate more bluffing and posturing for negotiations, as opposed to creating a timeline conducive to escalation. In other words, if you were interested in escalating at maximum pace while keeping a veneer of good faith, going from bilateral talks (a superpower heart-to-heart, in narrative terms) to bureaucratic multilateral discussions feels awkward (a quagmire). There is, of course, the possibility of cancelling NRC talks after bilateral meetings, claiming you feel the US is not taking your new position seriously and so neither will \"US lackeys\" - the rest of NATO. However, given that the last weeks of December saw de-escalation rather than escalation, it seems like the window of opportunity where Russia had its strongest hand has passed for now - see i.e. the trend in Neutral Gas Price [5] driven by weather & LNG market shuffles, amidst other things*. Prediction markets hover in the mid-40%s, though I believe the above developments lessen the probability somewhat. Anchoring at 40% for chance of *some official military presence of Russia* in Ukraine by cutoff date. Declines significantly after mid-March, or with significant withdrawals in the *Western* Military District, i.e. near Pogonovo [6].  What about the casualties? As many have noted, the threshold here is quite low, and any officially sanctioned use of even a part of the troops currently stationed near the border would most likely exceed it dramatically. What is our lower bound? If the conflict intensifies while Russia relies on Wagner/local troops for the frontlines, we may abstract from its record in Syria. Although far from a perfect comparison*, this gives some insight into \"Russia engages at arms length\" scenario, the lower bound here. A well-maintained Wikipedia record [7] shows a confirmed** total of 74 Russian servicemen killed by hostile fire in 2015-2021, with a simple average of just over 10,5 per year. However, in the high-intensity years of 2015-2017, they exceeded over 1,5 per month on average. This is of some 4.000 troops, although many were posted far out of harms way. 0,375 casualties per month per a thousand soldiers is, again, a low-ball - and the rate increases substantially as the proportion shifts towards on-the-ground troops. And while earlier incursions have seen official troops quickly retreat and be replaced by paramilitaries/PMCs, given the rhetoric and scenarios that would lead to the conflict in the first place, the likelihood of longer-term official presence seems greater. Equally, this assumes zero symmetry - only accounting for Russian casualties. So even in the most downscaled potential scenario, the likelihood of exceeding 3 casualties total is quite high. Moreover, the most downscaled scenario itself is unlikely if open conflict does emerge, with each subsequent increase in intensity all but guaranteed to exceed that number.  Two standard deviations feel conservative enough this far out; 95% chance of exceeding the stated casualties contingent on a Russian military presence in Ukraine. 38% for now, but things can move fast here. In absence of serious developments, update by late February at the latest, with a trend towards lesser probability thereafter.  ------------- * Do note this is separate from a question of whether the prices are still very high, which certainly seems to be the case and most likely will be for an extended period; weather forecasts seem to indiciate the first week of January will see another rise, but it is beyond this question to analyse the impact of that on gas prices.\n** Intuitively, it would seem Russia will not be able to flex its air power like in Syria, which may decrease the opportunities for confrontation in an arms-length scenario. However, the same modern weaponry means any confrontation will be much more likely to turn deadly. Also, as per [3], juxtaposing from the conflict in the Balkans would lead us to expect a protracted campaign, further increasing the probability. One must also keep in mind artillery strikes, which retain their potency even if official Russian troops stay far from the frontlines.\n*** There is, of course, strong circumstantial evidence that official Russian troops died in Ukraine, i.e. in Debaltseve. However, as several forecasters have noted, attribution and confirmation will always be an issue in this question, leading also to the use of Syrian data as proxy.

I will say already now that this does absolutely not include pro-Russian separatist elements that on one hand act as Russian proxies but could also get into a fight through own motivations or whatever (say sub-par decision-making arising from having a few drinks too much, which is not a joke if you look at some reporting and frankly what can be observed on the ground). My impression from both Russian and well-read Western analysts is that Russia is mainly trying to force Western powers (which the Russian security policy elite I think really believes is pulling the strings of Ukraine in a global/regional power struggle) to respect and acquiesce to Russia's wished vis-a-vis European security norms and Russian national security interests. Trying to annex Donbas is not, I dare say, an economically attractive prospect for a country with substantial economic woes as it is. Having the \"people's republics\" remain a perpetually destabilising spoiler region for Ukraine is probably more useful for Russia if it seeks to weaken its neighbour. Russia could still do it because for ideological reasons, but I don't think it makes practical sense at least. Right now what we can for ease refer to as Western actors really don't want further escalation, but looking at what is actually being said by multiple US Government figures (State Sec. Blinken, Def Sec Austin), along with NATO and EU heads, it seems clear that no one is interested in supporting Ukraine in an actual shooting war against Russia. Economic sanctions, maybe some cyber, and telling Putin he's a naughty boy seems to be what's currently on the table (despite the U.S. penchant for \"strategic ambiguity\" which I suspect just comes off as bluffing to the Kremlin). One conclusion which a lot of people will not like is that this means giving Russia something if it is to be persuaded to play nice. This has worked before for Russia. Blinken struck a rather conciliatory tone after meeting Lavrov yesterday, everyone is talking up diplomacy, a Putin-Biden meeting seems to be in the cards etc etc. For all the reasons above I think short term that Russia will likely not attack Ukraine directly (escalating through proxies, especially ahead of some sort of negotiations is another question) in the short term, rather looking to see what they can out of the current situation. That said, unintentional escalation is a thing (very much a thing), things happen on the border, and I will definately say that my current forecast is subject to future revision. I was a bit unwilling to get into this because I feel I'd care more about being wrong than in other cases, but this is how I see it now. EDIT: Obviously there are other places where a clash could happen than Donbas, it is just that that is where the proxy option is most obvious. \nEDIT 2: I forgot completely to end on what is my other big caveat: I am concerned that I am unintentionally answering \"what do I think would be the smart thing to do\" rather than \"what is likely to happen\", which I think is a common analytical error.

Unfortunately, this seems to be one of those questions where the casually read statement invites one (me at least!) to forecast on a question that is not actually the one being asked. My new viewpoint centers on the specifics of the wording: \"...BETWEEN the NATIONAL MILITARY FORCES...of RUSSIA AND UKRAINE...\". The short of it is: officially, the national military forces of Russia have been involved in virtually zero \"official\" fighting with the national military forces of Ukraine. Instead, almost all fighting, exchanges of fire, fatalities, etc. since 2014 have occurred between Russian-backed \"separatists\" and the national forces of Ukraine, at least officially. Even during the de-facto annexation of Crimea, only three actual service members seem to have been killed (vs \"protesters\"). The closest thing I can find to any recorded \"official\" battle in this conflict is an alleged 2016 incident, where Russia claims that Ukraine special forces killed two members of the Russian military near Armyansk. There is evidence that supporting artillery fire in battles has come from Russian territory, but no proof that it wasn't those border-crossing \"separatists\"... Please help me out if I'm way off-base here! Perhaps some will also make the argument that at least some of the \"separatist\" fighting force (armed with artillery, advanced anti-aircraft weapons, etc.) are actually de-identified Russian commandos, and therefore should count. If so, this raises the sticky question of how exactly we are defining \"Russian national military forces\" for this question. For example, if a member of the Russian Ground Forces were to remove identifying insignias from their uniform (or fight in civilian attire), does that count as \"national military forces\"? For now, I am assuming that the \"separatists\" do not count, and so the high likelihood of continued combat between official Ukrainian military and \"separatist\" elements will continue, but will be outside the scope of this question. My estimate of 4% for the in-scope probability derives in part from the multi-year lack of significant lethal confrontations between the two official militaries involved (so far). It also invokes as an additional analog the base-rates from recent history of the North-South Korean DMZ, where large numbers of two fairly mutually hostile militaries are standing across from each other currently, and where occasional incidents involving limited exchange of fire occasionally lead to qualifying numbers of fatalities. Specifically, the scenario envisioned corresponding to in-scope lethal confrontations will most likely involve a navigational error, weapons malfunction, or other unintentional event during near-border operations of either the Russian or Ukrainian military, that create a situation where fire is exchanged and 3+ service members are killed."], [97375, "2021-11-07T17:17:24Z", [0.17], ""], [691, "2021-11-07T16:27:30Z", [0.08], ""], [63401, "2021-11-07T14:06:05Z", [0.6], "This is a complex question to forecast, as there are significant deterrents to military action on both sides that would result in the deaths stated in the question. Russia has to be concerned about reputation and pressure on the world stage, US/European support for Ukraine as a counter balance to aggression, etc. Ukraine has to be concerned about poking the bear and provoking a reaction if it employs kinetic force. Nonetheless, Ukraine is receiving increased military support from others, including Turkey (armed drones that recently destroyed some Russia artillery (https://usukraine.org/news/articles/ukraine-uses-turkish-drone-for-the-first-time-warns-of-renewed-buildup-of-russian-troops-on-border/NjA4MjE=) ). Recently, a group of Ukrainian combat veterans were warmly welcomed to Washington, DC. (https://usukraine.org/news/articles/stronger-together/NjA4MTM=/). U.S. support for Ukraine remains strong and serves as a deterrent to Russia. Thus, tensions continue to build like magma heating under the surface of a volcano. WHEN is event described in the question going to happen (or when will a series of events add up to 3 deaths)? Sadly, I think the threshold of three service member deaths total will be achieved before the conflict is finally resolved at some point in the unforeseeable/difficult to see future. So, the question is therefore isolated to timing. Will the threshold death count be reached before or after the question deadline? I have gotten zapped on timing before (timing of delivery of the articles of impeachment for Trump, and timing of the death of RBG). I was accurate in the substance, but slightly off on the timing (and got hammered on my accuracy score). So the answer has to be yes (i.e. the probability cannot be zero, but that seems obvious, right?). But, also something close to the current 11% also seems overconfident, given the 10 months before the question closes. Remember, \"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen\"--Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Events can turn very quickly. I really hate close to 50% probabilities, as that is a coin flip and as a professional forecaster, means, \"I dunno.\" Sometimes that is as good as you can get. You can't tell. There are 312 days until the question closes, this is close to the limits of accurate forecasting of geopolitical events. Thus, I think a wide range is justified early on, then will narrow with time, and thoughtful consideration of new information as it becomes available. If I were to go narrower at this point, 1) I don't see facts or informations to support a narrower range, and 2) that narrower range would be speculative, or a guess. Some forecasters get lucky on guesses and claim to be \"right,\", but that is not effective forecasting in the long run.
