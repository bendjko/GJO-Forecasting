What Are The Chances For Any Of These Bills?

Two background check bills passed by the House in February have been languishing in the Senate ever since. However, a federal \u201cred flag\u201d bill could be an exception. And President Donald Trump could be a game-changer in this debate. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt, he would not put a gun bill on the Senate floor unless Trump said he would sign it. And over the weekend, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., reinforced the Senate majority\u2019s stance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote on bills on the Senate floor that the President is not willing to sign.\u201d Thus far, Trump has not made clear what, if any, gun legislation he would support.

I have now read the other forecasts, which are much more pessimistic than mine.  Originally, I had the chance of a bill NOT passing at about 80-85 percent.  Then, I remembered McConnell stating he was waiting for the president's lead so I reduced it to 75 percent.    After further thought, I realized McConnell's comment was just a few days after the last mass shooting.  That was about a month ago, and other events have taken over the news so there is less impetus to pass any gun bill right away.  Much of the next  the gun debate will be driven by news coverage of additional mass shootings.   There seems to be one major mass shooting (more than 6 or 7 people dead) every three or four months.  (The mass shootings of only three or four people dead get a lot less attention--even when children are involved.  I know because one happened not far from where I live a few months ago,  and it is all but forgotten.)    Thus, after looking at Wikipedia to see how many mass shooting occur each year and if they occur more or less in winter,  i think on average there should be about one large scale mass shooting between now and December 20.  \n\nThe second issue is will any gun legislation include a ban on high capacity magazines as opposed to just red flag laws or background checks favored overwhelmingly by Republicans.  I found only about 40 to 45 percent of Republicans support a ban on high capacity magazines. Impeachment will have an effect.  Trump wants to endear himself to the base so he will not back a high capacity magazine ban if only 43 percent -- or less of the conservative wing of his party-- support such a ban.  Also, the gun manufacturers oppose such a ban.   However, Trump has been saying he wants the government to get on with the business of government rather than focus on impeachment.  Therefore, he would welcome the chance to sign a gun bill that made the country feel safe in a high publicity  White House ceremony after a mass shooting.  The end result?   Unfortunately, an 80 percent chance -- or higher -- that there will be a significant mass shooting in the next two months sufficient to generate substantial media attention.   There is maybe a 20 percent chance, at best, that it would result in legislation.  (So far nothing has passed, but the rising frequency of mass shootings seems to be having an effect, .e.g., McConnell's comments.)  However, it is highly unlikely, maybe 20 percent a best, that such legislation would include a high capacity magazine ban with Trump in the White House.  So, ninety chance no bill.  But, Trump will sign it if it passes  since McConnell says he will only put to a vote a bill  that Trump will sign.   (.8 x .2 x .2= .032)  or about 96 percent no.

It also shows what such an effort entails \u2014 true bipartisanship, a committed White House, a readiness on all sides to compromise and a willingness by some lawmakers to take a significant political risk. \u201cWhen I voted for it, I actually had to have police protection for six months,\u201d Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, said of the backlash to his vote for the assault weapons ban. \u201cIt was really nasty.\u201d The consequences of the vote were so severe \u2014 Democrats lost the House after four decades of control, with the assault weapons ban ranking high among the reasons \u2014 that Congress has been unable to advance major gun safety legislation since. The epidemic of mass shootings and the rise of effective gun control advocacy groups have steadily shifted attitudes. Most Democrats are again willing to push ahead with universal background checks and other limits on gun ownership, though few are talking about trying to reinstitute the assault weapons ban. Congressional Republicans remain, for the most part, opposed to sweeping proposals, particularly without knowing where President Trump will land on the issue.\n. . . \nAfter the school massacre in 2012 in Newtown, Conn., Democrats and a handful of Republicans took a run at expanding background checks but came up short while a proposal to reinstate an assault weapons ban badly failed. Congress has made some very modest improvements to the background check system since then, but the coming weeks will be the most serious gun control push in years. The Democrat-led House has already passed its own measure expanding background checks, but only eight Republicans \u2014 including Representatives Upton and King \u2014 backed that bill.  . . . Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has said he would put on the floor only a measure the president supports. Despite a summer of mass shootings, it will be difficult for Congress and the White House to come together on major gun restrictions as they did for that moment in 1994.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  The last sentence sums up my thinking on this question."], [77718, "2019-09-08T19:18:37Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75], ""], [67635, "2019-09-08T18:56:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "To be a good member of the Good Judgement Program"], [12879, "2019-09-08T18:22:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.75], ""], [78624, "2019-09-08T16:07:01Z", [0.05, 0.3, 0.25, 0.4], ""], [79204, "2019-09-08T10:37:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "For money"], [1333, "2019-09-07T18:32:52Z", [0.0, 0.28, 0.0, 0.72], ""], [1034, "2019-09-07T15:57:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [15196, "2019-09-07T12:57:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-07T09:54:07Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.05, 0.88], ""], [1333, "2019-09-07T08:04:48Z", [0.0, 0.29, 0.0, 0.71], ""], [695, "2019-09-06T20:39:31Z", [0.02, 0.15, 0.02, 0.81], ""], [1333, "2019-09-06T19:19:06Z", [0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.7], ""], [1333, "2019-09-06T18:49:49Z", [0.0, 0.31, 0.0, 0.69], ""], [79079, "2019-09-06T18:38:19Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [77304, "2019-09-06T16:13:00Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.9], "There is no impetus for Congress to act on this"], [79169, "2019-09-06T15:45:54Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [77643, "2019-09-06T15:29:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [1285, "2019-09-06T15:26:07Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [72427, "2019-09-06T14:51:30Z", [0.01, 0.04, 0.03, 0.92], ""], [72427, "2019-09-06T14:50:50Z", [0.02, 0.08, 0.05, 0.85], ""], [11335, "2019-09-05T19:38:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2019-09-05T18:51:47Z", [0.0, 0.32, 0.0, 0.68], ""], [78028, "2019-09-05T16:48:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "GOP controlled Senate will not pass any such legislation."], [34353, "2019-09-05T16:24:09Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.0, 0.99], ""], [5002, "2019-09-05T13:21:19Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.75], ""], [1639, "2019-09-05T13:09:31Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [79128, "2019-09-05T11:59:38Z", [0.05, 0.05, 0.85, 0.05], "testing"], [79127, "2019-09-05T11:41:47Z", [0.0, 0.45, 0.45, 0.1], ""], [74142, "2019-09-05T08:26:34Z", [0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8], ""], [1333, "2019-09-04T18:49:14Z", [0.0, 0.33, 0.0, 0.67], ""], [79104, "2019-09-04T14:36:14Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.1, 0.7], ""], [78129, "2019-09-04T13:23:19Z", [0.07, 0.03, 0.07, 0.83], "With all the China trade wars, Brexit (as someone else here mentioned), etc... doesn't seem like this is highest priority, despite all recent horrors.

And I just realized that I have been forgetting to use the outside view itself.  @Emil, I am going to steal your format because I like it.  ~~~\nOutside View\n~~~ \nFrom the broader context of bills being passed through Congress, most of them do not get through. However, back in 1994, Bill Clinton did pass a bill that did stop Assault Rifles from being sold. Which lasted until 2004. Also, back last year, legislation was introduced to stop the making of 3D Printed guns which DJT did say \"Does not make much sense (allowing them)\". There is also some records of trump saying, doesn't the NRA have enough guns, when he was running for office. Though, he did allow them to happen.  So I am going to go out and say, there is a 94% chance of no ~~Mid Outside view?~~ On the porch maybe? The New York times just released an article on the growing number on the grades of Congress and the NRA. Dissent is growing in Congress with the Number of F's being at 243. Now to get through Congress you need about 218 votes. Let's assume that some of that 243 will not vote against the bill. And it drops to, 180 since this would be an aggressive ban. So we can drop the probability of No to about 91 percent. Given that a bill was passed through Congress in February.  As of February of 2018, The NRA gave 52 Senators A-'s as far as grades to the congress. Now that being said, could 3 of them be swayed a little bit? Maybe? After all, the 1994 bill got through the Senate at a 52-48 passing bill.  Therefore being somewhat doable maybe. That being said, a bill was introduced in January and it is still in committee.  Given the high frequency of assault weapon attacks, maybe one will happen in a state where there is enough pressure for a senator to change his mind. So I am going to drop mine to 83%. ~~~\nInside view\n~~~ \nTime kills us all, that is the truth. And the hard part of this bill being passed is, is  there enough time for the Senators to be swayed, and we are not in an election year so there is that I am going to upgrade my No to be at 89%.

This substantially alters the calculus in favor of this being more likely. However, some caveats: This was a small part of a tough on crime bill that was popular with both parties, it narrowly passed by a 52-48 vote in the Senate (this Senate had more than 52 Democrats), it garnered the votes of 46 House Republicans (which is nearly unimaginable now), and was signed into law by President Clinton (a Democrat).  Today, the House is also controlled by Democrats and it seems likely to pass such a ban - such legislation is already making its way through the chamber. However, the Senate is controlled by Republicans 53-47 and President Trump is a Republican. This legislation would not pass the Senate unless it were supported by Mr. McConnell, which in turn depends on President Trump's support for the legislation - and Mr. McConnell is unlikely to bring anything that President Trump does not support to the Senate floor, so the possibility of this legislation being passed but vetoed by Trump seems like the least likely option. The option that the President would neither sign nor veto such legislation if it were passed also seems fairly implausible, since Trump would almost certainly be keen on showing strength/decisiveness by taking action one way or another. As for President Trump's stance/thinking: despite showing some support for nonspecific gun reform (which may or may not include a high capacity magazine ban) after the recent spate of mass shootings, Trump appears to have backed off after a phone call with NRA chief Wayne LaPierre. Of course, Trump can change his mind again - as he has often done in the past - in fact, he banned bump stocks in December 2018, even though this move was opposed by the NRA. But it appears as if most of the reforms currently being considered by the Trump Administration are much softer than outright bans - strengthened background checks, red flag laws and such.

The numerator is 1, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994. [3, 4]. The denominator is hard to pin down but arguably it is very very large (e.g. every session of Congress, or every session of Congress during which gun control was a matter of public debate). Overall it is fair to say that any kind of legislative weapons ban is a very rare thing in US history. Second piece of historical context - only about 4-10% of bills become laws depending on your source [1,2]. A caveat to that is this question is not necessarily asking about a bill become a law but about passing through Congress, so the base rate should be somewhat higher but not by much.  ~~~\nInside view\n~~~ Recent shooting episodes, which came in quick succession, have brought gun control on the national agenda again. There is a chance of passage in the Democratic-controlled House. There has even been some support from GOP representatives [5]. However, the Senate will be a substantial deterrent, particularly with the filibuster in place (i.e. requiring a 60+ majority). It is more likely that discussion in the Senate will center around red-flag laws (i.e. background checks) which are much more feasible (though still unlikely). As for Trump, he is likely to sign it given that he pushed an executive ban on bump stocks through the government last year. All in all, both the Outside and Inside view point toward a very low likelihood. A counterargument may be that a magazine ban is a lower bar and should be more likely. While I agree it is more likely than an outright weapons ban, I'd say not by much. Second amendment supporters are likely to view any kind of gun control legislation as a slippery slope.
