It is either of their game, but Biden has the upper hand on this one, the next few days are critical to watch to see if Biden can manage to hold on to his support.  While Steyer polls well, his actual support in Nevada was around half what polls predicted due the fact that he's not perceived as a viable candidate, i.e. hasn't received any delegates or much media attention or even done well. Therefore, a similar outcome should be expected in South Carolina where the polls for his support are in fact over inflated. Moreover, after an initial surge in support show in the polls, Steyer seems to have reached a threshold as he remains unable to poll above 20% sticking to around the mid to high teens for the past month, these aren't winning numbers and they shouldn't be expected to improve in the next week.  Nobody else polls remotely well enough to come out ahead of Biden or Bernie. Buttigieg should be watched, but it remain exceedingly unlikely for him to more than double his support in South Carolina, especially considering how he wasn't able to do it in Nevada in two weeks and has consistently lacked support of blacks and Latinos on election day. Moreover, after another 4th place finish in Nevada, even Warren's firey debate performance was not enough to resurrect her dying campaign.

The South is generally less predisposed to the progressive ideas of Warren and Bernie and more disposed to moderates. Therefore, Biden has always appealed to South Carolina and has lead every poll above the margin of error, frequently by double digits and often times by more than 20 points. While Biden's campaign has certainly stumbled in Iowa and will not recover in time for New Hampshire, South Carolina in far enough away for Biden to recover and flood the state with money to \"reverse\" his negative momentum. In this way South Carolina is Biden's bulwark and his campaign is going to assuredly spend the time and money to keep it that way.  Bernie has moderate support and presence in South Carolina, but there simply aren't enough progressives in the South to give Bernie a win in South Carolina.  The real wild card in Tom Steyer, who has strategically been spending his campaign money and time in South Carolina as his breakout state. Interestingly, Steyer seems to be pulling most of his support away from Warren. He may also been seen as an alternative to Biden, but ultimately, he is too progressive to really steal Biden's support. However, it remains unlikely that he'll win.  Buttigieg, the recent darling of the primary, has strategically little to no presence in South Carolina, as most candidates realize the impracticality of beating Biden here, also Buttigieg's sexual orientation will be a real turn off for many more socially conservative southern democrats. Therefore Buttigieg will no be winning South Carolina. Warren also has little to no presence or support and will not be winning much of anything in South Carolina. Especially considering how her support dwindled since the New year.  The ultimate Wild card, will be if Biden suspends his campaign after a resounding defeat in Nevada, but this is also highly unlikely, as strategically Biden should use South Carolina as a bulwark and his campaign is so high profile that they will want to stay in till South Carolina as a gauge for Biden's appeal for the South, because if Biden can win resoundingly win the South then he has a chance in a contested convention.  However, Biden's stumble might be enough to lower the enthusiasm of his voters, decreasing his turnout in South Carolina to the point where the \"second place\" winner might be able to take over. This is really where the South Carolina race is at, who can come in second and at this point it is statistically either Bernie or Steyer,  "], [691, "2020-02-07T15:17:13Z", [0.65, 0.17, 0.01, 0.06, 0.11], ""], [14107, "2020-02-07T14:38:06Z", [0.41, 0.43, 0.02, 0.05, 0.09], ""], [78237, "2020-02-07T14:00:56Z", [0.47, 0.27, 0.07, 0.08, 0.11], ""], [1333, "2020-02-07T13:47:56Z", [0.65, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [84773, "2020-02-07T09:18:31Z", [0.57, 0.37, 0.05, 0.01, 0.0], "Looking at gambling odds which imply a roughly 60% probability for Biden and 40% for Sanders.
