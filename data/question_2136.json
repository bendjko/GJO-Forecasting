There are a lot of JWST-specific risks still in the future, but those are about mechanical deployment after launch. So what's left is, \"Can a crate be successfully shipped from California to French Guiana, successfully be loaded on to an Ariane 5, and the Ariane 5 successfully launch?\" I don't think there's a lot of risk in the basics of transporting a crate on-schedule. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm estimating that at 0%. There's one case in Ariane 5 history of a launch being delayed because of difficulty getting the payload on the rocket, because of a barricade built by striking workers. There currently isn't a labor dispute, so I consider that effectively 0% right now. Of the last question, there are essentially three kinds of risk involved: 1) Rocket failure in flight. The Ariane 5 has a 105/110 lifetime launch success rate, with 95/96 since the early teething was over. 2) Weather preventing launch. There are substantial daily launch windows for the JWST mission, so this is effectively 0% 3) Chance of some anomaly with the rocket detected before launch that requires the delay/cancellation of the launch to repair or replace the rocket. If I trust Wikipedia's completeness on this, there are 2 such cases in Ariane 5 history.

What about the even older target date for March 2021? Well, this had been pronounced dead already since January 2020, i.e. ~15 months before [4]. The situation looks rather different now, as we are already only ~2.5 months before the target date, and no further delays have been reported yet since Sep 8. It would also seem that the last delay was actually due to Ariane 5 issues, and not of the telescope itself. Given these issues, it seems that the launch of JWST was conditional on at least one successful launch of Ariane 5 before, which would be the very first launch of the rocket in 2021 and after these issues were first detected [3]: ---------------\nAt a May 11 [2021] media event about JWST, Greg Robinson, program director for the telescope at NASA Headquarters, confirmed there were two Ariane 5 launches ahead of JWST. \u201cThey\u2019re going through the process of getting the rocket ready for the upcoming launch, the first of three,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they launch, we\u2019ll be able to launch in about four months after that.\u201d That would suggest JWST will miss its Oct. 31 launch date, although perhaps only by weeks. An Ariane 5 launch of Eutelsat Quantum and Star One D2 at the beginning of the third quarter, or early July, would allow for a launch of JWST in early November, four months later.\n---------------- Well, now this launch (Eutelsat Quantum and Star One D2) has happened successfully on 30 July 2021 [5]. And the new JWST date of 18 Dec seems consistent with the target of \"four months later\" mentioned above. It is true that the target date of 18 Dec is dangerously close to the closing date of the question (1 Jan); however [3]: ----------------\nUnlike planetary missions, JWST does not have to launch in a narrow window. \u201cWe have launch windows almost virtually every day,\u201d Bill Ochs, JWST project manager at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, said at the event. \u201cWe have multiple, multiple opportunities for launch.\u201d\n---------------- Which means that, unless some serious issue is revealed prelaunch, the mission itself can accommodate delays of just a few days. Success (or at least delays not due to the rocket itself) of the next Ariane 5 launch, scheduled for 22 Oct [6], may allow for increased confidence that the target date of 18 Dec will be met. Here is a rough summary of the last target dates and delays: - June 2018: target set for March 2021 (10-month delay) [7], target abandoned already from Jan 2020 [4] (15 months before)\n- July 2020: target set for Oct 2021 (7-month delay) [2], target abandoned from May 2021 (6 months before) [3] \n- Sep 2021: target set for Dec 2021 (1.5 month delay) [1, 8] Space News again, from May 2021 [3]: ----------------\nAt the May 11 media event, though, project officials said final preparations of the spacecraft are going well, and that it should be ready for shipment to French Guiana by late August, a schedule that would support an Oct. 31 launch. The margin in that schedule has been gradually diminishing, as expected. \u201cWhen we ship, the schedule margin will be pretty close to zero, but still on plan,\u201d Robinson said, noting there are no \u201cliens\u201d on the schedule for the remaining work before shipment. \u201cRight now we\u2019re in a really good place.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re getting pretty close to the goal line,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just need to punch it over.\u201d\n----------------- And from the official ESA announcement (Sep 2021) [8]: -----------------\nImportant milestones of the launch programme for Webb have already been passed or are approaching, such as the final mission analysis review for its launch, the shipment of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle elements from continental Europe to French Guiana, and the scheduled shipment of Webb to French Guiana by the end of September 2021.\n---------------- Seems they can do it, but *our* window is really narrow... -----------------\n[1] https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-december-2021\n[2] https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/nasa-now-targeting-halloween-2021-for-launch-of-james-webb-telescope/\n[3] https://spacenews.com/ariane-5-issue-could-delay-jwst/\n[4] https://www.space.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-grim-gao-report.html\n[5] https://www.arianespace.com/mission/ariane-flight-va254/\n[6] https://www.rocketlaunchschedule.com/arianespace-ariane-5-eca-ses-17-syracuse-4a/\n[7] https://www.space.com/41016-nasa-delays-james-webb-space-telescope-2021.html\n[8] https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Targeted_launch_date_for_Webb_18_December_2021"], [56265, "2021-09-24T21:13:07Z", [0.61], ""], [96828, "2021-09-24T21:06:02Z", [0.48], ""], [99993, "2021-09-24T20:58:45Z", [0.93], ""], [40636, "2021-09-24T20:50:12Z", [0.5], ""], [96678, "2021-09-24T20:50:05Z", [0.8], "- Arianespace had a successful launch in July and has another launch scheduled for October, so I'll take the base rate of 3/25 years that the Ariane 5 has had to delay launches plus the ~3% failure rate, for a total of 15%.\n- Landsat launch on a similar rocket was delayed because of fuel supply chain issues, but (so far) only by one week.
