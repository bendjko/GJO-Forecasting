Abolishing the Senate may be more popular, although the proposal is likely prompted by the fact that the would-be Prez-for-Life and the Senate don't play nicely together at the moment.  The proposed new flag is quite nice and there is no compelling reason not to adopt it, but the flag design is not in the Constitution, so approving a change wouldn't be a constitutional amendment anyway.  The more interesting issue is posed by Title XI,  Article 99, of the current Constitution: \"Each  Bill  of  revision  must  be  voted  by  a  majority  of  two-thirds  (2/3)  of  the  Deputies\ncomposing  the  National  Assembly  and  two-thirds  (2/3)  of  the  Senators  composing\nthe Senate, to be able to be submitted to referendum . \"No  procedure  of  revision  of  the  Constitution  can  be  engaged  if  it  jeopardizes. . .  \nthe principle of democratic alternation in power and its corollary, the principle according\nto which the mandate of the President of the Republic is of five years, renewable one sole time, as specified in Articles 26 and 28 above.\" So either the proposed referendum can't be binding or it can' t be legal, since the Senate didn't buy into it and it changes things the Constitution says can't be changed.   One supposes the referendum will go forward anyway, and the President will say some things about it that aren't true.
