Dear President Tusk,   On 23 June, last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans.  Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states.  On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper.  Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe \u2013 and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.   Earlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.  The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.   Today, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom\u2019s intention to withdraw from the European Union.  In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom\u2019s intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.   This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty\u2019s Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy \u2013 as your closest friend and neighbor \u2013 with the European Union once we leave.  We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.      It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.   The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union \u2013 and indeed from third countries around the world \u2013 as much certainty as possible, as early as possible (para. 1-7).

The European Parliament is drafting a resolution to respond to May's notice of withdrawal under Article 50 of the EU treaty. Senior lawmakers said it would stress London could still halt the process, as long as the other member states agreed. The resolution text is not yet final but the intent is to strengthen the hand of those in Britain who want to halt Brexit. \"We do not want to close the door to common sense,\" Philippe Lamberts, Belgian co-leader of the Greens in the parliament, told reporters. A member of the Brexit team in the legislature, which will have to approve an exit treaty, Lamberts added: \"There will be a reference to the revocability of Article 50.\" Elmar Brok, a member of the team from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, also said there was such a reference in the draft resolution, to be agreed by party leaders on Wednesday and put to a vote in the legislature next week. Insisting Britain can U-turn enters hazy legal territory. It defies May, who says the process cannot be halted despite Brexit opponents' hopes of a new referendum or British parliamentary vote. And although EU officials disagree with May and have said the process can be stopped, with the consent of all states, they do not welcome Brussels lawmakers' bid to revive the issue (para. 1-7).

The ties that have bound the U.K. to the EU since 1973 will start to unravel at around 1:30 p.m. in Brussels when Britain\u2019s ambassador hands EU President Donald Tusk a hand-signed letter from Prime Minister Theresa May invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the legal exit mechanism. May will address lawmakers in London at about the same time. Nine months since Britons unexpectedly voted to leave, the phony war of what Brexit might look like will turn into a real battle over the complex terms of a settlement with 27 other governments. Enough lines over money, trade and immigration have been drawn to suggest a tough process with costs to both sides. \"We\u2019re moving from a U.K. monologue to a hard negotiation,\u201d said Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, a consultancy, and a former official in the U.K. Foreign Office. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be many upsets along the way\" (para. 1-4).

May will send a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk on Wednesday to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Tusk will then send draft negotiating guidelines to the 27 other member states within 48 hours. That means it will finally be down to business after an at times painstakingly slow drawing of battle lines. Britain appears to have set its course for a \"hard Brexit\", where a clean break is favored to regain control over immigration, while the EU's chief negotiator this week spelled out its need for early agreements on citizens' rights, money and borders. But May has revealed little of her strategy to secure what she calls \"the best possible deal\" for the world's fifth-largest economy.

As EU leaders insisted they are fully prepared for the Brexit talks, they canceled provisional plans to hold a summit on April 6 to agree on the outlines of their negotiating position, indicating May\u2019s announcement that she will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29 comes too late for that. The summit will be arranged for the end of April or early May, eating into the U.K.\u2019s two-year negotiation period. With disagreement between the U.K. and the EU already evident on such issues as Britain\u2019s financial commitments, the structure of the talks themselves and how much a future trade deal can be wrapped up inside two years, European policy makers warned the British government that it must have realistic expectations as it leaps into the unknown.

May is due to trigger Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, beginning two years of formal divorce talks, by the end of this month, and her office said she would be visiting Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to hear people's views. Last year's Brexit referendum exposed splits that could threaten the unity of the UK, with Scotland and Northern Ireland delivering pro-EU majorities but finding themselves outvoted by the English and Welsh, who were in favor of leaving the bloc. In a sharp challenge to May, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week she would be pushing for a fresh independence vote after having been met by \"a brick wall of intransigence\" in London when seeking for Scotland to have its own Brexit deal. May rebuffed that, saying now was not the right time. Northern Ireland's largest Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein has also said it wants a referendum on splitting from the United Kingdom \"as soon as possible\" to unite with the Republic of Ireland (para. 1-5).

During a summit of the remaining 27 EU members in Brussels on Friday, leaders were told to expect London to trigger exit talks next week and to prepare for a Brussels gathering on April 6 to respond to Britain\u2019s formal letter of notification. One UK government official involved in the process said he \u201choped\u201d that Article 50 could begin on Tuesday when Mrs May is due to address the House of Commons, but would certainly start by the end of the week. Donald Tusk, the EU Council president, said that other European capitals would be ready to issue draft \u201cguidelines\u201d for negotiations within 48 hours. The EU is \u201cwell prepared for all procedures\u201d, he said, at the conclusion of a meeting at which Europe\u2019s political elite continued fleshing out plans for life without the UK in the bloc. Aware that the long wait for Article 50 may soon be coming to an end, EU leaders also threw down some markers on how complex they expect the exit talks to be. Charles Michel, Belgium\u2019s prime minister, said that \u201cthere will be difficult discussions on all subjects but also on the financial aspects\u201d of Britain\u2019s departure. \u201cThe British did not make a good choice.\u201d Mrs May faces votes in both houses of parliament on Monday which are likely to give her the authority to begin Brexit. The prime minister will make a statement to parliament on this week\u2019s Brussels summit on Tuesday, a day later than usual, prompting speculation that she may use the moment to start the two-year negotiation period (para. 1-8).

May, who will trigger Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty to launch two years of divorce talks later this month, was keen not to linger on her plans for some of the most complicated negotiations Britain has faced since World War Two. At a meeting held in the shadow of Brexit but dominated by more immediate concerns like re-electing the EU summit chairman, May set out to show her fellow leaders that Britain was still a reliable member, despite choosing \"a different path\". She offered suggestions on everything from countering Russian \"disinformation\" to tackling organized crime - topics that helped her to underline Britain's contribution in areas like security and intelligence. Underlying her arguments was an implicit reminder to her partners in the upcoming negotiations that the UK has strengths that they need. \"At this summit, we've shown once again how Britain will continue to play a leading role in Europe long after we have left the EU,\" she told reporters, announcing for example that she would boost security cooperation and host a summit for the Western Balkans. But on the EU's most pressing question - the timing of triggering Article 50 - she gave little away, only reiterating that she would launch the talks by the end of this month (para. 1-7). Piper, E.

Its anxiety has little to do with the continuing parliamentary debates over the bill to allow the government to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty: Despite two defeats in the House of Lords, senior officials are confident that Article 50 will be triggered as planned by the end of this month. Instead, what is really unnerving Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government is the very real possibility that the Brexit negotiations will collapse before they have properly begun, leaving the U.K. to crash out of the EU in 2019 with no deal. If the European Union continues to insist that it won\u2019t discuss a new trade relationship until the U.K. agrees to an expensive divorce deal, Mrs. May really will walk away, British officials say. The U.K. government is adamant that both deals\u2014divorce and trade\u2014must be negotiated in parallel. Downing Street has grounds for being rattled, because there is little sign the EU has any intention of giving way. True, the U.K. has some allies. Some senior figures in the German finance ministry, for example, believe the EU should, after a suitable delay, start discussing future trade ties with the U.K. But in the German Chancellery, which calls the shots and appears to have prepared for Brexit almost as intensively as the British government, officials are sticking to the EU script. There is frustration at what some in Berlin see as \u201cdeliberate misconceptions\u201d being promoted by the U.K. government, including playing down the complexity of the divorce negotiations. This goes well beyond questions of the money required to settle outstanding obligations, which Brussels has suggested could be as much as \u20ac60 billion ($63 billion). A deal will be needed to allow the grandfathering of regulatory arrangements to ensure British goods and services can still be traded in the EU. The U.K. will also need agreement on the terms of its continued participation in various EU projects, such the Horizon 2020 research-funding program. And a deal will be needed on the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and British expatriates in the EU (para. 1-4). Nixon, S. (2017). U.K.\u2019s Brexit Walkout Threat Leaves EU Unmoved.

What Do the EU Nations Really Want? Wishart, Groendahl, and Simon (2017) March 8, states that: From safeguarding citizens\u2019 rights to protecting their national economic interests, European Union governments are sharpening their red lines while maintaining general unity as Theresa May prepares to formally withdraw the U.K. from the bloc. With less than a month to go before the British prime minister triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start two years of divorce negotiations, a Bloomberg News analysis shows that, while the EU\u2019s 27 other governments have differing priorities, they remain united in wanting Michel Barnier, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator, to drive a hard bargain. Brexit isn\u2019t on the agenda of a two-day summit of EU leaders starting on Thursday in Brussels, but it will be the elephant in the room (para. 1-2). Reflecting that, nearly nine months since Britain voted to leave, the EU\u2019s 27 other countries have added new negotiating positions and refreshed others. Some maintain they want to keep as close ties to the U.K. as possible, others can barely conceal their ambition to punish the U.K. for leaving the club. Practically all say the U.K. needs to be seen to be worse off outside the EU than in it (para. 5). Throw into the mix the likelihood of the U.K. being charged about 60 billion euros ($63 billion) for leaving, wrangling over whether it can fully escape the clutches of the European courts and the rule that it must exit the EU without any deal if it isn\u2019t concluded before the deadline, and it\u2019s not hard to see why diplomats are bracing for difficult talks (para. 5-6).

The 60-year-old - often described as \"sphinx-like\" in the British press - has revealed little in her first eight months as leader about how she will approach divorce talks with Brussels, perhaps wary of weakening her hand.

She did not backtrack an inch and forced it through parliament. Her conduct and strategy present a picture of a stubborn negotiator who sticks as firmly as possible to what she believes is in Britain's best interests.

Middleton (2017) Sun Feb 26, states that: Prime Minister Theresa May is set to announce that EU citizens who move to Britain after Article 50 is triggered will no longer be entitled to the automatic right to stay in the UK permanently.\nEU citizens will instead be subject to new migration curbs that will be put in place. This could possibly include a new visa scheme and restricted access to benefits, the Telegraph reports. May is set to announce the end of the free movement of EU migrants on the same day she formally triggers Article 50, which will pave the way for Brexit negotiations with the bloc. May will also hold firm to her earlier stance that EU migrants who arrived in the EU before the triggering of Article 50 will have their rights to remain protected as long as British citizens living in the bloc are giving the same protection. The newspaper said that the \"cut-off date\" is expected to be 15 March, once the government's Article 50 Bill passes through Parliament. May is also expected to ask other EU member states to reach a quick agreement on the issue of EU and British migrants in a bid to take the matter off the Brexit negotiating agenda. The paper said that the UK has reached agreements in principle with most member countries but that some countries, including Germany, have refused to discuss migration until after Brexit is triggered. The newspaper noted that while the EU wants the UK to delay any revision to rules on EU migrants to take effect in 2019, when the UK is expected formally to exit the bloc, there have been concerns that the two-year wait will only see a surge of EU migrants trying to enter the UK. A government source told the Telegraph: \"We have had some suggestion that the European Commission might attempt to force us to protect everyone who arrives up to the moment of departure [UK leaving the EU] (para. 1-9).

May and her team demand that unelected legislators in the upper house of Parliament not rewrite the 137-word European Union withdrawal bill while scrutinizing it. The premier needs Parliament to approve the law so she can start the formal Brexit process by invoking Article 50 of the EU treaty by the end of March. However, a growing number of Conservative rebels are preparing to join opposition lawmakers from the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in an attempt to defeat May in the House of Lords, which would force her to ask the elected House of Commons to vote again to undo the changes.  May\u2019s team have now told Conservatives to be ready to vote the week of March 13, with the expectation that the law will be sent back and forth as the Commons overturns changes made by the Lords, according to a person familiar with the situation who declined to be named discussing confidential plans. \u201cOur role in the House of Lords is indeed to send something back to the Commons if we think it has been decided too hastily,\u201d Ros Altmann, a Conservative legislator in the Lords, said in an interview by phone. \u201cOur function is to scrutinize this properly, not simply to toe the line\u201d (para. 1-5).

German and Italian officials say they support Michel Barnier, the chief EU negotiator, in seeking progress on divorce terms as an opening step. France is uncompromising on the estimated \u20ac60bn bill, while Spain is more wary of attempts to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain.  Such stances are preliminary, since EU member states have still to take a formal position.\n But the stance of Berlin and Rome is a blow to British ministers who are banking on Germany taking a softer approach and overruling commission hardliners. David Davis, Brexit minister, is adamant that trade talks will start in parallel with discussions on the terms of Britain\u2019s withdrawal.  EU member states take different approaches to the calculation of Britain\u2019s exit bill. Christian Kern, the Austrian chancellor, confirmed the commission\u2019s \u20ac60bn estimate. \u201cThe cheque should be around \u20ac60bn; that\u2019s what the European Commission has calculated and this will be part of the negotiations,\u201d he told Bloomberg.  The emphasis Brussels and member states now place on the exit bill also contrasts sharply with EU leaders\u2019 suggestions last summer that they were open to the idea of parallel trade talks in discussions with Theresa May, prime minister.

Ross (2017) February 15, states that: The long and short of what Prime Minister Theresa May has said about Brexit can be found in a 75-page report to Parliament, her 6,000-word speech to an audience of diplomats, and a 137-word bill. That still leaves a lot of questions unanswered as the clock ticks down on May formally triggering the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. Here is a rundown of the key points that remain unresolved. When will May trigger Article 50? Her preferred date for notifying the EU is the subject of speculation but remains a mystery. Senior government officials expect she will want to avoid clashing with the EU\u2019s planned celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the bloc\u2019s founding Treaty of Rome, on March 25. Some think May would like to make the announcement in person on March 9 or March 10 at the EU summit in Brussels. Others suggest she could make a speech in the U.K. and send the European Commission an e-mail. What could push May beyond the first couple of weeks of March is if the House of Lords amends the bill, forcing peers and lawmakers in the House of Commons to find a compromise. How will Brexit talks be structured? The commission\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants to \u201ctake things in the right order,\u2019\u2019 a signal he would prefer to deal with the divorce first, then the new relationship and save a possible transitional phase for a later stage. Doing it that way would also allow the EU to exact a price from the U.K. before deciding how much access to grant Britain to its markets. Barnier\u2019s British counterpart, David Davis, said time is so short that there must be overlap and simultaneous negotiations to finalize an agreement by October 2018 to meet a two-year deadline and to allow lawmakers in London and Strasbourg to vote. This approach would help the U.K. to horse trade. So the first topic for negotiation is likely to be the negotiations themselves. Much will depend on the mandate the 27 other governments give Barnier (para. 1-8). Ross, T. (2017). The Known Unknowns of Brexit: What Theresa May Still Won\u2019t Say. Bloomberg. Politics.

EEA Members: The passport is also extended to members of the EEA, as they adopt all EU financial laws. Hence they have 'full equivalence'. Third countries: Parts of the passporting rights can be extended to third countries, if they achieve legal/regulatory equivalence (Switzerland is a notable example). However, not all parts of EU financial legislation are covered and equivalence can also be revoked. Upon leaving the European Union, Britain would naturally have \u2018full equivalence\u2019 and would be a prime candidate for EEA membership. However, as the jurisprudence of the EFTA (which is responsible for EEA members) is based on ECJ case law and leaving the ECJ\u2019s jurisdiction is a primary goal of Brexit this is problematic. \nBritain would of course also qualify for equivalence provisions, though as mentioned above they do not cover all areas of financial legislation and can also be withdrawn, which potentially could be a major of source of uncertainty.\nIn any case, after enactment of the \u2018Great Repeal Bill\u2019 any effort to achieve equivalence will become a lot harder, as relevant legislation would need to be passed again. Of course, there is always the hope of securing a bespoke deal, which, as far as I can tell, is the UK government\u2019s current strategy. If anyone is interested in the finer details of this topic, this European Parliament Briefing provides some more colour: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/587369/IPOL_BRI(2016)587369_EN.pdf  -------- In my opinion, the only chance for a soft Brexit is a country like Germany pushing for EU concessions in a bespoke deal, as even the Switzerland model would not be compatible with some of the UK's objectives (e.g. full control of immigration, no EU laws).  However, I think the probability is low, as the EU is going to be wary of the precedent that is being set by Brexit. Any concessions on the four fundamental freedoms as prerequisites for single market access are going to cause serious issues in negotiations with member states and third countries down the line. Even then, it is important to remember, that any member state will be able to block the final deal.\nJust a couple of likely contenders:\nConsidering its enduring issues with the Catalan independence movement, Spain cannot, in my opinion, allow any deal to be too favourable, considering the precedent it would set.\nEastern member states, on the other hand, will look very closely at any immigration concessions.\nAnd then there is Belgium with its regional parliaments, which almost blocked CETA.\n(One should also remember, that some people on the EU\u2019s side of the table actually believe in the EU as a peace project and will not take too kindly to a country approaching it like a slightly better Free-Trade Agreement.) But. For all of this to be even remotely probable, there needs to be serious convergence between the EU\u2019s and the UK\u2019s negotiating positions \u2013 especially once the final exit bill (EUR 60bn?) is put to the UK. Of course, until a definitive ruling, there is always the possibility of Art. 50 being revocable (a pity, that the UK Supreme Court did not ask the ECJ for an opinion on this).

One source said that could mean a one-week delay to the law's final approval, but neither expected the process to endanger May's end of March deadline (para. 1-7). James, W. (2017).

While the British government doesn\u2019t recognize the 60 billion-euro figure, reaching agreement on the payment is crucial if the two sides are to start talking about a deal on their future relationship.\n\u201cAs all commitments are taken jointly with the other member states, if they are not paid by the U.K. the other 27 member states will have to foot the bill,\u201d Schinas said. \u201cDuring the time of its membership the United Kingdom has taken, and probably will take, financial commitments and these commitments should be honored in full.\u201d\nWhen May triggers the EU\u2019s Article 50 to officially start exit negotiations, the two sides have two years to reach a settlement and enable an orderly exit. Without a deal, the U.K. would still leave and be in a much more difficult position to strike a trading relationship with the bloc.

Based on discussions with market participants, the researchers estimate that 35 percent of wholesale banking activity in London can be attributed to dealings with customers inside the EU.\nFinancial firms will have to move that business to countries inside the trading bloc after the U.K. leaves the EU in 2019, likely spelling the end of passporting, where firms seamlessly service the rest of the single market from their London hubs. Banks, and their clients, are most concerned about a \"cliff edge\" Brexit, whereby all access is cut off after two years.\nTo safeguard against that loss of access, banks are already in discussions with European regulators about setting up new bases inside the EU and have said they will start the process of moving people within weeks of the government triggering Brexit talks, expected in March (para. 1-4).

The first will settle the divorce terms, the second future long-term trade and economic ties and the third the interim arrangements that will get the U.K. from membership to its eventual landing place.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental mistake to think there can be three deals in two years. There will be one-and-a-half deals at best,\u201d said a senior EU official.\nAs a document spelling out the EU\u2019s priorities moves toward completion in Brussels, the British government laid out its negotiating stance in more detail in a white paper published Thursday.\nLondon said it wanted to avoid \u201ca cliff edge for business or a threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new partnership with the EU.\u201d It also expressed a desire for an agreement about the future partnership after two years and a \u201cphased process of implementation.\u201d\nBoth sides admit there is no guarantee of any agreement.

The bill will be given special priority by Parliament, whose order of business is still largely controlled by ministers. While Tory MPs would like to see it fast-tracked through Parliament, many Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs will want as much time as possible to discuss a variety of issues and to make amendments. The SNP responded to the ruling by saying it would table 50 \"serious and substantive\" amendments. Labour said it too would seek to amend the bill but would not \"frustrate\" the Brexit process. However it pans out, BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy says the bill could pass through the Commons before the half-term recess in the middle of February, giving ample time for the Lords to then consider it and for it to become law before the end of March. While there are some MPs who want the process to be delayed, they are vastly outnumbered by those who want the government to get on with it so that the UK will have left the EU by the time of the next election - scheduled for May 2020. Is there any chance of Brexit being blocked? In theory, yes there is. But in reality it is extremely unlikely to happen. Few, if any, Conservative MPs are likely to vote against Article 50. In fact, only one - the europhile former chancellor Ken Clarke - has said he will do so.\nGiven that the Tories have a working majority of 15 in the Commons, this means that the bill is guaranteed to pass - especially since a majority of Labour MPs have said they will not stand in the way of the process and many will actually vote for Article 50. Although the Lib Dems, the SNP and some Labour MPs are likely to vote against, this will make little difference. What will be more interesting is if a coalition of pro-European Conservatives and opposition MPs join forces to win concessions, over the extent of Parliamentary scrutiny of the two-year process. Events in the Lords - where the government does not have a working majority and there are 178 non-affiliated cross-bench peers - could be more unpredictable.\n\nMark D'Arcy says there are murmurings of an organised attempt to resist Article 50 and a \"doomed last stand\" by diehard Remainers. But amid warnings that any attempt to block Brexit could trigger a general election, in which the future of the Lords would be a major issue - it is likely that the skirmishes will amount to just that and the government will eventually get its way.\" \"What's Next\" \n[1] http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38721650 Overview of Ruling \n[2] http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-38720320 On the Scottish Question.

What might the verdict mean?\nWhat might the Supreme Court demand?\nThe 11 judges could rule in her favor, agreeing that she doesn\u2019t need Parliament\u2019s backing. Or they could require her to put either a motion or a bill before legislators at Westminster.\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\nA motion would be a short statement that only members of the House of Commons would be asked to vote on to signal their agreement with Brexit. A bill is a tougher proposition: both chambers of Parliament, including the unelected House of Lords, would be asked to pass a law giving May the power to pull Britain out of the EU.\nHow long would the process take?\nDebates on a motion in the Commons usually last half a day. Given the significance of the motion, Speaker John Bercow might extend that to a whole day, or even two.\nIf it\u2019s a bill, the process is much more complex. There are a series of stages in each chamber, with votes at each stage, and lots of opportunities for dissenters to propose amendments.

Nothing is impossible, but I would say there is a 99% chance this will succeed before the end of June given that they intend to be ready before the end of March. If the appeal fails (74%) then the process to pass a bill through parliament will take considerably longer. The government\u2019s preferred option is a very short (\u201cthree-line\u201d) bill that will have minimum scope for time-consuming amendments [2]. However, one of the judges has commented that rather than a short bill, an extensive replacement for the original 1972 act may be required [3]. The \u201cthree-line\u201d bill would be likely to take the government past its intended date of 31 March but the period from 24 Jan to 30 June is still over 5 months. Given that the bill will be given high priority, it would seem to have a good chance of being passed before June 30 (guess 80%). However, on such an important matter, government MPs may well vote according to their consciences and/or constituencies; since the opposition leader appears to have withdrawn a recent commitment to support the bill [4], this might reduce the chances of success somewhat within the timeframe (guess x 0.9). Overall, chance of three-line bill success before June 30 = 80% x 0.9 = 72%. The time required to replace the 1972 act is anybody\u2019s guess but I would say there is a very high chance it would take longer than 5 months (5% chance of success before June 30). Chances of three-line bill vs replacing the 1972 act are difficult to assess but I would go 60% with the three-line bill (vague but slight impressions that the other option is less likely combined with considerable pressure to deliver the \u201ceasier\u201d three-line bill option).

Any WTO country can has \"access\" to the EU single market so no deal is needed, what is important is being a member of the single market. The EU Single Market is a market to guarantee to free movement of Goods and Services, Capital and People, with the EU Court having sovereignty. Mrs May does not want the EU Court or the Free Movement, so presumably what she actually want is a trading deal with EU not the Single Market. This would seem to indicate a deal more similar to that between the EU and South Korea. \nMost experts on trade negotiations think it (a) unlikely that the EU is keen on the type of deal Mrs May wants (b) even if they are it would be very difficult to get an agreement and ratify it within the 2 year time frame between invoking A59 and Leaving the EU.\nThis is why Ivan Rodgers was reporting that a UK EU deal of this sort would take a long time to sort out.\nWithout repeating the arguments, it is easy sympathize with Ivan Rodgers  (EU Ambassador who resigned). Mrs May seems to acting like someone who is sure she knows what she is doing, when those in a position to know are pretty sure she doesn't. (She does not know what she does not know.) People with this outlook tend to do things that are illogical. So she may well  trigger A50 in the belief that a deal can be negotiated in 2 years in spite of the various EU elections.  \nThe UK Labour Party seems to be completely divided on almost every aspect of Brexit, some don't want any change to the Freedom of movement of people, but would be happy with no trade deal, other want to remain in the Customs Union but accept that the Freedom of Movement needs to be changed. \nAs I noted in a previous forecast this muddle means each time the public are told what Mrs May thinks Bexit means the pound falls, to be followed a day or two later by a statement that the media have confused the markets by not explaining Mrs May's words correctly. The \"correction\" usually takes the form of saying that remaining in the Customers Union and Single Market have not been ruled out.

We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer, so the question is what is the right relationship for the U.K. to have with the European Union when we are outside,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws, but we still want the best possible deal for U.K. companies to be able to trade in and within the EU and European companies to operate and trade in the U.K.\u201d\nA report released on Monday by the think tank Civitas outlined how U.K. exporters could be compensated if May can\u2019t strike a free trade deal. It suggested that by levying \u00a313 billion ($15.9 billion) of tariffs on European products, the government could craft an \u00a38.8 billion package of support based on research credits, cash for disadvantaged regions and cheaper energy bills.\nMay also used the interview to deny the government\u2019s plan to exit the EU is \u201cmuddled,\u201d saying she\u2019ll unveil details of her strategy in the coming weeks. On Monday, she said she didn't like the terms hard or soft Brexit  and that her plan is for an \u201cambitious\u201d deal (para. 1-6). Kennedy, S. (2017).

It covered about 14.3 million square miles (more than 37 million square kilometers), about a quarter of Earth's total land area.

He made it clear that the UK has not set up an administrative structure that is ready to negotiate after A50 is triggered nor has it yet worked out what the aims of the negotiations are. He has also stated that triggering A50 before the Dutch, French and German elections means that months will be wasted before it becomes certain who the most significant national leaders will be that need to be negotiated with. Added to this is that his knowledge of the EU will not be available and it is not known when or if his replacement will have his contacts. All these factors would seem to indicate that the A50 process could slow down. On the other hand the Brexit enthusiasts welcome his resignation because he did not show sufficient belief in the Brexit project. The have made it clear that they want people with positive attitudes (true believers in Brexit). They appear to believe in the power of positive thinking; that with the right attitude you can get what you want. If they have this attitude they may believe that triggering A50 by 31st March must be done regardless of the state of preparedness of UK and of the EU. Most of the keen Brexiteers seem to have accepted that they are unlikely to get any trade deal with the EU, in which case they probably think that having the administration and strategy in place before A50 is triggered does not matter much because negotiations will not really happen.   The next factor to be considered is the attitude of Parliament, While the Brexiteers may be keen to speed up the process many MPs will be to keener to ensure the Brexit department is set up ready to start negotiations and that they know what they are supposed to trying to achieve.  It is assumed that most MPs want to try and make Brexit as pain free as possible and I believe they would block A50 if the Brexit Dept can't show it is ready.  \nWhen it will be ready is anyone's guess.  MPs will be aware of the polls that show that 48% of the public thinks the government is doing a bad job of negotiating Brexit vs only 11% who think they are doing a good job, and that 42% think that the UK will ended up with a bad Brexit deal compared with only 22% that think the UK will get a good deal.  The poll (link below) shows the appallingly bleak view of the future that it seems Brits hold. It is difficult to square the attitudes in this poll, which seem to very clearly show that people think the UK has a worse outlook since the referendum vote (they expect to be worse off, it far more racist, far more divided), with what focus groups are reporting; that people do not regret how they voted in the referendum. I suspect a framing problem, maybe the focus groups don't want to admit that the bleak outlook is a consequence of how they voted. An interesting project for the psychologists.  My final thought for the psychologists; it strikes me that Brexit is being treated as if it is an Anglo-Saxon Quest (as per Lord of the Rings), It features the pure and innocent Brexiteer who has to fight the dragons and evil wizards of the EU. Against all the odds the Brexiteer armed only by knowing he is doing the right thing is tested by creatures that have been corrupted by the wizard, by putting wax in his ears he is able to block out the smooth talk of the experts, and against all the odds he will liberate the lands from the evil wizard.  To a rationalist its all very strange. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row\nhttp://news.sky.com/story/brexit-britain-sky-data-poll-reveals-a-nation-divided-10713985"], [3540, "2017-01-04T12:00:24Z", [0.0, 0.91, 0.09], ""], [28766, "2017-01-04T07:46:36Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3], "A slight worry has crept up on me that the UK government won't be able to go ahead with triggering Article 50 due to lack of resources and negotiating capacity.

Much of that stems from the influence wielded by her joint chiefs-of-staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, the people said.\nMay is said to have been centralizing power more than her predecessor David Cameron while grappling with the most difficult task facing a British leader since the end of World War II. Hill and Timothy are said to deny top officials access to May, with even senior ministers and security chiefs finding it difficult to get past them to schedule a meeting with the premier. Some are said to be so demoralized that they have given up trying to tell May the truth about what they think of her policies. \nMay\u2019s office said in a statement it didn\u2019t \u201crecognize this version of events\u201d and said the premier governs in an \u201cinclusive manner\u201d (para. 1-4).

The EU has suggested that the 2 year leaving period that starts with A50 is in reality 18 months to negotiate plus 6 months for all parties (the EU, the EU Parliament and the nation states) to ratify and plan to implement. They have also pointed out that ideally  the UK needs to have left the EU before the next EU Parliamentary elections due in May 2020.  David Davis has pointed out that until the French and German elections are out of the way no substantive negotiations regarding the UK's future relationship with the EU can start. May has repeated her aim to invoke A50 before 31st March. If these 3 sets of dates are taken together we would have A50 by 31st Mar 2017, but no substantive negotiations would start until (probably) the end of September 2017. As the 2 year period would end in February 2019, the negotiations would need to be complete by September 2018 (to give the 6 months to ratify). This seems to show that the period to do the negotiations would be September 2017 to September 2018, which is of course 1 year.  A few days ago Fox said that the UK might want to be in the Customs Union, and it appears that Nissan was probably told something similar. But Fox's idea is that the UK is both in a Customs Union and is free to negotiate deals with other countries for products no covered by the Customs Union. The EU does not currently have a pick-and-mix customs union with anyone so this would be a new idea for both the UK and EU. \n\nMay today said (to a Parliamentary Committee) that the negotiations will not be for the UK to fit into any existing EU formulation that comes with exiting rules and institutions (not the EU, not the EEA, not the existing Customs Union) but a totally new legal construct that is a customs union, but outside the oversight of the EU Court of Justice, that includes many relationships with EU security, research, academic organisations.  Considering that it has taken 6 months and that it will take at least another 2 months for Davis to get the ideas of what the UK wants from the negotiations formulated it requires a huge level of optimism to think that there is any chance of reaching an agreement with the EU with only 1 year of negotiations. It was painfully clear from May's answer to the Parliamentary Committee (both Remainers and Leaver) that the UK objectives are still far from thought through. Many of the UK's ideas are contradictory and totally at odds with the stated positions of the EU. (Still a lot of having cake and eating it).  For example May seemed to not grasp that businesses are not going to wait until the day before the UK leaves to find out if transitional period will apply, they need years to plan and if they are being told they might have a different relationship with the EU from April 2019 they will start moving from London in 2017. When asked what would happen if she triggered A50 and two years later no deal with the EU had been agreed, she had no answer.   One can imagine years of arguments about which products will be inside the customs union and which will not. Only a dictator could hope to knock heads together to get such a complete negotiation completed in year. So why is the UK government setting out on a project timetable that has almost zero chance of being achievable?  It could be that May really believes she can achieve it, I find it difficult to accept that. It could be that she has got caught up with events; she has got on the runaway train and does not know how to stop it without crashing. I think this is quite likely. She could be banking on external forces derailing the timetable allowing her to claim she has been stopped from delivering Brexit within her table. I think this is the most likely explanation. I think she hopes that Parliament will stop or delay the process. If it does this before A50 or not is questionable.  Judging by May's performance today I think it is highly likely that Parliament will step in. It was clear that Committee members both for Remain and Leave were not at all convinced by her answers.

Some Leavers are now insisting that the difference between \"hard\" and \"soft\" Brexit is a myth, that there is only one true Brexit. This is a silly claim which suggests that two years of negotiation will just be spent scrawling \"Brexit means Brexit\" on a piece of paper, rather than fleshing out the huge range of options we might take.\nAt least this is just misleading rhetoric, though. The Irish business is a grubby plan to circumvent the courts of the United Kingdom, and to kick the business of what Article 50 means to the European Court of Justice. One reason it is being done in Ireland is because our courts have shown no interest whatsoever in involving the ECJ.

The leader of the center-right group of MEPs, Manfred Weber, was brusque, saying there could be no cherry-picking and no special deal between the UK and the EU (para. 9).\nSpeaking to officials and politicians off-the-record in Brussels last week, I did not hear much talk about a straightforward deal cut for mutual benefit. Instead, the aim is to find an exit for Britain that makes it clear to remaining EU states they are better off in the club than out of it.\nOf course, the EU does a lot of trade with the UK and member states do not want to jeopardize that. But I was also told by officials within the EU institutions that Brexit is an existential threat to the EU that has to be dealt with firmly. That might mean a divorce deal with the UK that puts politics ahead of economics. Which is exactly what many in Brussels think Theresa May's government has done by heavily hinting the UK wants to leave the single market but have access to it.\nAs the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has already said, he thinks the choice for Britain will either be a hard Brexit or no Brexit. For the EU, it is Mr. Tusk who will lead the remaining 27 member states through the talks with UK. The nitty-gritty of negotiations will be done by the European Commission and a unit headed by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator. But it is EU states who will have the final say on that side of the table.\nThe mantra in Brussels is \"no negotiation without notification\". That means no talks with the UK until Theresa May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - a move she wants to make by the end of March 2017.\nThere is impatience in the EU for the prime minister to get on with it. As Whitehall tries to work out what it wants from Brexit, a parallel process is under way in Brussels and there is a sense of mobilization.\nBilateral meetings are happening now between the EU Council and the remaining 27 member states on how the negotiations should work. This work is being led by Didier Seeuws, who runs the European Council's Brexit taskforce. These talks are not about the substance of the negotiation or red lines but about how the EU heads of government will feed into the Commission's work during Article 50 negotiations.\nBrexit is also expected be discussed among the 27 (without the UK) on the margins of the December European Council. Soon after Article 50 has been triggered, the EU Council of 27 will meet to agree the negotiation guidelines and discuss their starting position for talks. In Westminster, it is often assumed the UK is in the driving seat for negotiations. That is not so.\nIn the European Council's view, Article 50 is there to protect the interests of the remaining 27 EU members. I do not think there is a punitive mood towards Britain but there is a widespread expectation negotiations will be tougher and more complex than the UK realizes.\nAs one Commission official told me, unlike David Cameron's renegotiation, the UK will not have any \"friends\" in these talks. Each country will try to use Brexit to their press own advantage (para. 9-17). Wright, B. (2016). Steering Britain out of the EU. BBC News. UK Politics.

This was an important moment. It has taken the Prime Minister five months to reach a conclusion that had been obvious to business groups and European Union policy experts since June 24th. Yet even now, some senior Brexit ministers still argue that a transitional deal is unnecessary, and that the entire Brexit process can be negotiated and ratified within two years. Indeed, there are influential voices in the Conservative party who question the need for any kind of exit deal at all, arguing the U.K. should simply walk away (para. 1-2). But if Brussels is convinced that an Article 50 exit deal is essential to provide legal certainty and a strong basis to agree a new relationship, no one is under any illusions that the negotiations will be easy. Much will depend on what future relationship Mrs. May says she wants to seek. That doesn\u2019t need to be spelled out in great detail when she sends her formal Article 50 notification; indeed, the letter should be kept short, says one senior official: \u201cIf it contains a list of 20 demands, we would probably end up rejecting 19 of them straight away.\u201d But clearly, the closer the ties the U.K. wants to keep with the EU, the easier\u2014and less costly\u2014the Article 50 exit terms will be (para.7). In Brussels, the assumption is that the U.K. will seek a comprehensive free-trade deal or Association Agreement. Past experience suggests that these deep deals can take several years to negotiate and would require ratification in 38 European parliaments and regional assemblies, in which case a transitional deal would certainly be necessary. There are two ways this might be achieved. One is that the new relationship is negotiated in parallel with Article 50. In this case, the U.K. would remain part of the EU until the end of the process and so would not regain sovereignty in 2019 but would continue to be subject to EU rules on free movement of people and remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The alternative is that Article 50 and the future relationship are negotiated sequentially. In this case, Commission lawyers have indicated that it would be possible for European leaders to come to an informal agreement to preserve current trading arrangements, providing neither side puts up new trade barriers for up to three years. This assumes that Mrs. May will have delivered on her pledge to introduce a so-called Great Repeal Bill, incorporating EU law into U.K. law in order to retain legal equivalence (para.7-10). Nixon, S.

Speculation about what Brexit means for biotech has been circulating since the stunning referendum result from June, but the full consequences are still only beginning to sink in. Based on recent conversations with a number of UK venture investors and biotech company CEOs, it seems that there is a growing sense of alarm. In sharp contrast to the early euphoria seen in the market for U.S. biotech company shares over the election of Donald Trump, the UK sector is preparing itself for a painful period of retrenchment.\nIt must be said that the actual separation of the United Kingdom from Europe may not happen at all, or it may happen in a way (e.g. \u201csoft Brexit\u201d) that is less of a threat to biotech and science, for example if free movement of workers, including scientists, remains unfettered. It remains likely that Britain will exit the EU in a two-year process triggered by Britain issuing Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in March 2017, as the UK government has stated. If Article 50 is indeed issued, it is considered probable that the EU will make the terms of Brexit as harsh as possible, with little protection for biotech or science. But enough powerful forces\u2013the Supreme Court, for example\u2013have yet to rule on the mechanics that one CEO called the situation \u201ca constitutional crisis.\u201d\nAssuming \u201chard Brexit\u201d moves forward, there are many concerns. Executives and investors cited threats to the flow of capital from limited partners to UK-based venture funds; to the flow of capital from EU-based funds outside the UK to UK-based companies; to the freedom of movement of employees including both scientists and non-scientists and including spouses of executives and scientists. These individuals also expressed concern about the replacement of billions of EU funds currently flowing into the United Kingdom. The European Medicines Agency and its staff of 600, based in London since 1995, is almost certain to depart. Less dire, it is believed, is the potential exit of Big Pharma companies from Britain.

So, the response to a High Court ruling on November 3rd that the government must have the approval of Parliament before initiating the Article 50 procedure for leaving the EU came as a shock. Several newspapers loudly denounced the judges for trying to subvert the referendum vote for Brexit on June 23rd. No matter that the judgment was not about whether Brexit should happen, but about the narrower question of whether the government could unilaterally invoke Article 50 using its prerogative powers to make and unmake treaties. On this issue the judges were emphatic. Because the 1972 European Communities Act that gives effect to Britain\u2019s EU membership confers domestic rights on individuals, those rights can be removed only by Parliament. Yet the government still disputes this view. On November 7th David Davis, the Brexit secretary, confirmed in the House of Commons that the government would appeal to the Supreme Court. All 11 justices will hear the case in early December; they are expected to hand down their judgment only in January. Most lawyers who have studied the High Court judgment expect the Supreme Court to concur with it. The only thing that might change this is if the court questions whether triggering Article 50 irrevocably leads to Brexit. In the High Court case, both sides assumed it would. Yet in Brussels many lawyers believe that, even though Article 50 sets a two-year deadline for a country to leave, its invocation could in practice be withdrawn at any time. Such an argument could help the government to win in the Supreme Court. Yet it does not wish to use this line, because it dislikes any suggestion that Brexit could be reversible. Furthermore, were the case to turn on this issue it could lead to an embarrassing referral to the European Court of Justice. What will happen next? The most likely outcome is delay, which may threaten the government\u2019s promise to trigger Article 50 by the end of March. If the government loses in the Supreme Court, it will surely have to introduce not a parliamentary resolution but a bill to be enacted by both houses of Parliament (para 1-4). The Economist Website.

Fran Burwell is vice president, European Union and special initiatives, at the Atlantic Council. The November 3 ruling by a British High Court that Parliament must vote before the British government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty has been seen by many as making it less likely that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. In reality, although it may slow the process, it could also lead to a much more difficult negotiation with the other EU member states and even increase the likelihood of a \u201chard Brexit\u201d in which the U.K. loses access to the single market. Assuming the Supreme Court confirms the High Court ruling in December, British Prime Minister Theresa May will be faced with two options. First, her government can send a bill to Parliament aimed at securing approval for its course of action vis-\u00e0-vis Brexit. If done under the emergency process, this would not cause a considerable delay. The government may also decide to use a resolution, rather than a bill, which can be passed in as little as a day. It is likely that Parliament\u2014both the House of Commons and the House of Lords\u2014would approve the move to Brexit despite Parliament\u2019s supposed majority in favor of remaining in the EU. The strong British sense of fair play makes it unlikely that members of Parliament would be eager to overturn the referendum and be accused of dictating to the public. More important, the Conservative government has a majority of 15 in the House of Commons, and it would undoubtedly expect all party members to support the government, whatever their own personal feelings. It should not be forgotten that Parliament is different from the U.S. Congress, which is designed to provide \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to the executive. In the U.K., MPs from the governing party are expected to support the government, and in the case of a Brexit vote the government would undoubtedly insist on that support, with strong penalties for any dissenters (para. 1-7).

This question is driving me insane. Government seems to be changing legal strategy, claiming A50 could be revoked after triggered, therefore does not remove rights of British citizens directly. Say there's a 50% chance the Supreme Court accepts this argument and overturns High Court. In that scenario I think the chances of A50 in March are essentially 100%. That leaves 50% chance SC agrees with HC and Parliament must vote before triggering A50. The fact that government is changing legal strategy suggests it wants to avoid Parliament voting, i.e. it isn't sure it can get them to vote in its favor. Let's say 20% chance of Parliament voting to trigger A50 in time for March deadline. That makes 50% + 50% * 20% = 60% chance of March A50.

If elections happen early enough, mid-2017 remains a possibility for Art 50. \n - Consolidation Act before Art 50: dropping that. No one discusses it, there must be obstacles.\n - parliamentary discussion/vote on a short bill: apparently the government is working on that. Raising the probability of this to happen before mid-2017 to 75% (still conditional on no overturn (85% now) and no elections (90%)). If they do it early enough, there is time for discussion. But Parliament may still want more than the government is willing to deliver in terms of negotiating position specifics.  All this gets me to 75/25.

May's plans to start the formal divorce procedure from the European Union by the end of March were dealt a blow last week when England's High Court ruled that her government must seek parliamentary approval for triggering Article 50. May wants government, not parliament, to shape Britain's approach to leaving the EU and has said she will appeal the ruling in Britain's highest court - a stance her ministers and aides stuck to on Monday, avoiding any comment on the report. Sky News quoted sources as saying the government was preparing a bill, legislation that will have to be considered in both houses of parliament in what could be a lengthy process and potentially delay May's timetable. May's spokesman told reporters the government was focused on winning its appeal to the Supreme Court next month and meeting the March deadline - an argument repeated by her minister responsible for Brexit, David Davis (para. 1-5).

Either the UK Government is totally inept or trying to be cunning. Surely they must have anticipated the High Court ruling.

Why has she wasted  4 months and appears to be planning to waste at least another month (possibly 2) appealing the High Court? Why is the consolidation of 1972 into English law being put off until after A50? Logically it should be done first. Delaying it seems to offer another possibility of intervention by the High Court on the ground that triggering A50 but failing to pass the Consolidation before automatic Brexit 2 years later would result in many laws being subject to neither the EU Court of Justice nor any English Court. There is no guarantee that having triggered A50 that the Consolidation Act would be able to be passed. Nissan may be happy with Mrs May saying \"Trust me\", I am not sure that the High Court would. It is all very well to tell the EU that she is sticking to the timetable, but does she know that \"events\" will force her to miss the date. It makes no sense to trigger A50 just before the French election, it just means 3 months of zero progress. Are all her recent actions aimed at zero progress? Was the selection of Heathrow for a 3rd runway knowing that it is incompatible with meeting pollution targets, just a way of not building anything? She has form. At the Home Office she made a lot of noise about reducing immigration from outside the EU, but in 6 years actually achieved nothing. Maybe her plans are to talk things up, but avoid the tough decisions needed to deliver. And Brexit is going to be tough to deliver.

It may also remove the need for the government to elaborate on its negotiating position beyond general principles.

The only arrangements that appear to match his description would be the EU Customs Unions (on a similar basis to Turkey) or the EU Single Market (like Norway). He also spoke of the need to have similar arrangements for other industries and services.  He and May appear to have done a remarkable job of convincing Nissan, that a few weeks previously had said it would not invest in its UK plant without compensation in case tariffs were introduced on Brexit. Bearing in mind that compensation for tariffs is illegal under WTO and EU rules, the UK government seems to be very committed now to the Single Market or the Customs Union. In both cases there exists a more or less standard agreement to sign up to, which it is unlikely that the rest of the EU would object to. But as May and Clerk must be aware both these options preclude the EU making 3rd party trade deals without EU agreement and they both require that the EU Courts enforce the EU set rules. It does not really seem feasible that any agreement like Clerk was describing could operate without a common set of rules and a Court of some kind to deal with disputes. We know the sort of time it takes to create a bespoke trade deal (7 to 10 years seems typical). The UK will (probably) only have two years to do its deal with the EU. So I would suggest that the only possible deal that could be done in 2 years would be to take an existing EU deal such as the Customs Union or Single Market. Maybe with the long term objective of gradually changing it. But in order to do that I am sure that the UK could only get a variation of the Freedom of Movement for Workers and would still need to contribute to the EU budget. The alternative would be no deal at all. Would May be willing to tell Nissan and the motor industry and any other industries that had also been \"assured\" that there would be no financial or other tariffs that the UK had turned down an offer from the EU for staying in the Customs Union or Single Market? How could the UK \"compensate\" them? I would not like to be in her shoes if she did not bring a tariff free deal from Brussels. I think \"assuring\"  Nissan that May can deliver has made it impossible not to.  And that only an existing agreement can be used in the time frame. That said it would be better to get the uncertainty out of the way and start the process by March. As the issue of immigrants has already blurred into not counting the skilled, graduates, students and vital unskilled workers, it should not be impossible to sort out an acceptable fudge.

The leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right bloc in the European Parliament took to the BBC's flagship news show during last week's summit to warn Britons that such awkward tactics risk poisoning May's efforts to cut the kind of divorce deal she wants, keeping trade ties while curbing immigration. \"That is creating a lot of anger,\" Manfred Weber said of British opposition to new plans for EU defense cooperation that London says might hamper NATO. \"Please don't block it because that would have a lot of impact on the Brexit negotiations.\"\nAcknowledging Britain retains veto powers and votes in the EU for now, Weber said: \"It's a question of behavior, whether you respect each other, not a question of rights.\" (para. 1-8) Newsweek Website.

Obviously a Byelection is not a General Election, but the the Government has only a small majority and there must be a lot of Conservative MPs who are worried about the next election. Governments tend to get fewer votes in Byelections, but new Governments don't usually loose popularity so quickly. The fact that this Government has lost votes indicates that what is doing is not popular with Conservative voters. In these circumstances MPs become keener on improving their election chances than blindly supporting the Government. Crashing the economy has not previously been a popular policy with Conservative voters, so MPs will want to ensure that Brexit is done so as not to cause too much damage.  \nMore reports from the BBC on divisions and confusion within the UK Government.

That was one of the High Court\u2019s first questions in oral arguments on Oct. 13.  Also, Donald Tusk has indicated that the UK could withdraw Article 50 notice if they are not pleased with the outcome of the Brexit negotiations with the EU.  On the legal side, my understanding is that the UK court (either the lower court currently hearing the case--called \u201cHigh Court\u201d-- or the UK Supreme Court when the case is appealed) can \u201ccertify the question\u201d to the Court of Justice of the EU.  This means the UK court can ask that the EU court answer the question of whether Article 50 notice can be withdrawn and, if so, how that is accomplished because these are questions of European law, not UK law. The UK court can certify the question if the answer affects the domestic law issue of whether Parliament must pass legislation to invoke Art. 50.   One might wonder if this sort of punting of the question to another court is unusual.  In the United States, federal courts regularly certify questions of state law to the relevant state supreme court, wait for the answer, and then proceed with the rest of the federal case.  The idea behind it is that the other court is in a better position to make the decision on that particular issue.  Also, in the Brexit case, the UK courts are not in a position to enforce against the EU an interpretation made by the UK court about EU law.  That is key.  This decision must be made in a way that binds the EU to the interpretation. Possible legal outcomes:  1.  High Court rules, appeal to UK Supreme Court follows with no EU court involvement. 2.  High court certifies question to EU Court and waits on ruling from EU Court before ruling on UK issues.  An appeal to UK Supreme Court on Parliament involvement is possible. 3.  High court rules without certifying, appeal to UK Supreme Court follows.  Supreme Court certifies the question to EU Court and waits on ruling from EU Court before deciding UK legal questions.   If UK Supreme Court rules for Parliament\u2019s involvement, then that will add more hurdles to the Article 50 notice.   I am still researching and learning about this issue because it came to my attention after reading some of last week\u2019s court transcripts and Tusk\u2019s speech.  The idea that a third court (or more?  Not sure about any appeal process with the EU court) could now become involved in the Brexit litigation could mean further delay.   For more info, see  1.  Thursday morning\u2019s oral arguments:  https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/20161013-am.pdf 2.  Text of Tusk\u2019s Speech Oct. 13:  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/10/13-tusk-speech-epc/ Last paragraph:  The brutal truth is that Brexit will be a loss for all of us. There will be no cakes on the table. For anyone. There will be only salt and vinegar. If you ask me if there is any alternative to this bad scenario, I would like to tell you that yes, there is. And I think it is useless to speculate about \"soft Brexit\" because of all the reasons I've mentioned. These would be purely theoretical speculations. In my opinion, the only real alternative to a \"hard Brexit\" is \"no Brexit\". Even if today hardly anyone believes in such a possibility. We will conduct the negotiations in good faith, defend the interests of the EU 27, minimise the costs and seek the best possible deal for all. But as I have said before, I am afraid that no such outcome exists that will benefit either side. Of course it is and can only be for the UK to assess the outcome of the negotiations and determine if Brexit is really in their interest. Paraphrasing Hannah Arendt's words: \"a full understanding of all the consequences of the political process is the only way to reverse the irreversible flow of history\".  3.

As I understand it A50 gives a country up to 2 years to complete its negotiations to leave the EU. At the end of the two years EU treaties shall cease to apply to the Leaving country. \nTherefore it appears to be the case that if the EU invoked A50 in March 2017 all EU Treaties will cease to apply by March 2019 at the latest. I would have thought that if the EU Treaties were just allowed to lapse there would be legal chaos. Hence the need for the Consolidation Law to convert EU law into UK law. But the only way to guarantee that the Consolidation Law is in fact passed before the UK leaves the EU is to pass it before triggering Article 50. Not passing the Consolidation Law before triggering Article 50 appears to be relying on future legislation, which the government may expect to pass, but that there is no way of knowing will pass. Therefore it would appear that in order to protect UK Citizens as well as Citizens of other UK countries legally residing in the UK (who presumably could after March 2017 be classified illegal aliens) A50 has to come after the Consolidation bill. I would assume that many other rights that are provided by EU law would disappear. \nIt does not sound right for the Royal Prerogative  (A50) to be used in such a way that Parliament is forced to pass future legislation like it or not.

Other statement made at the Conservative Party Conference have indicated that the government appears to be trying to change the direction of the Conservative Party. The cumulative effects have penned up cracks between the views of the government and some Conservative MPs. Coupled with this Labour has appointed Keir Starmer as the Shadow Brexit Minister. These developments appear to be adding impetus the idea that Mrs May cannot be left to dictate the UK's objectives as to what type of Brexit the UK wants and then to lead the negotiations with the EU with the public and MPs denied any input or veto on what the final deal entails. Today several political commentators have expressed doubts that Mrs May's tactics are sustainable. Starmer talked of raising the matter in Parliament. Given that the government has a majority of only 12 it is possible that parliament could demand its say and delay May's timetable. May seems vulnerable as she has also raised  policies not directly linked to Brexit, that while popular with party members were not party policy and that are not popular with all her MPs (e.g. Grammar Schools, reporting how many foreigners are employed by each company). She has had her 100 days of honeymoon. It will now be business as usual trying to get all her MPs to follow her when they are not at all happy that they want to go there.

It has been suggested that saying that the UK is prepared for no access to EU markets could be just a negotiating ploy, but her problem is that by suggestion that this could be a likely outcome has had other consequences. The pound has resumed its fall and businesses that can relocate are no doubt pursuing plans to obtain the premises inside the EU, and affected business that can't easily more plant and machinery will have stopped investing in the UK.  The effect of the talk of plans to replace foreign workers with British workers although not yet implemented, added to the drop in incomes as expressed in Euros or Dollars of the foreign workers, will be starting to effect the recruitment and retention of these workers - working in the UK for less money compared to other countries, while be made to feel unwelcome is not great for attracting talent. We are seeing a significant split in what what government ministers and others are saying the Brexit vote was for. One group is saying its about Free Markets, Free Trade and against protectionism, the other group are saying its about protect people from Globalisation. Its very unclear how the border with Ireland can be kept fully open if the UK is outside the EU Customs Union. I would expect the consensus that the government is free to do any deal it likes with the EU will break down in the next few months as more groups of people question if the government intends delivering a deal with the EU that will match what they want. This division will particularly affect those who voted for Brexit, but don't want what ever type of Brexit the government appears to favour.

Clearly there is pressure on Mrs May to show that progress is being made on Brexit. In my opinion these announcements are more to do with giving the appearance of progress  than actually making progress. They relieve the pressure. There is no urgency to repeal the 1972 Act as Mrs May has said it will not be operative until the UK actually leaves the EU, which if A50 is invoked in early 2017 would not be until early 2019. There are several things that could (conveniently) delay the time table. It is not obvious that it would be easy to get the repeal act through parliament.  The Conservatives have a small majority in the Commons and no majority in the Lords. It could be that MPs (or Lords) will want more control over the terms of any Brexit deal and will not want to pass the repeal act without knowing what the Brexit terms will be or having a parliamentary vote on triggering A50 or the final Brexit deal. A delay to the repeal act could be used as a reason for delaying invoking A50. It remains odd deciding to invoke A50 a few weeks before a French Presidential election when the candidates for that election have already started to come up with widely different ideas about the kind of deal they would offer the UK. (It is the members of the EU that tell the UK what the terms of Brexit will be). Another reason for delay of A50 could be that Davis has not got his act together by next March and is not ready. Note; Mrs May can blame Davis and his team. \nOn the other hand the motor industry and the banks will be increasingly actioning contingency plans regarding relocating their businesses but repealing the 1972 act and invoking A50 will not actually make the terms of Brexit any clearer, so presumably they will continue with their plans regardless until the actual terms of Brexit are agreed. \nSo I have modified my forecast, but I take what Mrs May says with a pinch of salt.

And the boss of Nissan says in order to invest in Nissan UK he would expect compensation if the UK has no freetrade deal with the EU.\nThe second link says there will be free trade with the EU, and in case their is not it does not really matter because the UK can have freetrade with Australia and others. Wanting something to happen is not the same as having evidence that it is going to happen. Freetrade is a good liberal ideal. In the 19th century Britain was powerful enough to force it on much of the world (often with the help of gunboats). In the 21st century you need multilateral trade deals. These trade deals, in order to satisfy voters, require to cover more than trade. They need to cover standards, they need to cover courts of arbitration, they need to cover the environment, they need to cover employment standards. I don't hear Fox talking about any of these aspects.  \nIn a previous version of the second article Fox was quoted as saying that the UK would have left the EU before the next election in 2020, which would presumably mean A50 invoked before Jun 2018. \nMy conclusion is that as others have said, Brexit is a shambles and seems to be being run by people who are delusional (as Clegg says in the second article) . \nThese delusions are of course the same ones that were peddled before the vote. The difference is that the Brexit team then said that these agreements would be easy, now they admit agreement will be hard. \nWould any rational person risk A50 is these circumstances? \nTo make any progress on Brexit Fox, Johnson. and Davis need to be fired and some rational negotiators who don't start with the impediments of being regarded as untrustworthy jokers by the world.

Car makers have a much bigger problem in that you can't move a car plant as easily as you can move a desk, but they will not want to have to write off the newer car plants. (My guess is that GM will use Brexit as an excuse to abandon UK manufacturing), the others will want a deal that gives them access to the EU, which means that some sort of deal on retaining at least some of the freedom of movement is needed. \nThe benefits of having immigrants is slowly being recognised; do the Brexit people really believe that redundant bankers and car workers will take over emptying bed pans in care homes, and picking vegetables in Boston? \nAs the months go by a choice between a slow decline as businesses relocate or stay but stop investing because of the uncertainty and A50 with no deal with the EU being in prospect which will produce a fast decline at the end of 2 years.

Downing Street said Mrs May was not committed to any timetable for activating Article 50 of the EU treaty, which sets the clock ticking on a two-year negotiating period to complete exit talks. https://www.ft.com/content/84f4f9e4-80ee-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4"], [27199, "2016-09-23T05:19:37Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25], ""], [484, "2016-09-23T01:49:08Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "Middle bucket up 20@ on statements about sooner rather than later.

There are reports in the news that suggest that the UK will not have prepared its negotiating position early next year or that it will be unwilling to trigger it waiting for the German and French elections first [Source:http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/14/theresa-may-tells-feuding-ministers-to-stop-playing-games-and-ge/]. However, the UK government will find it hard to find reasons for delaying it further - David Cameron had said that would invoke it immediately, but he resigned instead - for another 6 months. This will simply not be accepted by the Leavers. Moreover, EU states have mentioned that they want a fast resolution and will exert pressure in that direction. The UK will appear that it cannot or will not proceed with the Brexit because it cannot make it and is also ignoring the wishes of its people.  There is also another possibility, and that is to find a formula to put the Brexit question to the public again. It is clear that most of the establishment, the financial experts and a significant part of the private sector are against Brexit, as well as almost half of those that voted. Moreover, the SNP in Scotland is examining options on how to stay in the EU and/or leave the UK. No matter what the benefits expected to come from Brexit, they will not come any time soon, which may affect voters who vented their frustration by voting for Brexit or are having second thoughts from not seeing what was promised. As there is not clarity on what Brexit means, it is possible that the government will hold a second referendum asking the voters to decide what kind of Brexit they wish, and throwing in the question at the same time \" Are you really sure that you want to leave the EU?\". This can be done in conjunction with the EU giving way to some of the demands (or at least appear to), although it is hard to see how they can circumnavigate the migration issue. Second referenda have been held in Denmark and Ireland on EU issues, although not on the \"stay or go\" type.

It is reported that officials do not expect article 50 invoked before late 2017.\nThere is little evidence that the Brexit team  have any understanding of how complicated Brexit will be. So far May is adopting a classic strategy of letting the Bexiteers tangle themselves in knots. The Brexit team are implausibly claiming that the Leave vote has not (yet) caused any harm to the UK (I don't think many of the much derided \"experts\" said it would have wrecked the UK in the first seven weeks, it would take 2 to 5 years after the UK left the EU to hit the bottom). But the warning signs of damage are visible; a lower pound, lower credit rating, lower business activity, lower job vacancies, lower interest rates. In my opinion May is planning to keep saying \"Brexit means Brexit\" while it becomes increasingly obvious that what the Brexit crew promised was a delusion and what Brexit really means is an economic disaster and social catastrophe. Only when the Brexit team eat humble pie and admit they cannot deliver anything that they promised will May ask the public (or Parliament)  if they still want to invoke article 50.

And yet consensus is currently ~5% \"before 1 Jan 2017\". It's less obvious that it won't happen in the first semester of 2017, but again, current consensus is that it is MORE LIKELY to happen in S1/2017 than not, which given the complexities of the process also seems NUTS. Here is the opinion of a minister who actually went through the process of taking a country out of the European Union --- and a much smaller, simpler country at that, namely Greenland: \" 'Negotiating Greenland\u2019s exit was a fairly simple task that resulted in a relatively simple and easy to understand protocol,' Ellemann-Jensen told Bloomberg. 'That took three years. Britain will take much longer.

So I am giving that zero probability.\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/28/prime-minister-says-uk-will-not-trigger-article-50-before-the-end-of-the-year.html\nhttp://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-article-idUKKCN0ZZ13S The main reason given by May and others for waiting longer is to attempt to strike a better deal for Britain with the EU.  Now the EU wants Britain to invoke immediately, so they can then reduce uncertainty and regain control of the situation.  So Britain would be foolish to begin negotiations by invoking the article, as its its their very best leverage.  They should wait until they get the best deal, and pressure the EU to give them all they could get SO they will invoke and reduce uncertainty.   So then the real question is how long negotiations would take.  Some in the EU (including the author of article 50) want to punish Britain for invocation, for obvious reasons.  But the EU really wants to eliminate uncertainty ASAP.  Britain does eventually need to leave...though there is no date certain, and that is important to remember.  Also, we have the poisoned chalace argument, where the invoker of article 50 can expect some blow-back and they will have to own that.  Also, once they invoke article 50, their negotiating leverage (and as I understand it even their voice in the EU) will be hugely reduced.  So its a bit of a hostage situation.  \nBritain:  I won't remove uncertainty and allow you full control of the process until you give me what I want.  \nEU:  We really want to punish you for causing us troubles, but don't dare (or really cannot do as much) as long as you are able to cause us continued difficulties.  \nOutcome:  So they will talk for an interminable amount of time to find some way to move on, with invocation happening only after the real negotiations have already been completed.  Therefore, the two year time frame for negotiations should be a bit of a formality, if I am reading this situation correctly.      My opinion is that negotiations may take quite a long time.  But its a tough call because many are incented to bring some closure.  So for now, I am tilted just a bit toward after July 1, 2017.   Negotiation progress (or lack thereof) will inform whether it should be sooner or later in my opinion.

The dilemma is painful. The more the UK government takes time to think through the options, educate the public, and deal with opposing views, the longer it will be before the negotiations begin and the uncertainty over the final outcome is dispelled. Yet the faster it activates the negotiations the less it will be prepared to play the game. UK political leaders presumably would prefer to take until at least the first quarter of 2017 because they need time to get organized, sort out their negotiating strategy, and build support. Further, they recognize that once Article 50 is triggered the two-year clock starts ticking and the EU gains leverage. Concluding the withdrawal process within two years will be very difficult even assuming all the homework has been done beforehand. Nevertheless, the business community will push hard for a faster timetable because of the difficulty of making decisions with policy on such  fundamental questions unresolved and the void filled by  debate, speculation, leaks, and rumors. EU leaders will meanwhile be hectoring the UK to get moving. There will be little patience for a thorough preparation process prior to triggering Article 50.

No countries have left the EU before! Surely other countries left other transnational organizations before, but I don't know any examples and it feels like they would be too different. (Involve countries which are too different, have happened in too different time periods, etc.) IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO GET A BASE RATE FOR THIS, PLEASE TELL ME! As far as I understand, one issue is that it is up to the UK to trigger A50, but doing so is to their disadvantage: once triggered, it starts a 2-year period for the exit to be negotiated (trade deals, etc). After 2 years, even if negotiations fail, the UK is out. Failed negotiations means the UK suddenly having no preferred access to EU markets; it would be an economic disaster. Thus, once A50 is invoked, the UK would be under heavy pressure to accept any trade deal proposed by the EU. There's a \"loophole\" whereby the UK can invoke A50 but take it back if negotiations aren't going its way [1]. But I predict that no UK politician would want to be seen as \"taking back Brexit\", especially not the Brexiters currently at the helm. The other notable issue I'm aware of is Scotland & Northern Ireland. They wanted to stay in the EU and now threaten secession if Brexit happens. Theresa May has said Brexit won't be triggered until there is \"an approach\" backed by Scotland [2]. Scottish leaders like Nicola Sturgeon have said very tough words about London & Brexit very publicly and very recently; in order to do a U-turn on it they need to give voters' memory time to fade. It may all be a ruse by May to buy time though. As far as specific dates, May has explicitly said she will not trigger A50 before the end of 2016 [3]. One last barometer: Nigel Farage --- among the most vocal Leave advocates, to put it mildly --- says people will be upset if \"the wishes of Leave voters are not carried out\" by 2020 [4]. That's a mighty large window, from someone you'd expect to want to rush things! And here's a good, dragonfly-eye overview of how Brexit could happen: [5]. Alright, time for probabilities. We could see either: (i) Article 50 invoked without waiting for trade deals to be ironed out;\n(ii) Article 50 invoked after there's been substantial progress on trade deals;\n(iii) Article 50 never invoked. I assign a low probability to (i); it is against the UK's interests and it is the UK who decides. I think only riots in the streets could cause (i). Still, people are dumb, so let's give this a 2% chance. At the other extreme, (iii) also feels unlikely to me; wouldn't voters be way too angry? Perhaps May & Sturgeon don't really want Brexit and are playing a game where they blame each other for not triggering A50. Years pass and voters forget. Slightly less unlikely than (i), let's call it 3%? As for (ii), it is a bit easier to get a base rate here. Trade deals are complicated things which take time to work out, often on the order of 5 or 10 years. See Farage's remark above. Even if somehow a lot of existing deals are reused, it seems VERY unlikely significant progress would be made in less than a year, no more than a 10% chance. (I'd say it's even less than 5% but the \"minister of Brexit\" has said he want to do it by early 2017 [3].) OK, so that makes: * before 31 Dec 2016: 0%\n* between 1 Jan 2017 and 30 Jun 2017: 2% + 0.95*10% ~ 11%\n* not before 1 July 2017: 89%.

Even if the EU wants to speed it up there does not seem to be any way that the EU can do so except by agreeing a deal with the UK. A standoff is quite possible, where the EU refuses to agree a deal and so the UK refuses to invoke article 50.\nI suspect that the longer it takes to invoke article 50 the less appetite for Brexit there will be in the UK, as the effects of the prospect of Brexit take effect (higher prices, lower private investment, bigger budget and balance of payment deficits). As the evidence is that negotiating trade deals with other countries (not the EU) will take several years, I don't see the UK giving up on getting deal a with the EU.  The likely timing of getting any agreement from the EU will to some extent depend on the European national election cycle. France has a general election in Apr/May 2017. The French government will not want to agree a deal with the UK that appears in any way to reward the UK for holding its referendum, as there are calls in France for a Frexit referendum. The UK is unlikely to agree a deal that punishes the UK. So this indicates that stalemate will continue until after May 2017. \nGermany has a general election some time between August and October 2017. Germany may be less determined to punish the UK, but their government will not want to appear weak just before their elections. So I see a small possibility of very quick deal being struck before November 2016, almost no chance between February and May 2017 with a higher probability after the German general election.  What could upset this calculation is an economic crash in the UK, but this could just as easily lead to abandoning Brexit as accepting any deal offered by the EU.  The new UK government structure appears have put the leading Brexit MPs in jobs where they are being challenged to deliver Brexit in the way that they promised (trade deals with the EU and lots of other countries) which most experts believed was very unlikely. This means that if the architects of Brexit fail to deliver the new UK government can reasonably claim that they tried their best and if they failed it was because the Brexit promise was a lie, not because the government ignored the outcome of the referendum.

The threat of Brexit is having consequences to the British economy - and even more important for this topic - the countries of Europe.  I expect the pressure to increase significantly to stop being coy, and get on with it.  France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are heading into tricky elections - this will push politicians to become even more political (whatever that means).  Europe is being hard about starting negoatiotions before Article 50, figuring that they want pressure to remain for GB to make up their minds and get on with it.  Finally, I see imigration pressure staying high in Europe, continuing to push isolationists in England to drive Brexit.
