President Trump met with his top economic advisers Thursday afternoon at the White House, where the president agreed to significant reductions on tariffs he has placed on $360 billion of Chinese goods in return for China\u2019s commitment to purchase American farm products and make other concessions, the people said. As part of the agreement, the president is expected to announce that he will delay or cancel tariffs on $160 billion of consumer products from China that are scheduled to go into effect on Sunday. Those additional tariffs would have resulted in the United States taxing nearly everything China ships into the United States and foregoing them would prevent another escalation in a trade fight that has inflicted economic damage on both sides of the Pacific (Para. 1-3).\n*\nReference\n* Swanson, A., Rappeport A. & Bradsher, K.

From this lens, his latest comments are not indicative of an unbridgeable divide but instead can be viewed as part of Trump's messaging campaign to the American public. He benefits from appearing to be strong arming the Chinese.\n- For China, poor economic data is showcasing they are struggling from the trade war and while the leadership is probably willing to wait out until after the 2020 election before engaging with the US on a major deal, it could very well be willing to take a step toward a deal in with a phase 1 agreement to improve/stabilize business sentiment in the short term.\n- Timing is short, reducing the likelihood Overall, considering these factors I find it difficult to go very low (consensus currently at 10%).
