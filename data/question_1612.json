I think I understand the reason better now why this question was \"too difficult to forecast\" from the beginning.\nFrom the question it is clear that the first day counting would be 07 June 2020. On this day, there were only 7,169 tests taken, which is ridiculously little for a state like Texas, and is only 27.2% of the average daily tests taken during 08 June to13 June 2020 (average: 26,312). Testing on 07 June 2020 is also 36,064 or 83,4% below the peak testing during this episode of 43,233 tests on 11 June 2020. I consider this one number of tests on 07 June 2020 a near-total breakdown. If I had know this when I first forecasted this on 11 May 2020, I had certainly not answered this question.\nThe effect to it is simple: we were asked to predict a 7-day average, where only 6 serious values are being taken. When one value is missing more or less, you are in effect asked to predict the 85%-value of a 7-day average. The low testing figure 07 June 2020 (7,169) then obviously fed into the results of the next day (638 confirmed cases 08 June 2020). Therefore, the total span width (2,504 (as of 10 June) minus 638 (as of 08 June) = 1,866 (74,5% of the peak value)) was larger than the highest bucket threshold in the question. If we leave the dismal figures in question (7,169 tests as of 07 June 2020, 638 cases as of 08 June 2020) out of consideration, the question resolution is pretty much crystal clear:\n1,970 cases on average for the six days 07 June plus 09 June through 13 June 2020, means highest bucket.\n26,312 tests on average for the six days 08 June through 13 June 2020.\n7.49% average positivity rate.

As there is no number of tests available as of now, I take an arbitrary assumption of 32,000 test instead to feed my projection. In case there is another day count of 2,500 to 2,600 tomorrow, the steep upward trend would be confirmed and the daily cases 13 June around 2,000 would be sufficient for the last bucket, however one would still not be out of the woods completely. I lean on @chiefthe 's observation that Mondays are the lowest days of the week and on we'll have no completely outlandish results left. All depends now on how frightened the TX Health Department became from yesterday's figure 2,504, and how fast and seriously they increase testing. Today's actual No. of tests will determine which way they go and if there is a new trend in testing capacity which may result in yet more higher case counts.

After reconciliation of daily test attribution, there's a more consistent picture: 19,233 of the tests as of 09 June 2020 have been re-attributed to 08 June. The most striking point: Daily positivity rate hit 18.2% as of 10 June 2020 (2,504 positives out of 13,732 new tests), as tests/testing kits have obviously been very scarce in TX lately and too many infections have remained undetected for too long; this opens up likely paths for possible new gloomy scenarios on the high end. Each of today's confirmed case will have worked, traveled and gathered for two to three days and set free a tiny avalanche of new infections in a chain reaction. \nTherefore, re-re-adjusting to 100%.

It is still unclear to which degree UV rays, humidity and temperature or climate more generally influence the lifetime/half-life of the virus. This is a factor that I have not considered so far.

The plateau oscillates quite a bit, which I think is a combination of 1) day to day randomness in testing and infections, and  2) the fact that each large outbreak is an ensemble of smaller city- and town-level outbreaks, each of which probably look more like your classic logistic/epidemic curve. A month out is hard to know, but I think it's very unlikely that cases will have crashed down by then, especially with some uptick in growth with coming unlocks, and the lack of a ROK-style eradication capability. I think that it's mostly likely it will be oscillating around the current value (just below 1300), with enough variance to put it in either band.
