Many have already raised an MOU signed July 2019 between the Russian Federation and Iranian Navies - which seems to suggest at least the plausibility of joint Russian-Iranian naval exercises. Given the nature of the Iranian fleet as a littoral defense force and Russia's increased demonstrations of their 'blue water' capabilities, it seems very likely Russian naval presence in the region will grow (a number of Russian warships have transversed the Suez canal in the past three years for stated anti-piracy reasons among other things)  A few other factors worth considering:\n- would a joint Iranian-Russian exercise risk antagonizing the U.S. following its partial withdrawal from Syria?\n- Status of Russo-Turkish relations vis-a-vis Iran?\n- potential for Saudi or Gulf escalation following previous attacks  Bottom line: Russian-Iranian joint naval exercises are likely on the horizon (22% in the next 9 months) but very unlikely during the next 30-odd days.

General Ghadir Nezami Pour, chief of international affairs and defense diplomacy for the Iranian military's general staff, told the country's Mosalas magazine Saturday that Iran has \"begun joint exercises with other countries, and for the first time since the Islamic Revolution, we will hold joint naval exercises with Russia and China as the two major powers in the northern Indian Ocean and the Oman Sea.\" . . .\n. . . \n. . .  Moscow and Tehran . . . [signed] a memorandum of understanding to deepen their naval ties in July. At that ceremony, Iranian naval commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi first revealed plans for joint Iran-Russia navy drills in the northern Indian Ocean. Earlier this month, Zarif confirmed the reports, adding that \"maybe other countries will also be interested in joining these drills,\" as quoted by the state-run Tass Russian News Agency. Moscow has not confirmed its participation in such maneuvers, but already worked alongside Tehran in Syria. . . . \n. . . \nAsked Monday about Beijing's potential involvement in upcoming exercises with Tehran and Moscow, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang offered a vague response, telling a news briefing only that \"the Chinese armed forces maintain normal exchange and cooperation with armed forces of other countries.\" He referred reporters to the Chinese military, which has yet to release any information regarding the exercises. Jacopo Scita, an H.H. Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah doctoral fellow at Durham University's School of Government and International Affairs, pointed out \"that the news of the possible joint navy drill came from Iranian sources and has not been reported or confirmed by Chinese and Russian state media,\" though he did note that \"an Iranian high-profile military delegation visited China in the past weeks, where they were invited to visit a marine base and navy facilities in Shanghai.\" \"It is quite obvious that Chinese and Iranian officials discussed military cooperation, technologies, and even future joint drills. However, I believe it is unlikely that such a drill will happen soon, especially given the very sensitive moment in the Persian Gulf,\" Scita told Newsweek. \"China has always been very careful to balance its position between Iran and Saudi Arabia and, in the aftermath of the Aramco attack, a major naval exercise with Iran and Russia in the Sea of Oman will send a message not attuned to Beijing's usual posture.\" \"The impression is that Iran is really trying to picture its relationships with Russia and China stronger than what they actually are,\" he explained, calling it part of \"an Iranian attempt to put pressure on both the U.S., dismissing the idea that 'maximum pressure' is isolating Iran, and on Russia and China too, in the attempt of pushing the two countries to support Iran more openly and actively.\" Farhad Rezaei, an Iran-focused defense and security analyst based in Ottawa, told Newsweek that \"Iran probably wants to send multiple messages.\" \"First, to show that its has the support of China and Russia if attacked by the United States, especially since this announcement comes at a time when Washington declared it would send more forces and missile defense capabilities to Saudi Arabia (following the strikes on the Aramco oil facilities, which was attributed to Iran),\" he explained. \"Second, Iran also tries to reassert its presence in the waters with help of the Chinese and Russians especially since the announcement of the drill coincides with Washington's declaration that it is forming a naval mission with the other regional countries including Saudi Arabia and UAE.\" Like Scita, however, he noted that \"there are a number of issues that should be taken into consideration\" when it came to speculation about a growing axis among Iran, Russia and China.\n. . . \n\"First, China and Russia are also partners of Saudi Arabia and Israel as well, and they are not happy with Iran's harassing of the kingdom and its verbal attack on Israel,\" Rezaei told Newsweek. \"Second, the Chinese are not happy with Iran's actions in the waters and its alleged attack on Aramco, because that will cause a remarkable increase in the oil price.\"\n~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I note that they mention the Gulf of Oman, not the Strait of Hormuz, and that doubts are being expressed about how soon the naval exercise will occur.\n"], [3997, "2019-09-29T18:29:53Z", [0.04], ""], [37250, "2019-09-29T16:56:42Z", [0.0], ""], [10612, "2019-09-29T14:22:13Z", [0.0], ""], [75611, "2019-09-28T16:48:28Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2019-09-28T11:07:05Z", [0.01], ""], [39505, "2019-09-28T10:14:19Z", [0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-28T10:00:42Z", [0.03], ""], [14107, "2019-09-28T10:00:08Z", [0.05], ""], [75291, "2019-09-28T07:37:34Z", [0.12], "Iran and Russia have had naval exercises in the past in the Caspian Sea.

Sanger and Fassihi (2019) Sept. 23, stated that: When Iran\u2019s president and foreign minister arrived in New York a year ago for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, they were riding high. At news conferences and in television appearances, they cast President Trump as an untrustworthy deal-breaker, and European leaders largely sided with the pair in a desperate effort to preserve the 2015 nuclear agreement after the United States renounced it.\nThis year could not be more different. Suddenly, President Hassan Rouhani and his witty, often biting American-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, are on the defensive. They are denying any Iranian involvement in the destruction of two major Saudi oil facilities, an assertion that even former Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the nuclear accord four years ago and has become its biggest defender, finds far-fetched. Iran, he said, was behind the attack \u201cone way or the other\u201d (Para. 1-3). But \u201cIran has come to this year\u2019s U.N.G.A. with a real wake-up call that what they are able to get from Europeans is no more than some limited political cover for support of the nuclear deal,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of Middle East and North Africa studies for the European Council on Foreign Relations (Para 7). Iranian officials, she said, have arrived in New York discovering that the Europeans cannot offer any substantive economic relief, and that even a French-led initiative to issue a credit line of $15 billion, essentially an advance payment on Iranian oil shipments, is likely to fail. Washington will most likely not issue waivers, and European banks are unwilling to join the effort if they believe they will be banned from clearing transactions in American dollars. Two weeks ago, it appeared that Iran might find a way out, taking Mr. Trump up on his offer of negotiations. But the attacks on Saudi Arabia, and the American accusations of Iranian involvement, have all but killed that possibility, American officials said (Para. 7-9). The hawkish Mr. Pompeo clearly senses that the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities, for which he blamed the Iranians before any forensic evidence had been gathered, have fundamentally changed the negotiating dynamics. He finally has the opportunity he has sought for 18 months: a chance to kill Europe\u2019s effort to neutralize sanctions (Para. 17). Mr. Pompeo doubled down on his critique on Sunday, saying the Iranians are \u201cbloodthirsty and looking for war,\u201d and suggesting that as the sanctions cut deeper, the Iranian people will demand changes in their government \u2014 though he stopped just short of demanding regime change. \u201cThey\u2019re operating today in five countries,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said of the Iranians on Sunday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s expensive. They\u2019ve already had to make difficult decisions about whether they\u2019re going to feed their people, provide medicine to their people, or they\u2019re going to launch missiles into Saudi Arabia\u201d (Para. 17-19).

The withdrawal from Syria and his position relating to the events after the houthi attack on the Saudi refining facilities suggests this is a main trait of the Trump administration.\n\nRussia-Middle East\n\u2022\t Apart from some logistical and ground support, Russia is not interacting with the middle eastern front remotely as much as the media would have most people believe. For example, the S300 system sold to Syria is yet to be delivered, despite dire need of said system by their syrian \"allies\". This is probably to avoid interfering with Israeli interests. Russia has no interest in creating a conflict with Saudi Arabia -quite the contrary, as they would make an excelent weapons client for the russian military complex, and an convenient ally in future oil disruptions.\nRussia-Saudi Arabia\n\uf0a7\tDuring 2017, Saudi Arabia encouraged the United States to remove sanctions on Russia pertaining to its activity in Ukraine in exchange for Russian assistance in ending the Iranian military presence in Syria.[48]\n\uf0a7\tRussia has remained neutral between Saudi Arabia and Qatar in the 2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis, offering to mediate in July 2017.[49]\n\uf0a7\tIn December 2017, Russia withdrew diplomatic representation from the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sana'a, in opposition to the killing of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh by the Houthis. The killing took place as a consequence of his defection from the Houthi-dominated Supreme Political Council to the Saudi coalition in the Yemeni Civil War.[50]\n\uf0a7\tFrom December 2017 onward, Saudi Arabia abandoned its past support for UN resolutions condemning the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, instead choosing to abstain.[51][52]\nIn August 2018, Russia backed Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Canada, with Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stating that \"the politicization of human rights matters is unacceptable\".[53]\n\uf0a7\tIn the aftermath of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018, Putin stated that Russia \"cannot start deteriorating relations\" with Saudi Arabia as \"it did not know what really happened.\"[54] His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later added that there was \"no reason basically not to believe\" the official statements issued by Saudi Arabia on the matter.[55]\nIn December 2018, Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Bogdanov warned the United States against interference in the line of succession to the Saudi throne by pushing for the ouster of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, following reports that U.S. officials would support replacing him with Ahmed bin Abdulaziz.[56] Bogdanov stated that \"the King made a decision and I can\u2019t even imagine on what grounds someone in America will interfere in such an issue and think about who should rule Saudi Arabia, now or in the future.\"[57]\n\nFrom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_relations#Saudi_King's_visit_to_Russia_(October_2017)&gt; \n\n\n\nForecast:\nNo action.

Naval exercises can happen really fast after announcement or might happen really late. There were announcements of joint exercises in the Caspian sea around January, which did not materialize yet and which are in principle unrelated to the Strait of Hormuz, but which might give a clue with regards to the expected delay. For the strait of Hormuz in June it was hope to happen in the following months or before the end of the Persian new year (March 20, 2020), not clear which one of the two. Now apparently the Russian navy will arrive for the end of the year. According to one source in some of the multiple news I was checking, Iran likes to hold naval exercises in autumn, but in 2019 they happen in February, in 2018 in August and in 2017 in March, but in 2016 maybe late summer / early autumn (have to check on this). This makes it difficult to find an anchor. From 2015-2017 there were several exercises with the Russians in the Caspian and in 2017 another one with the Chinese. There are a bit more than two months for the ending date of the question. If I assume a delay of 6 months, with a variance of 4 months, and make it into a log-normal distribution, this gives me a 16% probability. If I assume that they plan to do it before the Iranian new year with more or less the same probability for each month, this gives me a 33% probability. Together, this gives a 25%, but I don't trust the assumption of equal probability in time for the second case: I will weight the log-normal estimation with 2/3 and the uniform estimation with 1/3, giving a 22%.

With tensions being as they are, I find it unlikely that Iran would choose to further provoke the US and its allies. Russia and Iran may conduct joint naval exercises in other parts of the Indian Ocean, but as of now it is unlikely they would do so in the Strait of Hormuz, baring provocation from the US or the Saudis.

The Iranian and Chinese navies held an exercise in 2017 in the Strait and in 2014, and the Iranians have held yearly exercise under the name \"noble/great prophet\". (open to being wrong about this in case I have missed any). The Russians could potentially join in these exercises, but they are held in December typically. The Russian Navy is holding a naval exercise with the Indian Navy in December, using ships from the Pacific Fleet (https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/india-russia-military-exercise-indra-2019-to-take-place-in-december/) This could be what the Iranians mean when they say that the drills will take place this year. As @rjfmgy has pointed out, this announcement has been one sided, and we have not heard confirmation from the Russians that these exercises are taking place or that they will be taking place in the Strait. The Iranians have previously announced naval exercises that then didn't go ahead exactly as announced - the 2014 plan to deploy naval assets near the continental US maritime border. I then looked at the feasibility of getting Russian ships to an Iranian port. Back of the packet calculations, if departing from the Russian naval installation in Syria to Iran, its about 3200 nautical miles if travelling through the Seuz canal at 14 knots, and would take 9 days (https://sea-distances.org/). The newest Russian corvettes dont have the range for this, but the newest Russian frigate, the Admiral Gorshkov-class do have the range (and there could well be resupply ships travelling with them, and they could *potentially* refuel in the Chinese base in Djibouti, so I will take it that they can technically undertake the trip.) I haven't checked which ships would be available as I dont speak Russian or Iranian and the ship deployments are less public than those of the US or Royal Navy which are announced on twitter.
