We don't know ... 1. ... what exact questions are asked.\n2. ... how these questions are translated into scales.\n3. ... how questions are ultimately weighted. That means, there is a lot of uncertainty on what the index is ought to measure and how the index is constructed. From the 2019 Customer Happiness Index we know that 16 different categories are used that each refer to a specific government service [1]. Construction of the index takes place \"through integrated methodological studies [... ] tailored to suit the UAE experience and directives in providing government services\" [1] - possibly referring to a type of \"integrated modification methodology\" [2]. It doesn't change the fact, however, that we don't have enough information to make a good judgment.  What does that leave us with? First of all, it seems the most fruitful to think about those services with the highest potential for improvement ... but I don't know enough about the different agencies and the lack of information on those areas that have performed the best and the worst makes it hard to get a grasp where potential improvements might happen. That said, there only remains the option to rely on the announcements of those in power. Do we trust that them setting ambitious goals is enough to actually see improvements? Do the announcements of the Dubai Crown Prince mean they are confident in reaching a better outcome - possibly through the provision of resources and competent and sufficient personnel [3]? Does his personal oversight [4] mean actual improvements have to happen - or at least be evaluated to be there? And what does the outbreak of COVID-19 mean for the outcome - less resources, less improvements? Currently, I'm confident that they'll pull it off and we'll see a higher value.
