This follows the cancellation of the first four races in the F1 circuit and currently, the lock-down is in effect indefinitely [2].  In order to build the Monaco Grand Prix track, it takes 7 weeks (this year is scheduled to be a historic Grand Prix race [3]), 250 paid workers, and 2,000 volunteers are working public spaces and moving equipment between Italy, France, and Monaco [4]. The current indefinite lockdown in Italy, which was just extended past 3 April [5] and the current 15-day lockdown in France [6] will make it difficult to move equipment to Monaco. Thus, both the equipment and manpower will be near impossible to utilize. Additionally, there is speculation that F1 is targeting the 1 June race in Azerbaijan as it's the first race of the season, and are in discussions with Monaco authorities on when the Monaco Grand prix can take place [7]. Another indication that the Monaco Grand Prix will be suspended or canceled is the unanimous vote by F1 teams to move the season's annual shut-down from August to the March-April timeframe and a vote is expected to be taken today to ratify the cancellation of this race [8]. I assess with a 100% probability that the Monaco Grand Prix will be canceled or Postponed before 22 May 2020.
