Feb 25: \"Oscar flashback: How close were 'Birdman' & 'Boyhood,' '12 Years a Slave' & 'Gravity,' 'The Hurt Locker' & 'Avatar'?\" --> http://www.goldderby.com/news/11852/oscar-predictions-best-picture-the-revenant-the-big-short-spotlight-analysis-13579086.html In a previous article, I established an expansive theory which revolved around mathematics and statistics. Now that everything has been revealed, we have our final numbers. \u201cSpotlight\u201d has 21 boxes ticked off, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d has 22 and \u201cThe Revenant\u201d has the most, with 23. Yes, I predicted that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d would get the most boxes ticked off and yes, because of that I predicted that it would win Best Picture at the Oscars. BUT, although that prediction was wrong, my theory of \u2018whichever film ticks of the most boxes will win Best Picture\u2019 is still on course to be proven right... as long as \u201cThe Revenant\u201d wins big at the Oscars. But that does not mean \u201cThe Big Short\u201d or \u201cSpotlight\u201d comes away as a loser yet, as this season has given us the most intense rivalry with the closest battle to be crowned top dog since I can remember. Therefore, I\u2019ve decided to take three great rivalries and examine them under my \u201935 boxes\u2019 research and theory, hopefully learning something about this year\u2019s race in return.  2014: \u201cBirdman\u201d vs \u201cBoyhood\u201d\n2013: \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d vs \u201cGravity\u201d\n2009: \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d vs \u201cAvatar\u201d So, what does all of this mean? Firstly, I believe it may mean that \u201cBirdman,\u201d was lucky to win. \u201cBoyhood\u201d ticks six more boxes then \u201cBirdman.\" Even if we take away those Golden Globes boxes, as some people like to do, then \u201cBoyhood\u201d is still five ahead. We could say that certain boxes mean more then others (PGA WIN over Golden Globe Acting Nomination for example) but the reason I created this style of research and this article with these 35 boxes is to be as expansive as possible across the board, not to designate importance. It\u2019s a statistical, mathematical way of looking at the Oscar race, devoid of all the usual \u2018this tea leaf means more\u2019 stuff that we Escapologists (that\u2019s a word, right?) love to dwell in. And here, in what is the exception to my theory and the rule of \u2018the most boxes ticked wins,\u2019 I believe that it shows \u201cBirdman\u201d\u2019s Best Picture victory to be an upset. I won\u2019t go so far as to say it was a mistake (\u201cBirdman,\u201d is a great film, after all), but those numbers would suggest that. \u201cBoyhood\u201d was number one from the very beginning of the season (practically since Sundance that year) and my gut instinct is that it peaked too early and people perhaps became bored of it, fed up of hearing about it and enjoyed the fresh, late arrival of \u201cBirdman\u201d and so wanted to enjoy this \u2018new toy\u2019 on the scene. And that late surge hushed \u201cBoyhood\u201d and was enough for \u201cBirdman\u201d to sneak the win. A very close race, but \u201cBirdman\u201d\u2019s late, \u2018new toy\u2019 quality gave it that edge. \u201c12 Years A Slave,\u201d however, performs much better over it\u2019s rival, \u201cGravity,\u201d as it pulled ahead by five boxes. Although \u201cGravity\u201d did have a lot of support, prevailing at the DGA and PGA, \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d had that oh-so-important universal love (crucial to winning Best Picture because of the preferential ballot), doing well across the board. So, it wasn\u2019t a barnstormer by Steve McQueen\u2019s drama, but \u201c12 Years A Slave,\u201d with all that concrete support in all the key areas (directing, acting, writing, editing) and at all the right places, gave it a fairly easy ride in the end. \u201cGravity\u201d gave it a good go, though. In the third rivalry there really is a rout, with \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d ticking off a whopping 13 more boxes then \u201cAvatar.\u201d Although \u201cAvatar\u201d was said to be a fierce competitor to Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s war drama at the time, on closer inspection it is blown out of the water and blown out of Pandora along with all that Unobtanium (wow, what a clever, imaginative name for something that is hard to obtain!.) Indeed, \u201cAvatar\u201d\u2019s lack of acting and writing prowess across nearly all of the categories exposes that crucial weakness. \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d had both across all 35 boxes, along with the guild support and a lot of love for director Bigelow. So, on closer inspection, this race was not as close as we once thought. Now, this is all very well and good, but what does it mean for this year\u2019s Oscar race?\nBecause this year is a three-horse race as opposed to the above years\u2019 two-horse races, it is a little tougher to draw comparisons from. However (as previously mentioned), after the BAFTAS, which were the final few boxes of the 35 to be revealed, \u201cSpotlight\u201d\u2019s final total comes in at 21, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d\u2019s at 22 and \u201cThe Revenant\u201d at 23. All of these films have been on the same page pretty much right from the off, garnering equal, consistent support across the board - so there won\u2019t be a \u201cBirdman/Boyhood\u201d situation this year. Nor will we have an \u201cAvatar/The Hurt Locker\u201d situation; none of the three films have managed to pull ahead the way \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d did. So, the rivalry from which we can learn the most is \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d versus \u201cGravity.\u201d Even though this year\u2019s race is a much closer one then McQueen\u2019s period drama vs Cuaron\u2019s space thriller, both those films had splits and both had their strengths and weaknesses just like this year's trio. So, in relation to the above research, let\u2019s take a look at how this year\u2019s films fit into the mould of the \u201c12 Years A Slave/Gravity\u201d rivalry and see who is the likely runner(s) up and winner. It\u2019s worth mentioning that due to the close nature of our race this year, the words \u2018winner\u2019 and \u2018runner up\u2019 have often become muddled for all three films. \u201cThe Big Short\u201d\nLike \u201cGravity,\u201d Adam McKay\u2019s \u2018traumedy,\u2019 as he calls it, prevailed at PGA. However like Cuaron\u2019s space-flick, it failed to win Best Picture at the Golden Globes, the Critic\u2019s Choice awards and the BAFTAS. Both films won zilch at SAG, too.\nBut comparisons can also be made with \u201c12 Years A Slave.\u201d Both films got consistent support across the board for the key four elements; directing, acting, writing and editing - plus the corresponding nominations at the Oscars. So \u201cThe Big Short\u201d is stuck somewhere in between these two films, which is proven by it\u2019s numbers; it got 22 total boxes ticked off, while \u201cGravity\u201d got 20 and \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d got 25. Almost slap bang in the middle of the two. It\u2019s better then a runner up but, I\u2019m afraid, it\u2019s not quite good enough to be a winner. With just a tad more support, I could be saying roll on the Academy Awards for the \u201cAnchorman\u201d anchor and his traumedy masterpiece. \u201cSpotlight\u201d\nTom McCarthy\u2019s restrained, journalist-drama has fallen behind. Although it won at Critic\u2019s Choice, as \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d did, it came away from the Golden Globes empty-handed and struggled at the BAFTAS, unlike \u201c12 Years A Slave.\u201d\nFurthermore, \u201cSpotlight\u201d has failed to earn any consistent acting and directing support, both of which \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d had in abundance. It has also fared poorly with the guilds, with it\u2019s only triumph coming at SAG for Best Ensemble. Of all the guilds, that award is probably the least accurate tea leaf; only six of the last 10 Best Ensemble winners have gone on to win Best Picture. Heck, \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d won Best Ensemble in 2013 and later got blanked at the Academy Awards. Indeed, \u201cSpotlight,\u201d with only it\u2019s screenplay providing it with any consolation, is falling into the mould of \u201cGravity\u201d and into the mould of runner up, if that. \u201cThe Revenant\u201d\nInarritu\u2019s western also draws similarities between both films. It\u2019s got three out of the four key Oscar nominations in directing, acting and editing, the exact same as \u201cGravity,\u201d and both films won at DGA. Similarly to \u201c12 Years A Slave,\u201d it won at SAG, won the top prize at the Golden Globes and BAFTA (both films also got a Best Actor win at the latter as well) and got consistent support across the entire board. It does have one weakness, though... it\u2019s writing. As mentioned time and again, screenwriters Inarritu and Mark L. Smith have failed to crop up anywhere on the circuit. But the key thing here is that \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d like \u201c12 Years A Slave,\u201d has the most boxes ticked out of the 35. The former has 23, while the latter has 25. That final stat is the one that sticks with me. Like Daniel Montgomery, I too like to stick to stats and math when it comes to predicting and try my best to avoid emotion-predicting. I have gone on record stating that I have faith in my theory and, like my theory states, \u2018the film with the most boxes ticked will win Best Picture.\u2019 All of the 35 boxes have now been revealed. Time is up and I\u2019m staying faithful to my theory and faithful to math.  ~~~~~~~ COMMENT: Man, I wish I hadn't thrown so much shade at REV at the beginning of this IFP (it's partly why I've got it so high right now).

God it is hard to predict the winning picture in such an unusual year...  So the race is clearly between 3 movies, and here is my updated rationale for each one of them. Revenant: Revenant has gained a lot of momentum since its win at BAFTAs, that's why I'm increasing its probability to 30%. Not to mention it is the one with more nominations (12). Historically, when a picture has 12 or more nominations, it wins the award. However, only 3 movies have won the Oscar without a screenplay nomination in the last 75 years (Titanic, The sound of music, Hamlet). Moreover, I believe that the British Academy somewhat made it up to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for not giving the award last year (lost to Boyhood and Linklater), and the other two serious contenders were clearly American subjects which are not as attractive to the British critics as Nature vs Man. In addition, Revenant won the DGA award, which predicts the winning director about 90% of the times and the 80% of the times for the film. Personally, it was my favorite movie, I really hope it wins, but statistics are something that I just can't ignore. Spotlight: Spotlight was snubbed at Editing and Directing at BAFTAs and American Cinema Editors Awards (ACE), two major categories it would need to win in order to take the best picture award home. Actors loved the film, and also did journalists, but not all of them will vote for the Academy Awards. Spotlight won the SAG, but, sadly for them, this is the lowest success rate predictor of all Guild awards. So I believe Revenant managed to catch up with Spotlight, and its chances for winning the Oscar are now better than ever. The Big Short: So, out of these films, this one I liked the least (not that I didn't enjoy it). However, as I mentioned earlier, hard data is something I find really difficult to ignore. Big Short won the PGA, and as I contemplated in all my previous forecasts, it has aligned (100%) with the Academy award ever since they have the same 'preferential ballot' voting system. Both systems have around 7,000 voters, which should add statistical significance to the PGA. In addition, it is the only film to hit the big four nominations beside Spotlight (Directing, Actor, Editing, Screenplay), and the only best picture nominee other than Spotlight to have a SAG cast nomination. It is the ONLY nominee to hit all five major guild nominations and all five BAFTA nominations. Not only that, but it won a three of the most critical guild awards: Producers, Writers and Editors.  I probably have a poor taste in cinema, however, I'm sticking to the numbers here. Personally, I'd rather have Revenant taking the Oscar, but I think it is best if I stick to the numbers and have a pleasant surprise if it goes the other way.

I'm still staying heavily on REV to make up for being 0 on it for so long throughout the lifespan of this IFP. I think in the day or two before the Oscars, I might weigh in with a \"final\" prediction. Feb 19: \"'The Revenant' is ahead by a nose\" --> https://www.intelligentlifemagazine.com/culture/the-daily/the-revenant-is-ahead-by-a-nose The race for the Best Picture Oscar is all over the place this year. Pundits always say that, having a professional interest in making the race sound closer than it is. But this year it really is close, with all the preceding awards which normally foretell Oscar glory going in completely different directions. Tom McCarthy\u2019s sexual-abuse expos\u00e9 \u201cSpotlight\u201d was the front-runner for a long time, picking up the acting-ensemble award from the Screen Acting Guild \u2013 until its momentum was stolen by Adam McKay\u2019s \u201cThe Big Short\u201d. This film about the Wall Street meltdown won Best Drama at the Producers Guild of America (PGA), and who would bet against them? Except the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, which earlier this week gave the Best Film, Director, Cinematography and Actor awards to Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s brutal, beautiful Western, \u201cThe Revenant\u201d.  I\u00f1\u00e1rritu picked up an Oscar for \u201cBirdman\u201d last year and he could well be about to win again, making him the first director since John Ford to accomplish back-to-back wins. Never underestimate the Academy\u2019s desire to make history. Nobody likes a sweep more than them. There are few things more satisfying \u2013 or simpler \u2013 than going down that list of boxes, checking the same film for Editing, Best Picture, Directing, Screenplay. It looks crisp, decisive, unassailable. It\u2019s a rare Best Picture winner that doesn\u2019t also win for Editing, regardless of whether it happens to be the best-edited film or not (was \u201cArgo\u201d?). No film has won Best Picture without also winning for its script since \u201cTitanic\u201d; and auteurists get hot and bothered when films win without their directors, like riderless horses.   That has been the trend in recent years. The reasons are complex, having to do with Hollywood\u2019s shifting economic model, but they boil down to basic maths. While the number of Oscars to hand out remains constant (24), the number of potential films to chose from \u2013 which is to say, dramas with gravitas that score highly with critics and audiences \u2013 shrinks slightly every year, as Hollywood chases \u201cStar Wars III\u201d and \u201cSpiderman 4\u201d. Which means the Academy has had to hunt slightly further afield than they would normally like, whether that means going indie (\u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d), going genre (\u201cThe Departed\u201d, \u201cNo Country for Old Men\u201d), heading overseas (\u201cThe Artist\u201d), or softening objections to arthouse neobrutalism in the name of a good cause (\u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d).  None of those winners is what you might call a typical \u201cOscar movie\u201d. It\u2019s not because the Academy has gotten hipper. This year\u2019s controversy over the whiteness of the Oscars, which resulted in a promise by the Academy\u2019s president to rejuvenate membership, only told us what we already know: that the preponderance of the Academy\u2019s 6,000 members are white, male and over 60. If someone were to make \u201cGandhi\u201d today they would be all over it in a second. Hence the forces of fogeyishnes that propelled \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cArgo\u201d to their wins. The preferential ballot favours consensus choices over polarisers: it\u2019s not enough to be the number-one pick of a group of passionate supporters, you must also collect enough number-two and number-three picks on everybody else\u2019s ballot.  The brutality of \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is the sticking point here. Traditionally viscera cuts against gravitas, although again, Best Picture winners like \u201cThe Departed\u201d and \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d have loosened the Academy up a little. They owed Scorsese \u201cThe Departed\u201d, and \u201c12 Years A Slave\u201d had the historical weight of its subject matter. Is the fact that \u201cThe Revenant\u201d is a Western, like \u201cNo Country\u201d, sufficiently reassuring? If not then the field is open for either \u201cThe Big Short\u201d or \u201cSpotlight\u201d, our original front-runner. \u201cThe Big Short\u201d won big at the PGAs, which has predicted the eventual Best Picture winner all eight times that it has voted since adopting the same preferential ballot as the Oscars. It\u2019s not hard to see why this film, about a band of unlikely renegades betting against the money markets, was popular with producers: that\u2019s a pretty good description of their job. But the film\u2019s blackly satirical, snarky tone slightly thwarts the gravitas requirements. The Academy wants its moral lessons served up in neater, squarer boxes.  Which is where \u201cSpotlight\u201d comes in. For some critics, myself included, Tom McCarthy\u2019s film is scrupulous but a little underdeveloped dramatically: we never felt the Church\u2019s wrath. The sleeping giant never awoke.  But there\u2019s no denying the power of its victims\u2019 testimonials. Of all the contenders, \u201cSpotlight\u201d has the warmest emotional current. The only problem is that it looks set to win only one other Oscar, for Best Original Screenplay, which would make it the lowest-yield Best Picture winner in history. Is Hollywood ready for this, the anti-sweep? At this stage, I have \u201cThe Revenant\u201d ahead by a nose, but check back on the 25th for my final predictions in all 24 categories.

Over the last 20 years (The timescale I've been using for the other award-based indicators), the BAFTA best picture has gone on to win the Oscar 9 times. This isn't a great indicator, but it's much better than the 20% we'd expect if they were unrelated. I'm eyeballing that this is statistically significant, so we'll go with it.  I'm also going to weight the BAFTA a little bit higher, because 4 of the 11 movies that won the BAFTA best picture but failed to win the Oscar were British (Four Weddings and a Funeral, the Full Monty, The Queen, Atonement), and I'm guessing that the BAFTA's are *slightly* biased towards British entries. Thus, since The Revenant is not British, I think the BAFTAs are slightly better indicator of its Oscars success than if it were. So I'll say that the BAFTAs have 50% accuracy, which is pretty significant. For no good reason I'll say that the combined accuracy of BAFTA and DGA is 90%. This gives me 35% on Revenant, 28% on Spotlight, and 32% on The Big Short. I'll bump down Revenant 4% because  I\u00f1\u00e1rritu won last year, and then I'll bump it up like 6% because it's been nominated for shitloads of other categories, finally giving the probabilities I've assigned. DISCLAIMER: This is actually a really lazy and inconsistent way of assigning probabilities, FYI. It beats running on intuitions about how much you think Academy voters like finance films, but it's not great. It'd be awesome if anyone could refine this for me.

However, as @gleald points out, since the PGA changed its voting method to that of the Oscars, it has had 100% accuracy - so I'll weight the past 7 years more highly and put its accuracy at 85%. - Spotlight won the Critic's Choice Movie Awards, which predicts about 60% of the time, and the SAG outstanding cast award, which predicts 50% of the time. We'll put this as a combined indicator with 70% accuracy. - The Revenant won the DGA, which predicts 81% of the time. - I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film Birdman won best picture last year, and I'm told that it's unlikely that he will win it twice in a row. We'll reduce the above 81% to 70% for this reason. - Over the last 20 years, Braveheart was the only film to win Best Picture but failed to win the DGA, SAG, CCA, or the PGA, so we'll put the base rate at 5% for the films that aren't the top 3.

Some critics don\u2019t care how tough the production was, or how arduous the shooting schedule was and that you shouldn\u2019t get an Oscar via attrition. It could be argued that Leonardo did not have enough lines and extensive character dialogue to merit this award. Some of these factors could come into play while voting for the award. However, the odds are stacked in Leonardo's favor. He went to incredible heights to film this movie such as sleeping inside a dead animal, and coming close to getting life threatening frost bite. Not many actors would even attempt to do this, which is why this performance is so extraordinary. Other films such as the martian and spotlight could also get some votes and attention but the actors in these films do not go to the extremes in which Leonardo does in the Revenant. Leonardo also won best performance in the golden globes, giving more reason to believe that he will win. Some movie critics are already claiming that he is a lock to win the oscars, putting his chances of winning at about 70%.

I will add an element to consider, the studio behind each film.  On that account, the studios behind The Revenant have the advantage (they presumably have the resources and experience to mount the best Oscar campaign given the number of Oscar winning films they've produced).   I've been on the edge with The Revenant because it was not nominated on the script category and that is its weakest point.  I should add, its ending could very well compensate for any complexity the story may have lacked.

But I still think it's crowded at the top. There are good changes we can have another Crash year. \nAfter The Revenant win at the DGA, The Guardian called the race unpredictable (mainly because the top awards given in the industry went to different films).  Can the GJP prove them wrong?  \nA good indicator is the usual buzz at film festivals (Toronto, Sundance, Berlin) but I didn't attend this year. So, here is what I'm looking at:\n-SPOLIGHT won the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Critics Choice.  \n-THE BIG SHORT won the Producer's Guild (which some times has gone along with the Academy when the DGA has deviated).  \n-MAD MAX is still the critic's darling (included in many top 10 lists) but it wasn't nominated for best film at BAFTA which takes away points since, in recent years, they tend to go along with the Academy, at least in nominations.  \n-THE REVENANT'S weakest point is the script (one major category in which it didn't get a nom). \n-SPOTLIGHT has the best shot to get the award for best original script, and likewise, The BIG SHORT has the edge for best adapted screenplay.  \n-SPOTLIGHT, overall, is superbly crafted and carries a heavy moral weight.  The film's script should satisfy the Academy intellectually and emotionally. I don't want to get into criticism here but the film reaches very far in terms of society and something the Academy loves \"the human experience.\"  But is this topic in now or would the Hollywood elite have a more pressing issue in mind to push?  That matters. \n-MAD MAX has a female lead in a year where gender equality is one of the most talked about issues and that gives it points. This film got 10 noms overall, only second to REVENANT.  Production design of the film and a lot of technical aspects give it a lot of points as well.  \n- As for the BIG SHORT, there is a big demand for tv shows, docs and films about the financial crisis. It has one of the best scripts of the year and in many ways it's a difficult film to make well.   \n- The REVENANT is by all measures a directorial feat and has the most noms of all this year, 12, but I have doubts about its overall depth or its transcendence beyond the look at its main character.  I'm not sure we can tell all that much about humanity just by looking at Glass. Nature is the protagonist in the film and in many ways it can serve as a great metaphor. I still have doubts about the clarity of it's depth and frankly, unrelenting suffering can get a little tiring. Of them all, this ss the most difficult movie to make but a lot of people say they don't vote for a film based on that. \n-The DGA is traditionally the best predictor for the Academy Award (it's as old as the Oscars and I think it has only picked a different film 13 times) but in those years where it has picked a different film, the Producer's Guild has sided with the Oscar pick. \nIt is notable that the SAG is the largest branch of the Academy yet their record in predicting best picture is not great (this could be because they give award to actors individually and then to a film's cast ensemble). \nThe Golden Globes are not as good predictors as the DGA. \nWith that in mind, and pending the BAFTA on Feb 14, I am giving Spotlight the edge for best pic.  It only got 6 nom overall, just like Big Short, while the Revenant got 12 but I think that is because of the types of films that they are.  \n"], [15353, "2016-02-09T06:01:43Z", [0.26, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.45, 0.24], ""], [436, "2016-02-09T05:31:28Z", [0.18, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.27, 0.55], "I'm mostly here to knock Revenant down a peg.

This is hopeful for \"Spotlight\" this year, as it's an \"issue\" movie. \"The Departed\" is a gangster movie starring two Hollywood favorites -Leonardo di Caprio and Jack Nicholson- and directed by Martin Scorsese, another darling of the older Hollywood set. This is very similar to \"The Revenant\" this year, a Western directed by Alejandro Inarritu and starring di Caprio (who received the SAG award for Best Actor for both films). Notably, there was no \"issues\" film nominated the year \"The Departed\" won. I'm not sure what this means -except that either \"The Revenant\" or \"Spotlight\" could supplant \"The Big Short\". The producers branch of the Academy can't carry it alone. Does it mean that \"Spotlight\" is more likely to win than \"The Revenant\"? I think so, but the #2 choice of the Academy voters will determine the winner, if no film gets 50% of the vote on the first ballot. So the real question is which film is likely to get the most second place votes.

FYI, this is the voting procedure for Best Picture, from http://www.goldderby.com/cms/view/209/: \"Unlike the winners of the other categories which are determined by popular vote -- i.e, a voter picks just one of the nominees and the Oscar goes to the that nominee with the most votes -- the winner of Best Picture is arrived at by a more complicated system. The academy uses preferential voting, as it does to determine nominees in most other races, to determine the winner of Best Picture. This method of voting was reintroduced in 2009, when the academy went to 10 Best Picture nominees for the first time since 1943 and was kept it in place in 2010 when the number of nominees was to be somewhere between five and 10. The academy believes this \"best allows the collective judgment of all voting members to be most accurately represented.\" The preferential method was first used in 1934 when there were 12 Best Picture nominees (there had been between three and 10 in the first six years of the Academy Awards) and was used the following year when there were again 12 nominees, from 1936 to 1943 when there were 10 nominees, and in both 1944 and 1945 when there were just five contenders.  Voters rank the Best Picture nominees. If one nominee garners more than 50% of the first place votes, it will win Best Picture.  If, as is more likely, no nominee reaches this threshold, the film with the fewest first place votes is eliminated, with its ballots being reapportioned to the second place choice.  Should no film cross the required 50% + one ballot threshold, the film with the fewest first place votes is again elminated, with its ballots being apportioned to the next choice still in play (i.e., if the second place choice is no longer in the running, then the ballot would be reapportioned to the third place choice and so on.) This process of elimination and reapportion continues until one film reaches at least 50% + one ballots. That is the Best Picture winner.\""], [12828, "2016-02-07T17:11:21Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.03, 0.01, 0.03, 0.43, 0.35], ""], [18874, "2016-02-07T15:14:03Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0], "De Caprio is arguably \"over due\" after his many almost ran efforts.

There is a common element: all of major historical significance or periodicals except Birdman, Slumdog and No Country which are more contemporary societal pieces and all are somehow unique.\u00a0 All films are visually attractive yet are not particularly big-budget films. So, let me try\u2026 The obvious favorite is The Revenant, which like Last of the Mohicans, is an epic film. It has all elements to win and in a landslide. However, there are three reasons for no: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inarritu just won for Birdman and a two-in-a-row is highly unlikely as the Oscars are partially political and biased.

This is sometimes a draw back. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It could be argued that it is of little relevance, early trappers, and might not be differentiated enough from Last of the Mohicans to win. The second favorite is Spotlight. A moving drama of political and social relevance. Only issue, is that McCarty has made no movies of previous caliber. Third: The Big Short. Personally favorite and actually the only one I watched. It is crude and a bit cynical in its depiction and might not win as the producer has typically only makes weak comedies in the past. Also, walls street movies even with their messages are a bit glorifying easy-wealth. The Margin Call was notably better and came out empty handed. The Martian: Ridley Scott already has an Oscar and is does fit the typical winner categor, albeit futuristic Brooklyn: Could have a chance to support Nick Nornby, yet significance is on the low side Bridge of Spies: cannot comment, not a big fan of cold war spies movies, been done too often and are getting boring Room: seems very disturbing (will not watch) and does not fit at all with previous winners Mad Max: A visually attractive piece, yet basically a flat-out action film and a remake at that.

With the BAFTAs and Writers Guild awards in two weeks, the race is still up for grabs, but whichever film ends up winning the top prize at the Directors Guild awards this weekend will likely go into Oscar night the favorite. ~~~ COMMENT: I'm rejecting the premise that this is a three-picture race. I still think it's between SHORT and SPOT, as I think that one of those two will win the DGA this weekend.

The Martian has a lower probability because of its predictability (on a strict, broadly defined plot basis, it is not very complex, sort of unfolds before you) and also because it is in the same vein as Gravity; I think the Academy seems reluctant to give the award to a space thriller.  Top 3: A Close Race The Big Short - I've seen it twice and I think it's a hugely important film for our generation. The film oscillates effortlessly between jubilation, humor and sadness, loss as it delineates the housing crash in 2008. Short's star studded cast embodies its charisma, attention to detail, and at times outlandish nature. This has been my favorite movie of the year so far, but I think its lack of real conflict and story arc could hurt its chances. This seems to be one of the films that is nominated for everything but could fall short. It's also technically a comedy, which could also hurt its chances at winning. Spotlight - Seeing it tomorrow but I've heard great things. Many respectable reviewers (NYTimes, WSJ, Rolling Stone) have given it rave reviews, with WSJ's Morgenstern calling it \"the best film of the year.\" Spotlight seemingly has everything, a great cast, director, and compelling script that tells a story of truth and righteousness. Spotlight's thrilling nature will surely work in its favor.  The Revenant: Also saw this twice, the first time being front row at an advanced screening in December and the second in early January. I really love this film but I think it is at risk of being over-hyped. From its outset and even from the trailer viewers can determine that Leo will get his revenge. With this in mind it's obvious that this isn't necessarily what The Revenant is really about, instead it is important to consider themes like loss, family, and life/death in general. What Revenant has going for it is Leo's face (an automatic mass-hype generator), incredible production value (filmed in all natural light, very few special effects), an amazing supporting cast (I actually thought Hardy performed the best), and a director with a Midas touch. What it has going against it is the hype factor, that being that hype can rise fast and drop abruptly. I've also heard a lot of people say they didn't like the film or were bored by it. I was kind of bored the second time around as the epiphanic moments I had the first time I saw it were reminiscences rather than mental clicks. Revenant is the favorite right now, but I'd be kind of surprised to see the same director win Best Picture two years in a row. To counter, one must consider that the Golden Globes are always a good indicator, and this year The Revenant took best drama, director, and actor.

It may count against \"The Revenant\" that a film by the same director (Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu) won Best Picture and Best Director last year, and the Academy is likely to award it with Best Actor. I'm still at 20% for \"The Revenant\", because I don't want to be too far away from the consensus \"just in case\".  \"The Big Short\" is a comedy, and those rarely get Best Picture. Add to that that the Academy completely snubbed \"Margin Call\", an excellent film about the financial crisis, with an all-star cast, in 2012. My feeling is that they don't like movies about Wall Street or finance. Michael Douglas won Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" in 1988, but that's as far as the Academy's love affair with finance goes.

Also figuring in is that Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have just agreed to pay billion of dollars in fines for their roles in the \"pump and dump\" schemes associated with the bubble.

Jan 26: \"How Much Do We Need To Know To Predict The Oscars?\" http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-do-we-need-to-know-to-predict-the-oscars/ \u201cThe Big Short\u201d won the top prize at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, making it the new favorite in our model. Historically, the winner of that Producers Guild honor has gone on to win the Academy Award for best picture about 70 percent of the time. Even more importantly, many of the people who vote on it are also members of the Academy; that gives the Producers Guild prize extra predictive power. In our model, Oscar nominees receive points for being nominated for or winning other awards that historically predict the Oscars. The better a historical predictor a given award is, the more points it\u2019s worth. With 30 percent of possible points remaining to be distributed, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d has 19 percent of possible points, \u201cSpotlight\u201d has 14 percent and \u201cThe Revenant\u201d has 11 percent. \u201cThe Big Short\u201d now has the highest potential final score in the field, followed closely by \u201cSpotlight.\u201d It\u2019s increasingly looking like a two-picture race, but it\u2019s too early to count anyone out. ~~ It's worth looking at how things looked on Jan 22 (before the PGA Awards): http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fivethirtyeights-guide-to-predicting-the-oscars/ This race is the most wide open. There are many preceding awards left to go, and the field is large (eight films), which makes it hard to pick a leader. This weekend\u2019s Producers Guild of America awards ceremony should give us a little clarity; the guild\u2019s award for best theatrical picture is the second-most-predictive award we follow for the best picture Oscar. At the moment, \u201cSpotlight\u201d leads the race with 14 percent of all possible points locked up. It is followed closely by \u201cThe Revenant\u201d (11 percent of possible points) and \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d (10 points). \u201cThe Revenant\u201d won the Golden Globe for best drama, but it\u2019s important to keep in mind that despite the popularity of the Globes, the winner of that award matches up with the Academy\u2019s choice only about half the time. \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d has benefited from lots of nominations, as well as wins from the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. Whether that success will carry through to the Producers Guild awards remains to be seen. All the awards that have been announced so far have been voted on by members of the press, and while that group does have an inside track on perceiving winners and a means of controlling the narrative, it does not vote on the Academy Awards. It\u2019s worth noting, for instance, that \u201cBoyhood\u201d did very well among the press last year but \u201cBirdman\u201d won the best picture Oscar after thriving at the industry awards. \u201cSpotlight\u201d is ahead this year because it received the most nominations in the categories we track and thanks to its best picture win at the Critics\u2019 Choice Movie Awards, which are by far the most predictive of any of the press awards. What to watch: This is where we\u2019d greatly benefit from more data. Whichever film wins at the Producers Guild awards will pick up a quarter of the remaining points and will be guaranteed front-runner status until at least February. After that, the key event to watch will be the Directors Guild of America\u2019s top award. Any film that sweeps those two will be a strong favorite for best picture through the rest of February. If two films split them, we\u2019ll have a serious race on our hands. ~~~~ COMMENT: So -- \"The Big Short\" won the PGA Awards. The DGA Awards are on Feb 6th. I'm happy to stay \"heavy\" on The Big Short until those awards are handed out. If The Big Short wins there, then we can be pretty confident that's who'll win the Oscar.
