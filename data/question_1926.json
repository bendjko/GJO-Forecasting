The two countries that normalized relations with Israel as part of the so-called 'Abraham Accords'--the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain--of 2020 did so for varying reasons. The UAE and Israel had informal relations dating back to the early 2010s, which were primarily focused on economic ties. Full normalization in 2020 allows for billions in trade across numerous economic sectors between the UAE and Israel.  Relations between Bahrain and Israel go back decades, with an official Israeli delegation visiting Bahrain in 1994. The Oslo Accord in 1993 allowed for the establishment of trade missions between Manama and Tel Aviv. However, the Arab boycott of Israel due to the 2001 al-Aqsa Intifada cooled relations. There are reports that Bahrain and Israel maintained a back-channel through their intelligence chiefs. Relations began to warm when Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa at the 2017 Arab Summit denounced the boycott of Israel and expressed a desire to establish tourism between Bahrain and Israel. The two countries also share a mutual apathy with Iran, especially as Bahrain has a Shi'a majority that rose up during the Arab Spring.  Sudan's normalization of relations with Israel was a quid pro quo. Following Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's toppling by the military in the Spring of 2019, Khartoum was in the midst of establishing its first government since al-Bashir's 1993 takeover. Sudan was in dire need of economic assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but its listing on the U.S. State Department's state sponsors of terrorism list precluded Washington, which exercises tremendous power on the IMF Board of Governors, from endorsing IMF assistance. The Trump administration in 2020 made the normalization of ties with Israel as a condition of removing Sudan as a sponsor of terror and allowing for IMF assistance.  Saudi Arabia is a much different case. Even if the de facto ruler of the Kingdom, Crown Prince Muhamad bin Salman (MBS), sought to normalize relations with Israel, it is a very delicate issue in a country home to the two holiest sites in Islam. MBS for the past several years has sought to bring the Kingdom's conservative Wahhabi clerics under control. He has largely been successful in aligning the clerics with his ambitious social and economic reform efforts. Normalizing relations with Israel could lead to upheaval in the Kingdom. MBS currently enjoys informal relations with Israel through their intelligence services. Tel Aviv and Riyadh secretly deliberate on mutual regional security issues, especially as both consider Iran a significant foe. Put simply, MBS does not need to normalize relations with Israel. The main catalyst behind the normalization of relations between the UAE, Bahrain, and Sudan with Israel was the Trump administration. President Trump was desperate to announce a historic peace deal in the Middle East, with his first attempt to bring together Israel and Palestine having failed spectacularly. President Biden has not expressed an interest in committing U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli conflicts, as each of his predecessors dating back to Clinton have. President Biden would likely seize an opportunity to bring the Israelis and Palestinians, or Israel and other Arab countries, together. However, the conditions for a peace agreement and the subsequent normalization of relations between Israel and other Arab states currently do not exist.

Here, the median is 4%. In our initial forecast (https://globalguessing.com/metaculus-mondays-vol3/) some of the factors we were considering were:\n** Saudi Arabia's leadership dynamics\n** The situation in Palestine\n** Saudi government constraints\n** Biden's political priorities While there hasn't necessarily been a change in any of those factors since our initial prediction, there are two other factors that we considered that are the impetus behind our update. First, two months have passed since our initial prediction which lowered the odds for this question slightly. The downward pressure effects of this factor are only slight because recent months have been occupied with an election and COVID vaccinations, making the time remaining slightly more irrelevant. Next, we considered a recent report that Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said normalizing ties with Israel would bring \u2018tremendous benefits\u2019 to the Middle East. At the same time, however, the foreign minister also said that any change in relations would be predicated on a shift in the Israeli-Palestine situation.

There are a couple of variables that need to be considered. Historically, there have definitely been tensions and disputes between Saudi Arabia and Israel, but there have also been friendly relations and joint efforts between the two, indicating the possibility of official diplomatic recognition. Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of the most important allies for the US in the Middle East, share common interests that they have promoted in a discreet manner as well as share common enemies, such as Iraq and Iran. Though Saudi Arabia has been highly critical of Israel, it has never done anything to threaten it, instead opting for a mediator role to promote a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In December 2020, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stated that Saudi Arabia is open to full normalization with Israel, but it rests on the condition of Palestinian statehood, believing that establishing a Palestinian state will deliver true peace in the region. Its foremost goal is getting Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table and drafting a Palestinian-Israeli peace plan, so I think this is a key factor to consider when debating whether Saudi Arabia will diplomatically recognize Israel in 2021. Now that several Arab states formally recognize Israel, with the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan normalizing relations with Israel in 2020 through US-brokered deals, Saudi Arabia has stated that it will not follow their lead, despite its clandestine ties to the Jewish state. However, this might change as the US throws their support behind Saudi-Israeli relations as well as a two-state solution. Israeli PM Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed bin Salman allegedly met in secret in November 2020, discussing several issues, such as how to coordinate moves if the Biden administration rejoins the Iranian Nuclear Deal, but they reached no substantial agreements. This indicates a willingness to collaborate in furtherance of geopolitical interests. And though Saudi Arabia has maintained that it will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without a resolution to the Palestinian issue, the Saudi government has been pushing to change Saudi public opinion about Jews and to increase outreach to Jewish communities, especially to notable Jewish figures. Taking all of this into consideration, I do not see Saudi Arabia formally establishing diplomatic relations with Israel unless there are some efforts made by Israel to establish Palestinian statehood or to at least negotiate and draft a peace plan with the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia has placed its support behind the Palestinian people for so long that it is highly unlikely that it abandons the Palestinians to establish formal ties with Israel. However, with the new Biden administration restoring relations with the Palestinians, renewing aid to Palestinian refugees, and publicly announcing its support for a two-state solution, we might see some incentives implemented to encourage negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Israel has been historically opposed to a two-state solution (obviously), but as Israel suspended its plans to annex the West Bank in exchange for establishing full diplomatic relations with the UAE, we could see a similar compromise made by Israel in order to establish advantageous relations with Saudi Arabia. This could be impeded depending on the Biden administration\u2019s approach to relations with Saudi Arabia, as it has been reported that Biden has broken with Trump\u2019s approach, stating that the US would hold Saudi Arabia accountable for human rights abuses; however, Israel has warned the US that pressuring Middle Eastern allies on issues related to human rights could jeopardize Israeli relations with the Arab countries and indirectly strengthen Iran. Though it is important to the US that its allies align with its values, I think that the Biden administration might temporarily overlook Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights abuses (if they do not worsen) in order to continue to promote Middle Eastern stability, keep Iran under check, and encourage positive relations between Israel and Arab countries. If we were to see Saudi Arabia diplomatically recognize Israel in 2021, I predict it will be in a US-brokered deal in which Israel agrees to engage in negotiations with the Palestinians in return for formal recognition by Saudi Arabia. I think it is more likely that this will happen in 2022 after the Biden administration more fully establishes itself and COVID-19 (hopefully) is no longer a primary concern, but it is still possible we will see this happen in 2021, which is why I am giving a 30% chance of occurrence."], [59141, "2021-03-05T01:32:14Z", [0.1], "Biden or the Saudis seem to be chasing it "], [1333, "2021-03-04T14:16:09Z", [0.98], "The longer America puts off sanctioning this the more likely it gets that Israel and MBS decide to take the win for themselves in a Abrahamic Accord."], [81486, "2021-03-04T09:54:00Z", [0.9], ""], [98739, "2021-03-04T05:39:32Z", [0.05], ""], [79508, "2021-03-03T16:07:36Z", [0.45], ""], [98241, "2021-03-03T01:45:09Z", [0.15], ""], [34959, "2021-03-02T13:56:41Z", [0.03], ""], [68240, "2021-03-02T04:16:12Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2021-02-28T17:04:40Z", [0.02], ""], [94563, "2021-02-28T13:44:07Z", [0.12], "Upping slightly after the findings re: Mr Kashoggi and MBS.

It would be possible to use this in a negotiation however. It could be that Biden and MBS would find themselves in a negotiation about the stance on Iran, and MBS could use neutralisation of the relationship with Israel as leverage. It does seem though, that MBS wants a closer relationship with Israel as they have probably had their first meeting. At the moment it seems it is possible to increase bilateral trade and work together against the common enemy, Iran, without neutralising the relationship, which is something King Salomon is strongly against (2). It appears likely that the relationship will be strengthened and eventually lead to a diplomatic recognition, but other than the fact that other countries have recently done so, it seems unlikely that Saudi Arabia would act now. Especially considering that the relationship is still strongly tainted due to the situation in Palestine, and a senior Saudi prince expressed in December that to them Netanyahu's government was \"the last of the Western colonizing powers in the Middle East.\" (3) When it comes to other countries such as the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan recognizing Israel, like someone else wrote, it seems likely that MBS would wait and see what the outcome of this recognition will be. How will the people react and will it have positive benefits like an increase in trade. Finally, given everything above and therefore still quite a thin incentive to act now, the fact that only 6% of the Saudi population would support a diplomatic recognition of Israel (4) will at least slow the process. There is a beacon of hope in the same statistics though. 29% either did not answer or answered that they did not know whether they would support a diplomatic recognition of Israel. This could be an indication that people are torn or that they do not care too much. 1: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/11/25/saudi-israeli-relations-the-curious-case-of-a-neom-meeting-denied/\n2: https://www.timesofisrael.com/no-progress-on-israel-saudi-normalization-until-king-salman-has-gone-report/\n3: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-09/saudi-arabia-is-in-no-rush-to-recognize-israel\n4: http://arabcenterdc.org/survey/the-2019-2020-arab-opinion-index-main-results-in-brief/#section9"], [86358, "2021-02-09T05:51:29Z", [0.15], ""], [31279, "2021-02-09T05:49:50Z", [0.1], "If Iran attacks a Saudi interest"], [14208, "2021-02-09T04:44:04Z", [0.01], "Not sure.

Saudi public opinion strongly supports the Palestinian cause and strongly opposes recognition of Israel.[1]. Saudi leaders, as protectors of the most important sites in Islam, are especially fearful of a Wahhabi backlash by recognizing Israel.  Consequently, they have moved slowly, methodically, and cautiously in their relations with Israel.  It is easy to see how the Saudi Royal family would wish to wait and see and things work out for their clients, the Bahrainis, who just normalized relations, before doing it themselves. Outside case: The Biden administration has had strong words and signaled a clear break from the previous administration, referring to the Kingdom as a \u201cpariah\u201d regime.[2]  The Saudis realize they need to flip the script of bad press that they have in the U.S right now due to the disastrous proxy war in Yemen, the grisly murder of Washington Post contributor and U.S. legal resident Jamal Khashoggi[3], persecution of women\u2019s rights advocates, and lingering questions over Saudi complicity in 9/11. Nonetheless, the Saudis realize that a one time ceremony would do nothing to alleviate all the problems they confront in a skeptical Biden.  They would want to leverage recognition of Israel in return for substantial assurances for their core security interests.  That will take time to negotiate with the new Biden administration, which is currently reviewing its Middle East policy.
