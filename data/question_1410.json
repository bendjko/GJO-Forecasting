Its premium only-strategy seems to work out: product pricing is still in the upper range on average, still the product appears desirable to customers. Electrification, digitalisation and expansion of mobile communications into every aspect of everyday life promises lots of opportunities for secondary businesses.\nIt is, due to past squeezes in Tesla stock, at present more of a risk NOT to be invested in Tesla for large and institutional investors, which lays a floor at, say, 300USD.\nPossible news concerning a proprietary crypto currency for internal accounting would make sense to me in the near term, which could further justify valuation (which is not justified at the moment but a big bet on 2025 or later).

Many have also made tidy sum. From WalL Street Journal: \u201cFred Lande\u2019s heart was pounding as he watched Tesla Inc. shares charge to an all-time high of $968.99 last week. It wasn\u2019t because he was happy.\nHe\u2019d bet thousands of dollars that the frantic rally that has more than tripled the price of the shares in just a few months was doomed to end, and soon. Concluding his gamble was wrong, he closed the options trade at a loss. \u201cSomeone could go buy a brand new Toyota Camry with the loss that I took,\u201d said Mr. Lande, who frequently trades for his personal account and runs a chat room for retail stock traders. Tesla\u2019s rocketing stock has meant an astonishing dive for investors who have staked their money on the proposition that Tesla shares were drastically overvalued and bound to fall. Their cost: $8.4 billion since January. These investors have been mostly losing the battle for years, as Tesla shares remained buoyant even as the electric-car manufacturer racked up billions of dollars in annual losses. Their pain has suddenly gone from chronic to acute as Tesla shares have soared to heights that few of its supporters would have ventured to predict. Last year, they lost $2.9 billion betting against Tesla. In the first week of February alone, they lost $2.4 billion as Tesla shares posted a string of multibillion-dollar daily gains, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla reached its highest close on Feb. 4, at $887.06. Though shares slipped since then to close at $748.07 on Friday, the week saw a 15% gain, one of the best weeks for Tesla. Tesla shares have jumped nearly 79% since January.\nMany of these investors are short-sellers, who borrow shares and sell them with the hope of profiting by buying the shares back at a lower price later and pocketing the difference.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has made baiting the short-selling camp a prominent part of his prolific social media presence, which fans and detractors alike agree is a significant part of Tesla\u2019s mystique. This past week, he tweeted three fire emojis as Tesla\u2019s share price skyrocketed, which some speculated was a reference to how shorts were getting burned. One Twitter user responded: \u201cYou forgot to say something bullish about #bitcoin.\u201d\nIn 2018, Mr. Musk tweeted that short sellers were \u201cvalue destroyers\u201d and that short sales should be illegal.\nTesla didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nAdding to the short sellers\u2019 financial toll is a psychic one: Tesla\u2019s gains are driven in part by the short sellers\u2019 pain\u2014a \u201cshort squeeze,\u201d in which rising prices force short sellers to purchase shares to close out losing wagers.\n\u201cOh damn, I got my butt kicked,\u201d was the thinking, said Robert Majteles, a private investor who rode Tesla\u2019s swings up and down for years before being forced to close out his bearish position last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest set of losses that I\u2019ve ever taken in 20 years.\u201d\nShift in Sentiment\nTesla's short interest fell this year to itslowest level since 2010, when the stock begantrading.\nThose losses have become other traders\u2019 winnings, luring many more into the fray. Tesla has become one of the most popular stocks to trade ever. More than $55 billion worth of shares changed hands Tuesday, the most for a single stock since at least 1999. Options volumes have skyrocketed, as traders big and small look to profit from the car maker\u2019s wild moves.\nThe stock has been volatile in the past, giving short-sellers windows to declare victory from time to time. Tesla shares slid to a low of $178.97 last June as worries grew about Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to pull off his ambitious plans. They\u2019re up about 320% since then.\nThe battle between Tesla believers and skeptics has captivated Wall Street. As Tesla shares went parabolic\u2014the rare situation when the price chart of a widely held stock rises almost vertically over a period of days or weeks\u2014traders recalled previous short-squeeze episodes, such as the battle over wireless standards that drove a 2,600% gain in Qualcomm Inc. in 1999.\nIn one sign of Tesla\u2019s place in the zeitgeist, typing \u201cshould I\u201d into a Google search recently prompted an autofill that read \u201cshould I buy Tesla stock.\u201d\nFor almost every bullish investor, there is an equally passionate bearish one.

TSLA 0.88% ended 2019 with a near-record valuation thanks to a nearly 70% rally in the stock price since late October. But investors should be careful not to confuse a buoyant stock price with a sustainably profitable business.\nFourth-quarter vehicle deliveries, expected later this week, might keep the momentum going. Analyst consensus calls for Tesla to deliver 106,000 cars in the quarter, according to FactSet. That would be a record for the electric auto maker and amount to roughly 17% unit growth from a year earlier. Wall Street analysts expect nearly $50 billion in annual revenue by 2022, which would be more than double 2019\u2019s projected total.\nStill, evidence abounds that Wall Street should curb its enthusiasm. Hitting that figure would mean Tesla barely met the low end of its 2019 guidance, which originally called for 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries. At the end of 2018, Tesla said it was selling vehicles at an annualized rate of 350,000. While record deliveries helped Tesla eke out a small third-quarter profit, total revenue fell by 8%. The car company has booked a cumulative net loss of more than $3 billion since sales of the Model 3 sedan began in 2017. Delivery figures should be flattered by the fact that Tesla began selling its Model 3 sedan in overseas markets in 2019. Tesla hasn\u2019t traditionally broken out vehicle deliveries by country for investors, but U.S. automotive revenue fell by 40% from a year ago in the third quarter. The loss of federal tax credits for new Tesla buyers won\u2019t help. Evidently fleeting interest from U.S. buyers should raise questions about how long current strength in markets like China or the Netherlands can persist. So should the introduction of more electric competitors. With the stock now trading above 70 times 2020 adjusted earnings estimates and worth twice as much as Ford Motor Co. , Tesla shareholders appear comfortable.
