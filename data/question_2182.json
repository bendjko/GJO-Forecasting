For the past 5 months, the rate has remained at .8. However, one thing to consider is that the efficient fund rate is affected by employment, inflation, current conflicts, and political standings. Therefore, after evaluating the inflation rate within the past couple of months it appears that that has had a slight impact on the federal funds rate. Based on current situations, there are articles stating that the rate was expected to rise as much as .5. However, due to the situation that currently is happening between Russia and Ukraine, the government is only expected to increase it about .25 and go from there. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp#:~:text=The%20federal%20funds%20rate%20is,reserves%20to%20each%20other%20overnight.&text=The%20federal%20funds%20rate%20can,consumer%20loans%20and%20credit%20cards. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-raise-rates-wont-be-restrictive-90s-evans-2022-03-04/"], [105166, "2022-03-06T19:57:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "As of March 2, 2022 the Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at it\u2019s March 15-16, 2022 meeting.

This limit has been in place since March 16, 2020. This was the same rate in place from 2008 until the end of 2015. Between 2015 and March 2020, the rate fluctuated to as high as 2.5% between December 2018 to July 2019.  Inflation is inversely correlated to the federal funds rate in a system of fractional reserve banking, which the United States has. Inflation can be measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Between the higher target range of 2.5% federal funds rate of 2015 and March 2020, CPI varied only between 0% and 2.5%. And yet the Federal Open Market Committee regularly raised and lowered the federal funds rate during this time. In the last year, inflation is undergoing a much more radical change from 1.35% to 7.5%. During this time, the federal funds rate upper limit has not changed from .25%. However, such a sharp uptick in inflation would indicate a higher likelihood of an increased target. A clue is given by the FMOC regarding this matter. In a press release on January 26, the FMOC said \u201c. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.\u201d The question is whether \u201csoon\u201d could be assumed to be the next meeting of the committee with a decision to go into effect on March 16, or if \u201csoon\u201d means some other point in 2022. Forecasters from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia predict a higher near-term inflation rate of 5.5%, compared to an expected average of 2.5% over the next decade. Because of this continued indication of higher-than-average near-term inflation, I predict that the FMOC will raise the upper limit of the Federal Reserve\u2019s target range for the federal funds rate on March 16, 2022.

At first glance, there are three options so without any analysis that would offer a 33.3% chance of each occurring.  However, in my initial research I learned that the current target range is set at 0-25 basis points so essentially rock bottom.  I also noticed in looking at the historical data that the target range is generally adjusted in 0.25% or 25 basis point increments.  Given that, I would estimate there is little to no chance of the upper limit going lower, allowing me to rule out one of the three possibilities here.  The next step in my research was to examine the historical data for trends and volatility.  Given that the deadline for this question is relatively close (currently about two weeks) it would be important to know how often the rate fluctuates up or down and if those changes were connected to specific historical events.  According to the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the target range held steady at 0-.25% from mid-December 2008 until mid-December 2015 at which point it entered a period of relative volatility mostly increasing until mid-July 2019, then slowly declining until mid-March 2020 at which point it returned to the rock bottom 0-.25% where it currently stands.  Based on that preliminary assessment my initial thought was that the rate is likely to stay the same given it has been rock bottom for almost two years.  Since historical data shows a relatively sharp drop coinciding with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would think that is a significant factor for the rate being so low for so long.  As part of a class discussion, I learned of a transcript from a 26 January 2022 press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Powell in which he stated, \u201c\u2026an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate.\u201d  Given that the economy and life in general are starting to open back up recently, that would seem to track with a potential target rate increase.  Even after reading the transcript, I was still thinking there was a chance the upper limit could stay the same (.25%) due to uncertainty around the Russian invasion of Ukraine however that was mainly a guess and not based on any specific analysis.  A New York Times article from 3 March 2022 on this topic, explains that the war in Ukraine is likely to \u201cpush up gas and other commodity prices further elevating inflation\u201d.  Because it was explained in the transcript from 26 January 2022 that one of the goals of a rate hike would be to help bring inflation under control, I now feel more confident that the upper limit will be higher at COB on 16 March 2022 than it was at COB on 26 January 2022.

The historical data points that in times of great recession the FED lowers the federal funds rate to allow for more fluidity in the marketplace and attempts to stimulate the economy in this manner. Forbes notes about these actions in the 2008 lending crisis. \u201dIn 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered the fed funds rate to 0%, to revive the economy during the Great Recession. It did so once again in 2020 to minimize the economic fallout from the Covid-19 crisis. Lower rates make lending and credit easier for borrowers to get, which spurs consumer and business spending and grows the economy.\u201d This practice is very cyclical in manner as the FEDs once again lowered rates to during an economic crisis and was followed by a rate raise once the economy becomes more stabilized. A look at what rates immediately prior to the 2020 pandemic could provide a good gauge into the fiscal mindset of the economy without an immediate crisis occurring. \u201cTo provide more accommodation during the financial crisis of 2007\u201308 and the accompanying Great Recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to its effective lowest level, where it remained until December 2015. Over the next three years, the FOMC increased rates very gradually to 2.25 to 2.5 percent in December 2018. The Committee maintained that range until July 2019 when, citing the implications of global developments for the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, the FOMC voted to reduce the federal funds rate range by 25 basis points. The Committee reduced the range an additional 25 basis points in September 2019 and again in October 2019.\u201d As these indications talk about a range far above the target 0.25 top end that is currently in discussion. This along with rising inflation rates the highest since the 1980s the FED is going to feel political leverage to provide relief. O'Connell, B. (2022, January 10).

I've been afraid of these questions but I suppose it's worth a try. - Here's the first thing to know: the Fed has realllllly only raised rates once in the past ten years. Yes, if you look at the history (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU) there were a bunch of discrete rate hikes, but we basically had a flat rate of 0.25 for ten years, before the Fed hiked it in December 2015. Inflation was persistently low for that period, so I imagine the Fed's attitude was \"why mess with success?\" So, if inflation were low, I wouldn't expect a change. - Obviously things are a little different now; we're at 7% annual inflation and 0.5% month-over-month (December), which is importantly a 0.3-percentage-point decrease from November. It seems like normal month-to-month inflation is around 0.2-0.3%, which makes sense because that adds up to about 2-4%, which I understand to be in the desirable range. - The Fed's position is that the current inflation is caused by supply bottlenecks, NOT by too much money supply. If they unduly restrict the money supply, then once supply bottlenecks ease it will be more difficult to get credit, which could cause a contraction right as we need a recovery - and with what I perceive to be the Fed's new comparative focus on full employment relative to inflation, that seems like it's not that likely. - Yes, I get that we're apparently at full employment already. But wages are rising and it's not clear to me that curbing inflation is worth risking that from the perspective of a comparatively (with earlier generations) progressive Fed. - Yes, Fed governors are saying that they expect rate increases. But on the theory that inflation expectations lead to inflation, this seems as likely to be an attempt to curb inflation expectations as a genuine forecast. If they're focusing on messaging intended to curb inflation expectations, that may suggest they expect fundamentals that cause inflation to slow. - I think this will all change if January inflation numbers don't show continued improvement and a return to normal month-on-month inflation rates. If January seasonally adjusted inflation remains high, then I'll adjust my forecast. But I don't think the Fed will raise rates in the next two weeks.

With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer\u2011term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. \u201c \u201cThe Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.\u201d (link below) https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20211103a.htm\n"], [102430, "2021-11-08T21:33:50Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1], "As the economy recovers and covid decreases I believe the fed will raise the rate but the questions are when will they raise rates and then how fast. During the recovery from 2008 the first step up lasted for a year. After that it was raised about every three months. If they make any move up in Dec I will probably push Same even stronger as it would be the first tentative step and they will want to be cautious. If they have not made a move by Dec and the economy is still on track than I will move to Higher.
