Does this mean that ALL minimum wage hikes would be out of bounds for the newly minted \"third and fourth\" reconciliation shots awarded to this congress (over these next 2 years) or was it just the wording contained in the COVID Relief bill that could be amended to get it past the Parliamentarian (any legislative experts / senate procedure geeks out there want to weigh in on that one??!!)? Then there's the other bills taking a front row seat (notably voting rights which, after Infra, is likely to take up a lot of bandwidth). And the fact that, right now, Joe Biden and Co are riding high on record popularity with what they've already done (and therefore don't really need to push hard for another wage increase as a priority for right now). Lastly, we need to ask when is the most politically opportune moment to do this? -When popularity starts lagging as COVID passes and the slow recovery starts wearing at people's tolerance (and their wallets)?\n-Closer to the election to gain credit that is actually reflected in the voting booths (and mitigating the average American voter's goldfish standard memory capacity for political considerations)?\n-When Republicans (and troublesome Dems) will be harmed most by public obstinance and obstruction to it (see above)? With all the above in play, and with everything else going on, I think it seems more likely that, even if they could get it done by Q3 this year, Dems will hold onto this one until closer to election time to win hearts and minds in the build up to what could be a consequential mid term.

Most Blue states, and progressive districts, already have minimum wages above that proposed by Republicans. Additionally, Chuck Schumer is the Majority Leader and he has been working very hard to keep progressives on-board so I doubt he is going to look for a middling minimum wage compromise.

The Democratic majority in the Senate means they can only pass reconciliation bills, and the minimum wage isn't allowed to be in that type of bill, so it would need to be passed with the 60 vote majority that all other bills face.  The last minimum wage increase was in 2007 only 14 years ago and it passed the Senate 94-3 once tax credits for small businesses were added. The vast majority of Americans agree in every poll I've found in researching this that $7.25 is too low, the main stumbling block in both parties is whether $15 is too high for every geography. That said, Romney and Cotton introduced a bill raising it to $10 (and mandating E-Verify), and Manchin supports $11 tied to inflation going forward. There's definitely some appetite for it on both sides. There's a lot going against it though. Polarization is probably the most obvious. The Senate sucks at passing bills, especially bills on contentious topics, and it failed to pass one on this already. Even if compromise would be possible, Democrats wouldn't want to annoy the increasingly large left wing demanding $15 by going lower, and Republicans wouldn't want to give a win on that big of a talking point to the \"far-left\", or want $15 simply by their constituents' policy preferences. There's not really a stand-alone proposal that can satisfy enough people here. The main possibility would be through compromise on ancillary issues (hence Romney/Cotton's E-Verify inclusion).  Another big issue is that this isn't a predominantly federal problem, so a lot of activist pressure isn't going toward the federal government. The federal minimum wage is the wage floor of wage floors, since states can pass their own minimum wages. 29 + DC have already done that, not to mention city-specific minimum wages that are already $15 in NY and SF. Having higher wages in cities is less contentious, a lot of the debate around raising the federal level comes around mandating it in states with lower costs of living, and those states tend to be Republican. Many people are enthusiastic about a $15 minimum wage, but in practice they don't seem to direct their energies to a place (i.e. the federal government) where it would lead to national legislation. On the Republican side, $7.25 being too low isn't super controversial, but there aren't particularly vocal demands to fix it either.  The last difficulty is the idea that getting things done in Washington requires political capital, and this is currently a fairly low priority issue that would be big from a talking point perspective, and thus (I'm guessing) be costly from a political capital lens. The main goals of the Biden administration have been pretty explicit, and they've been about COVID, infrastructure, and climate, and all of those are massive issues to tackle. Per accounts of the Obama administration, lack of capital was the primary barrier to getting climate policy since he spent it all on healthcare. The concept is obviously a bit abstract, but its cited enough in political reporting and memoirs that I'm inclined to go with it. Climate is a huge issue, as is infrastructure, and together they're probably going to be a sole focus of the administration, leaving little for minimum wage issues. The yes case for this would probably be that a federal minimum wage raise to something that isn't $7.25 per hour could be quietly added to a different bill. State-level efforts can continue to raise the minimum wage in areas with high cost of living to satisfy the left, and Republicans can get compromise points for getting something done on a relatively uncontroversial issue while not giving into the $15 demands. Again, the minimum wage being higher than $7.25 isn't all that controversial, even among Republicans. The main issue here would be that any reasonable increase in the federal minimum wage would only substantively affect red states, so there may be little appetite for it among Democrats who'd prefer the $15 their constituents want. Considering the recent minimum wage bill didn't try to reach a compromise on amount and instead put forth $15 to predictably fail, it doesn't seem like there's much appetite for it right now.  The last consideration to take note of is the time frame. We'll still be exiting COVID by the time the deadline comes around, and unemployment will probably still be elevated, which a minimum wage hike would exacerbate. The budget resolution passed in February explicitly said no raising of the minimum wage during \"a global pandemic\" as one of the reserve funds parameters. Even if it would be for the future, discussion through August will probably skew toward job creation, which favors an infrastructure bill, rather than wages.  Overall, not impossible, but not much reason for it to happen. Raising it to above $7.25 isn't very controversial, but the recent history looks bad, the time frame is limiting, there's no great stand-alone idea, and the momentum at the federal level isn't there from activists or the administration. Weirder things have happened in politics, but I don't see much reason to bank on this one."], [529, "2021-04-03T18:56:40Z", [0.08], "Two-thirds of Americans reportedly support raising the min. wage to $15.
