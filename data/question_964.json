In fact, unless there are major set-backs, the two are meant to meet this week. In preparation for this meeting, a delegation of South Korean officials visited North Korea earlier in September to lay the groundwork for the upcoming meeting. The meeting appeared to go well as Kim Jong Un was pictured smiling and laughing with the envoy. Although the US and North Korea are going through tensions at the moment, because of South Korea's role as the mediator, I believe it would be very unlikely for North Korea to cancel the meeting with South Korea (or vice-versa) because South Korea has been acting more neutral as of recently, and wants to continue building dialogue with North Korea in order to build trust. In this quote, Moon Jae-in discusses his neutrality to the situation, and places South Korea on the outskirts of the conflict between the US and North Korea, \"The complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is an issue that should fundamentally be resolved between the US and North Korea through negotiation...But until talks and communication between the North and the US become more active, we cannot but work to mediate between them...President Trump and Chairman Kim have asked that I play this role.\"  Moreover, the two have already met previously this year, laying a solid foundation to their relationship. Lastly, because Kim Jong Un is eager to have another meeting with Trump, he will most likely want this meeting to occur between himself and Moon Jae-in. https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/world/asia/2018-09-17-south-korean-leader-steps-in-to-break-nuclear-deadlock-at-pyongyang-summit/\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2162792/south-korean-envoys-head-north-korea-bid-revive-nuclear-talks\nhttps://www.firstpost.com/world/moon-jae-in-calls-for-bold-decision-from-us-and-north-korea-on-denuclearisation-says-leaders-asked-him-to-mediate-negotiations-5159251.html\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/south-korean-envoys-hold-first-talks-in-north-after-us-halted-pompeo-visit/2018/09/05/337d9ed4-b07d-11e8-8b53-50116768e499_story.html?utm_term=.a7ff6503dcd7"], [57797, "2018-09-17T20:27:54Z", [1.0], ""], [34376, "2018-09-17T20:19:08Z", [1.0], ""], [43003, "2018-09-17T20:06:10Z", [1.0], "Whoops! happening tomorrow."], [43003, "2018-09-17T17:39:06Z", [0.98], ""], [1333, "2018-09-17T15:58:06Z", [0.98], ""], [691, "2018-09-17T13:49:33Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2018-09-17T13:22:10Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2018-09-17T13:18:50Z", [1.0], ""], [60887, "2018-09-17T08:16:51Z", [0.99], ""], [60887, "2018-09-17T08:02:14Z", [0.99], ""], [82, "2018-09-17T02:57:00Z", [0.75], ""], [60967, "2018-09-16T23:42:19Z", [0.95], ""], [23006, "2018-09-16T20:49:24Z", [1.0], "Following cdob63"], [691, "2018-09-16T20:07:39Z", [1.0], "They're on for Tuesday, barring a major cataclysm. http://theweek.com/speedreads/796213/south-koreas-moon-jaein-makes-historic-trip-pyongyang-tuesday?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_source=afternoon&utm_medium=09_16_18-article_3-796213"], [1333, "2018-09-16T16:03:10Z", [0.97], ""], [13377, "2018-09-16T08:41:38Z", [1.0], ""], [34725, "2018-09-16T06:37:40Z", [0.99], ""], [27155, "2018-09-15T20:47:14Z", [0.75], ""], [2965, "2018-09-15T14:30:12Z", [1.0], ""], [1624, "2018-09-15T06:10:42Z", [1.0], ""], [60987, "2018-09-14T23:46:26Z", [0.9], ""], [11686, "2018-09-14T20:39:41Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-09-14T15:44:10Z", [0.96], ""], [37379, "2018-09-14T02:09:50Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2018-09-13T12:41:12Z", [1.0], ""], [34376, "2018-09-13T10:34:40Z", [0.97], ""], [1333, "2018-09-13T09:31:53Z", [0.95], ""], [57778, "2018-09-13T08:52:13Z", [0.95], "https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/769774"], [57778, "2018-09-13T08:49:42Z", [0.9], ""], [60591, "2018-09-12T21:18:45Z", [0.93], ""], [172, "2018-09-12T20:25:42Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2018-09-12T15:47:26Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2018-09-12T12:23:14Z", [1.0], ""], [31450, "2018-09-12T00:17:26Z", [1.0], "Going to 100 because they currently have a meeting scheduled for later this month.

Citing an unidentified South Korean official, the Kookmin Ilbo newspaper reported earlier on Monday that the next summit could be held as soon as late August. The schedule had mostly been coordinated with North Korea and the summit would likely be held in Pyongyang, it said. A spokesman for South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said on Sunday officials hoped such details would be decided at Monday\u2019s talks.\nhttps://in.reuters.com/article/northkorea-southkorea-talks/north-south-korea-begin-talks-before-possible-pyongyang-summit-idINKBN1KY06E \"Pyongyang will be considered the venue by default under the joint declaration, but I do not believe we must say it can only be held in Pyongyang or that the venue has been set with no possible changes,\" Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told a daily press briefing.\nhttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/08/10/0200000000AEN20180810004500315.html A senior North Korean official suggested Monday that the leaders of North and South Korea may meet in Pyongyang, as envoys from the rival nations discussed setting a summit date and venue amid an ongoing nuclear standoff.  \"The discussions about the North and South Korea leaders' meeting in Pyongyang are underway,\" Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North Korean agency that deals with inter-Korean affairs, told the South Korean delegation in opening remarks Monday, according to pool reports. Ri compared the Koreas to very close friends with an unbreakable bond.  The meeting at a North Korea-controlled building in the border village of Panmunjom comes amid growing worries about whether North Korea will begin abandoning its nuclear weapons, something officials suggested would happen after Kim's summit with President Donald Trump in June in Singapore.  \"We will listen to the North's stance on the inter-Korean summit for this fall, which is agreed upon in the Panmunjom declaration, and share our views,\" Cho told reporters before heading to the border, referring to the agreement at the April summit. \n North Korea, which proposed Monday's talks last week, also sent officials overseeing past inter-Korean economic collaborations.  The meeting between Seoul and Pyongyang comes as experts see slow progress on efforts to disarm North Korea since the Singapore summit.\nhttps://newsok.com/article/feed/4789939/rival-koreas-start-talks-meant-to-set-up-leaders-summit ...With the meeting coming amid signs of a stalemate in the political situation as North Korea and the US butt heads over the war-ending declaration and nuclear facility/material reporting and inspection issues, and as North Korea urges the South swiftly implement the Panmunjeom Declaration\u2019s terms, observers are watching to see whether Seoul and Pyongyang can drum up some momentum at the talks and create improvements in their relations.  ...\u201cThis morning, the North sent a message proposing to hold high-level talks for implementation of the Panmunjeom Declaration at the Panmunjeom Unification House on Aug. 13 to review implementation of the declaration to date and discuss issues related to inter-Korean summit preparations, and we sent a message this afternoon agreeing to this,\u201d the South Korean Ministry of Unification announced on Sept. 9. ************ The ministry explained that it plans to \u201cform a delegation with Unification Minister Cho Myung-gyon as chief delegate.\u201d\n\u201cAt the talks, we plan to hold in-depth discussions with the North on ideas to expedite implementation of the Panmunjeom Declaration and the things that will be needed to hold a successful inter-Korean summit,\u201d it added. ...But North Korea\u2019s suggestion of \u201cdiscussions on inter-Korean summit preparations\u201d as an agenda item for the talks suggests some caution is warranted. The joint press release from the June 1 high-level talks included no mention of a summit, and the two sides have never openly discussed the summit issue at any of their minister-level talks since the first inter-Korean summit in 2000. The \u201csummit\u201d the two sides agreed to discuss at the talks appears to refer to President Moon\u2019s \u201cagree[ment] to visit Pyongyang this fall\u201d as mentioned in the Panmunjeom Declaration. Stressing that Seoul would first need to hear what the North has to say at the talks, multiple key Blue House officials cautiously predicted the preparations were likely for the fall meeting rather than \u201cone-point talks\u201d along the lines of those at a May 26 meeting at the Unification House.\nMeanwhile, another source suggested, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t focus too much on the Panmunjeom Declaration\u2019s language about \u2018Pyongyang\u2019 and \u2018fall\u2019 and rule out the possibility of a \u2018one-point summit.\u2019\u201d A source familiar with the situation in inter-Korean relations said, \u201cMy understanding is that South and North still have not reached any kind of agreement on a summit date or other specifics.\u201d The main practical issue is the need for the partial lifting of North Korea sanctions and other measures from the US and UN to make enough progress in inter-Korean relations to help jar the political situation out of its current signs of deadlock. This explains the cautious stance voiced by a former senior official and expert on inter-Korean relations, who said the talks\u2019 outcome would be \u201cdifficult to predict.\u201d Another source sounded a relatively optimistic note, suggesting that Pyongyang \u201cwould not have proposed talks in order to criticize the South.\u201d\nhttp://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/857113.html North Korea reproached the South on Sunday for siding with the United States\u2019 \u201csanctions scheme\u201d against the regime, saying such \u201cblind obedience\u201d was hampering progress in fulfilling the Panmunjom Declaration signed by the leaders of the two Koreas on April 27.  The critique came a day before relatively high-level officials from both countries were scheduled to meet in the truce village of Panmunjom. Local analysts believed the regime was sending a message in advance.  Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean government-run propaganda website that caters to audiences outside the country, said ongoing South-North cooperation in various fields wasn\u2019t leading to substantial improvement in bilateral relations and fell short at \u201cforming the atmosphere\u201d for it.  This was so, read the article, because Seoul was handling inter-Korean ties within the realm of internationals sanctions controlled by the United States. Pyongyang specifically vented its frustration about modernization work on North Korean railways and roads that South Korea agreed to assist, saying Seoul was only interested in aspects of the project that \u201cdon\u2019t require money,\u201d such as joint research. Seoul is refusing to take the initiative any further at this point, saying that the \u201cconditions\u201d haven\u2019t been met yet, read the article. \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s repetitive mention of \u2018conditions\u2019 refers to the point when the United States and the United Nations ease their sanctions against the North, or in other words, when the North gives up its nuclear weapons,\u201d read the Uriminzokkiri article. \u201cThey\u2019re stoically lying beneath the persimmon tree, waiting for a ripe persimmon to fall on its own.\u201d The high-level talks are supposed to begin this morning in the North Korean-controlled building called Tongilgak. South Korea\u2019s side will be represented by Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon; Vice Unification Minister Chun Hae-sung; Nam Kwan-pyo, second deputy director of the Blue House\u2019s National Security Office; and Ahn Moon-hyun, deputy director-general for the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.   ...The Blue House said Sunday that the meeting, which was requested by the North last Thursday morning, was expected to decide on the time and venue for South Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  Seoul believes that another leaders\u2019 meeting will help resolve an impasse in ongoing Pyongyang-Washington denuclearization talks. According to the New York Times last Friday, the North is insisting that the U.S. declare a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in armistice, not a peace treaty, before providing a detailed, written disclosure of its atomic weapons stockpile, its nuclear production facilities and its missiles.  Citing unnamed American officials familiar with the talks, the Times reported that the North has not even agreed to provide that list during private exchanges with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Washington has insisted that a formal declaration ending the war could only come after North Korea\u2019s denuclearization. \nhttp://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3051819\n"], [1333, "2018-08-12T16:25:01Z", [0.9], ""], [1333, "2018-08-12T16:20:54Z", [0.88], ""], [172, "2018-08-12T13:02:26Z", [0.9], ""], [57778, "2018-08-12T10:59:30Z", [0.85], ""], [40702, "2018-08-12T00:24:44Z", [0.4], ""], [23006, "2018-08-11T23:30:06Z", [0.44], ""], [1333, "2018-08-11T14:30:41Z", [0.87], ""], [1333, "2018-08-11T14:27:57Z", [0.86], ""], [35636, "2018-08-11T09:02:02Z", [1.0], "Still 0.75 324 from 202 (is the graph code here broken?)

Momentum (and already precarious trust in concrete/immediate change) was undermined after the snafu in Singapore (65%?) 2. S. Korean president wants to capitalize as much as possible on the current situation and works hard for small-level diplomatic endeavors (sports events, reducing border guard, military comm lines, railroads & roadways, forestry meeting, discussing economic cooperation between Russia/SKorea/NKorea, encouraging the US and ASEAN countries to continue to negotiate with N. Korea, etc) in the hopes of maintaining the momentum that is left (95% chance if it was just up to Moon) 3. US continues to keep talks with N. Korea private with little major agreements while negotiating smaller issues like release of soldiers' remains.  In fact, it seems likely that unless Trump's diplomatic & security/military officials can get concrete and clearly positive out of N. Korea, they aren't likely to bring up N. Korea since it makes Trump's \"deal\" look weak and ineffective, and does so in an unusually tense mid-term Congressional/Senate election year.  And given the face Trump has already lost, they probably want to report more movement from N. Korea than concessions from themselves...and to hold a stiffer line than they might have needed to if Trump hadn't said he'd be tough on a deal, conceded to an empty deal with little middle ground, and then been criticized for doing little or nothing and calling it great.  He now needs a bigger and/or more immediate win on denuclearization or similar concessions than a more moderated approach may have allowed.  So instead we see things like US officials sending out warnings over how N, Korea might try to negotiate commercial networks with neighbors so that goods produced in N. Korea can be sold as made in other countries.  All in all, this looks less than promising. 4. N. Korea continues to threaten pulling back from talking / completing agreements (like family reunions with S. Korea) / criticizing status quo (US should try harder & be less demanding/impatient, criticizing Japan, etc) while maintaining diplomatic talks with S. Korea and also working to keep negotiations going, sending representatives to China (again) to discuss reducing sanctions, etc. while giving up as little as possible (some new work on denuclearization again, perhaps not as superficial as last time and with the hope of showing a \"first step\" toward a \"phased\" denuclearization, public urging US to officially end Korean war, etc.) So they would probably welcome Moon, but probably can't offer him more than a handshake an some strong popularity back in S. Korea right now in exchange for a diplomatic visit.  Even Kim gets more than that out of a visit to China, and he's the much weaker party in that exchange.  S. Korea is the stronger party in this exchange and the only very enthusiastic and optimistic neighbor in all the discussions.  And while Moon might be generous enough to extend friendly relations as a neighbor, to return home with less than Trump got (which was remarkably little) would be deeply damaging to Moon in the long run, and he doesn't seem like a stupid or naive politician at all. So...maybe 10-15% chance given N. Korea's stubborn / proud resistance to giving up the little they have for diplomacy and economic relief. 5. China continues to be silent and strategic about allowing N. Korean officials to visit but doing little to exert power in the situation one way or the other, and that silence is even more pronounced in southeast Asia.  And although India with its growing market has shown interest in opening trade with N. Korea, they've been careful in what and how much they're doing, while also seeming to wait to see how things go.  As evidence of what can or should be done to encourage N. Korea or cozy up to them to get them to be more neighborly, 20-30% (more than it's been in a while) 6. Into this silence, Moon Jae-in has been pretty much the only person enthusiastically calling for continued or expanded diplomatic activities to test the resolve of N. Korea and build relationships that encourage trust and partnership in change even if it wasn't strong or genuine to begin with.  In fact, the more Moon Jae-in sends out press releases and speeches about N. Korea and how the US and other ASEAN countries should be taking advantage of the situation with warnings that the opportunity might be lost if others don't participate, the more I feel that he's working to strengthen a weak momentum that is losing ground, despite the show of ongoing diplomacy that peppers headlines on a weekly basis.  See for example https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korean-president-moon-jae-in-seeks-aseans-support-of-korean-peninsula-peace (40% directly against the 95% Moon would offer if it was only up to him) Overall, I wonder how much longer Moon Jae-in can hold out.  He agreed to a visit to Pyongyang in the Panmunjeom Declaration and clearly means to make good on his promise if he can.  But visiting Pyongyang for show and coming back with little more than some photographs doesn't really seem like Moon's style or politically beneficial.  He has enormously high support over N. Korea reconciliation at the moment. But an unreasonably high number of S. Koreans expect denuclearization that may come far more slowly and with less benefit than hoped or not come at all (as it hasn't in the past).  Which is why I imagine Moon is working on a lot of easy, visible diplomatic activities (as many as he can scrounge up, from the sound of it), than he is on moving forward on a trip to Pyongyang to discuss denuclearization.  Such a trip would be expected to connect to a real diplomatic win in some way for S. Korea, and I'm not sure it can right now.  Moon may also have been urged not to go by American officials until they have negotiated something more solid (or suggesting a multi-national summit to redo what the US wasn't able to do?)  Realistically, there is a lot more working against any positive or productive long-term resolutions in N. Korea, and I feel like the clock is ticking down and the farther from June's meeting that we get, the less likely things are to happen, despite Moon's efforts to keep things going.  And although Moon isn't far into his 5-year term, I think this makes it harder for him to sustain this effort in the face of things falling through and showing little.  If he were out soon, he could stake the last months or year of his term on this and at least be lauded for trying.   But new into his presidency, wanting to create positive momentum after a lot of problems in the last presidency, it makes sense that he would push hard on this once-in-his-lifetime opportunity to see if he can make something out of what has in reality been almost nothing so far.  But a loss will follow him and handicap any further expansive projects he might try, and a clear victory seems unlikely or at least difficult to sustain for any length of time.  He needs something to turn in his favor before the end of the summer or he'll have to start backtracking in the Fall.  I'd give his S. Korean support until the end of year before it turns very critical, and longer if he can gain some minor successes.  I think if he hasn't announced or planned a trip by August and made the trip by early October, it's definitely not going to happen. This is what Moon said in May:\n...\"[Moon] has clearly taken to heart what he sees as the lessons of that stillborn peace initiative.  One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program.  Another was that any deal with North Korea must be struck and carried out early in the terms of the South Korean and American presidents. This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did.\n     \u201cWhen we look back, the most important thing is speed,\u201d Mr. Moon told the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, during their meeting last week in the Demilitarized Zone, the fortified border separating the two Koreas.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/asia/north-korea-moon-trump-kim.html ...\"Unlike President Donald Trump's administration, \"South Koreans aren\u2019t wasting time defining denuclearization,\" Jean Lee, Korea program director at research group The Wilson Center, wrote in a note this week. \"They are pushing ahead with plans for reconciliation with North Korea \u2014 with or without the United States.\"\n     Moon has long sought to strengthen bilateral ties through economic development, tourism, and cultural exchange \u2014 known as the Sunshine Policy \u2014 that will define his legacy. And while his approach has been previously criticized for being too conciliatory, he appears to have robust public support.\n     According to a poll from the Asan Institute, a Seoul-based think tank, South Koreans' opinion of North Korea stood at a record high last month. Kim\u2019s favorability rating also hit an all-time high, exceeding both Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \n     \"Many experts criticized the U.S.-North Korea summit for its lack of detailed plans\" but \"South Koreans put more emphasis on the meeting itself,\" the Asan Institute said in a report detailing the survey results: \"Many, like President Trump, viewed the summit as a positive first step to the complete denuclearization of North Korea.\"  The poll showed that 71 percent of South Koreans considered the June 12 summit between Trump and Kim a success, with only 10 percent expecting Pyongyang to continue developing nuclear weapons.\n     But maintaining the positive momentum could be a challenge for Moon's team. \"If there is no tangible progress in peace talks and if North Korea fails to follow through with its agreement, it is likely that South Koreans\u2019 opinions will quickly change again,\" the Asan Institute warned.\n     Seoul's desire to forge ahead with reconciliation projects could also complicate Washington's negotiations with Pyongyang. As Moon expands his charm offensive, the world's largest economy is looking to press Kim's government on the logistics of denuclearization.  \"The more protracted the U.S.-North Korean negotiations, the more potential for a gap between Washington and Seoul on North Korea policy as South Korea makes moves to lift its sanctions to allow for economic partnership,\" said Lee.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/south-korea-increases-engagement-with-north-korea.html"], [691, "2018-07-19T12:12:09Z", [0.85], ""], [530, "2018-07-18T20:14:09Z", [0.8], ""], [10718, "2018-07-18T18:05:40Z", [0.77], "It\u2019s in the declaration, but DPRK has a tendency to overturn its agreements: base probability of 60% There\u2019s a lot of pressure on Kim due to sanctions to improve relations with South Korea and the U.S. by following treaties: adjust upwards by 25% to 85% There\u2019s also pressure on Moon to make a big win by improving relations with North Korea, but not as much pressure since South Korea has had worse relations than now towards North Korea in the past without anything catastrophic happening: adjust upwards by 5% to 90% There is, however a lot of volatility: - The possibility of further nuclear testing.

It\u2019s not clear what the specific contents of the assessment are, how the conclusions were reached, nor the level of confidence in its conclusions. NBC cites one \u201csenior intelligence analyst\u201d who noted, in indirect quotation, that \u201cthe decision by Kim to suspend nuclear and missile tests was unexpected, and the fact that the two sides are talking is a positive step,\u201d while also acknowledging that the North is trying to \u201cdeceive\u201d the US.  Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Secretary of State Pompeo has cancelled a July 6th meeting with an Indian diplomat to fly out to Pyongyang. The Department of State was tight-lipped on Pompeo\u2019s plans, so it\u2019s not clear if this meeting is related to the aforementioned intelligence assessment. If it is, then it shows that the US government, while alarmed, still views the situation as salvageable. Trump has staked quite a bit of his reputation on improving relations, so he has an incentive to try to keep the wheels from coming off as long as possible. Kim, for his part, also has a strong incentive not to rock the boat too much in order to extract maximum concessions.  All of this has no direct impact on the prospects of an autumnal Kim-Moon summit, but it does hint that the long-anticipated next belligerence phase in the up-and-down cyclicality that characterizes US-NK relations may be coming up soon. On the one hand, a deterioration in relations with the US makes it less likely that Moon will make it out to Pyongyang in September, but at the same time, it could also imply the possibility that Moon will head to Pyongyang sooner than September to try to salvage the current peace phase that has become the cornerstone of his incumbency, as he did when Trump cancelled the summit door the first time.   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna887926 https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1JO1WP"], [5018, "2018-06-30T04:18:34Z", [0.75], ""], [57778, "2018-06-30T03:11:58Z", [0.85], ""], [59612, "2018-06-29T17:03:03Z", [0.76], ""], [59612, "2018-06-29T17:02:24Z", [0.75], ""], [182, "2018-06-29T14:52:26Z", [0.83], ""], [59234, "2018-06-29T13:53:31Z", [0.6], ""], [59592, "2018-06-29T06:23:35Z", [0.75], ""], [53049, "2018-06-29T02:26:21Z", [0.66], "With tentative agreement between nations, for a Autumn visit, trending towards a positive result.\nUntil official annoucement of dates, and locaiton will temper the prediction noting how voliatile the relationship can be.\n"], [29033, "2018-06-29T02:20:52Z", [0.95], "At a policy forum on the 26th, Professor Choi Jong Kun, Secretary to President Moon Jae-in for Peace and Arms Control and one of the president\u2019s top advisors on North Korea issues,  remarked that \u201cPresident Moon Jae-in intends to visit Pyongyang in the fall of this year,\u201d in accordance with the Panmunjeom Declaration, while warning that more progress on denuclearisation and continued improvements in inter-Korean relations would be required, before September.

Korean media speculates it will be in September, although it may occur sooner. According to the South Korean daily Hankook Ilbo, citing reporting from another South Korean daily Joongang Ilbo (and it should be noted that no other sources are independently verifying the story as of yet), in the letter Kim Jong Un sent to Trump via Kim Yong Chul's White House visit earlier this month, the North Korean leader invited Trump to a follow up summit in Pyongyang in July. Although several South Korean sources have run with this story, I have yet to see any Western or English-language media reporting this. Nevertheless, if true, it is significant because the same source added that \"The chances are great that after talks in Singapore, a summit to declarare an end to the [Korean] war involving the US, South Korea, and North Korea will take place in July in Pyongyang.\" Moon, for various reasons, is reported to be very eager to hold a three-way summit. The Washington Post reported on this back on May 31. The post explains, using reported speech from an anonymous source, that \"the Trump administration is currently divided on whether agreeing to a peace treaty at the outset of the talks would give away a significant concession too early in the negotiations.\" It remains to be seen if this division is still in play, but at least some of Trump's advisors are open to the idea.  Given that both North Korea and the US proclaimed success in Singapore, and given Moon's enthusiasm to meet Kim again, a visit to Pyongyang before the end of the year seems quite likely, irrespective of how relations between Pyongyang and Washington play out.  http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0101_201806111431149478 http://m.hankooki.com/m_dh_view.php?WM=dh&FILE_NO=ZGgyMDE4MDYxMTE1MDMzNDEzNzU5MC5odG0=&ref= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/south-korea-may-try-for-a-three-way-summit-in-singapore-with-us-and-north-korea/2018/05/31/2b1b5d2e-64cb-11e8-b166-fea8410bcded_story.html?utm_term=.7609a3e26974\n"], [45198, "2018-06-14T00:50:54Z", [0.9], "The \"Summit\" has set a new opportunity and priority for increased diplomacy.
