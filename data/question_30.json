Greece's debt is worth around 180 percent of its GDP, a level experts consider unsustainable.\nDays after that agreement, however, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, announced that his government would distribute 617 million euros ($650 million) this Christmas to some 1.6 million low-income pensioners, replacing a holiday bonus scrapped by Greece's bailout creditors \u2014 and whose reinstatement had been a key electoral pledge by Tsipras' Syriza party.\nTsipras also said his government would restore a lower sales tax rate for Aegean Sea islanders who are struggling to cope with mass arrivals of migrants from Turkey.\nTaken by surprise by Greece's new spending measures, the eurozone creditor nations said Wednesday that they want more information on whether the costs will affect Greece's ability to meet its financial targets.\nThe eurozone's strong reaction was given added weight as it came on the eve of a year-end European Union summit where Tsipras is set to discuss the state of his debt-ridden nation with other leaders.\nTo further complicate matters, Greece is also involved in a public spat with the International Monetary Fund, a key bailout creditor, over the need for future spending cuts.\" ANA-MPA, December 12, 'Dep.

But little has changed': https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/13/greek-economy-still-spiralling-down-year-after-crisis-declared-over\nClips from Guardian article:\n\"They are far from being alone. A year after debt-stricken Greece received its third financial rescue in the form of international funding worth \u20ac86bn, such survival techniques have become commonplace. For a middle class eviscerated by relentless rounds of cuts and tax rises \u2013 the price of the country\u2019s ongoing struggle to avert bankruptcy \u2013 the draconian conditions attached to the latest bailout are invariably invoked in their defence. Measures ranging from the overhaul of the pension system to indirect duties \u2013 slapped on beer, fuel and almost everything in between \u2013 and a controversial increase in VAT are similarly cited by Greeks now reneging on loan repayments, property taxes and energy bills.\nAgainst a backdrop of monumental debt \u2013 \u20ac320bn, or 180% of GDP, the accumulation of decades of profligacy \u2013 fatalism is fast replacing pessimism on the streets. \u201cOur country is doomed,\u201d sighs Savvas Tzironis, summing up the mood. \u201cEverything goes from bad to worse.\u201d\nClose to half a million Greeks are believed to have migrated since the crisis begun, thanks to the searing effect of persistent unemployment (at just under 24%, the highest in Europe) and an economy that has shed more than a third of its total output over the past six years. The nation has been assigned some \u20ac326bn in bailout loans since May 2010 \u2013 the biggest rescue programme in global financial history. Yet the fear that it is locked in an economic death spiral was given further credence last week when Eurobank analysts announced that consumption and exports had also fallen, by 6.4% and 7.2%, in the second quarter of the year.\nThe duration and depth of the recession is such that the World Bank now compares it to the slumps seen in eastern European countries in the early 1990s. The poorest 20% of Greece\u2019s 11 million people have suffered a 42% drop in disposable income since 2009. Anti\u2013EU sentiment is on the rise. In October, 70% thought it better for Greece to remain in the single currency; by July those backing the euro had fallen to 50%. Real recovery can only come if the country\u2019s staggering debt burden is reduced.

NB: BRUSSELS has proven themselves time and again; especially today, on the immigration deal w/ Turkey, it is still in \"discussion mode\".

The IMF. A recent report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office ( IEO) blasted the IMF's approach to Greece \"...the injustice is that the cost of the bailouts was switched to ordinary Greek citizen - the least able to support the burden - and it never acknowledged that the true motive of the EU-IMF Troika policy was to protect monetary union...\" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/28/imf-admits-disastrous-love-affair-with-euro-apologises-for-the-i/?WT.mc_id=e_DM145300&WT.tsrc=email&etype=Edi_FAM_New_AEM_Recipient&utm_source=email&utm_medium=Edi_FAM_New_AEM_Recipient_2016_07_29&utm_campaign=DM145300; NB: actual COMPLETE EVALUATION report http://www.ieo-imf.org/ieo/pages/CompletedEvaluation267.aspx;  This leaves Tsiparis with another card to pull, during negotiations.

The Greek government declares that it is going to pull out. This is highly unlikely - the governing SYRIZA party, despite historic (and, in some quarters, lingering) suspicion about the Eurozone has repeatedly declared that it has no interest in pulling out of the currency. The leadership and mainstream of the party have repeatedly signalled their desire to remain; the implementation of highly controversial austerity measures (aimed at preserving Greece's EZ status) has ensured Greece's continued Euro membership at the cost to SYRIZA of significant political capital. A U-turn now would be politically disastrous for SYRIZA. Rumours continue to circulate that hard-line SYRIZA 'rebels' intend to try to force the government's hand in pulling out of the Euro; however, these have so far come to nothing and, at any rate, SYRIZA can rely on majority support from other moderate and centre-right parties in enforcing the status quo. Furthermore, the Euro remains popular in Greece, in spite of austerity. With no popular appetite for withdrawal, it seems most improbable that Greece will, itself, attempt to pull out. 2. Greece could be forced to leave by other Eurozone members. This would have some benefits: Greece could continue to use the Euro (there are few existing legal mechanisms in international law to *force* a country not to use a foreign currency if it wishes to - Monaco, San Marino, Montenegro and others all use the Euro despite being outside the Eurozone - and no means to enforce such a decision). This would have the advantage that the Eurozone would no longer have a responsibility for the Greek debt crisis, but that Greece could retain the popular Euro, albeit without the other benefits of Eurozone membership. However, in light of sweeping, controversial and damaging austerity measures imposed within Greece, to expel it now would be a PR disaster for the EU (at a time when it is already under threat from a potential British exit, and from the refugee crisis - in which Greece's cooperation is essential to broader EU strategy). As the Greek debt crisis has stabilised over the past months, it seems that an attempt to expel it from the EZ would achieve very little. A forecast of 5% reflects the faintest of possibilities that popular, anti-Euro sentiment may grow (perhaps in line with increasing support for the hard-right Golden Dawn Party, whose chief appeal is their anti-European stance); however, the boost to the Greek economy from summer tourism during the months of June, July, and August, and the incoherence and infighting that is increasingly typical of GD, make this highly improbable."], [26435, "2016-06-23T12:15:25Z", [0.0], ""], [202, "2016-06-23T11:38:01Z", [0.0], ""], [17879, "2016-06-23T08:30:30Z", [0.0], ""], [1269, "2016-06-23T00:54:29Z", [0.0], ""], [1078, "2016-06-22T23:33:25Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2016-06-22T21:08:38Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-06-22T19:28:38Z", [0.0], ""], [21320, "2016-06-22T19:12:27Z", [0.0], ""], [26365, "2016-06-22T17:38:46Z", [0.0], ""], [26241, "2016-06-22T10:47:09Z", [0.0], "1.

Greek debt deal: what was and wasn't included\nwww.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/25/greece-reaches-debt-relief--breakthrough---but-its-not-over-yet2\nAFP What they wanted was something concrete and decisive. What they got was vague and non-committal. Greece will receive enough bail-out cash to avoid a repeat of last summer's meltdown. However, the \"upfront\" commitment to debt relief that the International Monetary Fund had called for was too much for creditors to swallow. What did Greece secure? Greece unlocked a \u20ac10.3bn tranche of bail-out funds that will ensure the country can pay its bills, service its debts and repay arrears that have built up. The deal removes the risk of Greece defaulting on its \u20ac1.5bn due to the IMF and \u20ac2.3bn due to the European Central Bank this year. The ECB now has the green light to reinstate a waiver on Greek bonds as collateral, which will mean cheaper funding for the country's banks. Banks have been surviving on so-called emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Greek central bank since February 2015, when they were cut off from the ECB's standard lending channel. What about debt relief? Greece will have to wait until 2018 for any meaningful action to reduce its debt burden. The IMF wanted relief to start with the \u20ac10.3bn loan tranche agreed on Tuesday night, which it claimed would send a \"strong signal to markets\". But Greece could only secure \"smoothening of the EFSF repayment profile\u201d - which analysts said was likely to involve changing debt maturities due between 2017 and 2019 by pushing payments into the next decade. Removing extra interest payments on \u20ac11.3bn of EFSF (the eurozone's temporary bail-out pot) loans disbursed in 2012 could also help, the Eurogroup said. The IMF also warned that asking Greece to post primary surpluses (which exclude debt interest payments) of 3.5pc of gross domestic product (GDP) for ten years from 2018 had never been done in an economy so ravaged by recession. A target of 1.5pc of GDP was \"within the realm of what is plausible\". The Eurogroup stuck with the 3.5pc target. It also urged European creditors to look at the country's gross financing needs - or the money Greece needs to roll over maturing debt. The IMF's analysis suggested these would need to stay \"below 10 percent until about 2040\", rising to 20pc by 2060. The Eurogroup said debt relief would focus on \"capping Greece\u2019s gross financing needs below 15pc of GDP in the medium-term and 20pc in the long-run\". And in the longer term? The IMF wanted deep restructuring of all existing official loans to Greece (except its own) to get the country's debt share back on a downward path. Solutions could not be piecemeal. \"In other words, solutions that provide only temporary relief but do not deliver a declining debt path over the projection horizon would not be consistent with sustainability,\" it warned. The IMF called for maturities to be extended by up to 30 years, as well as a 1.5pc cap on interest rates and a moratorium on payments until 2040. The Eurogroup statement attempted to allay the IMF's concerns. Provided all targets were met, creditors would consider caps on interest rates and deferral of payments in 2018. It said it would also consider returning profits on Greek government bonds held by the eurozone to Athens. The Eurogroup suggested the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - or the eurozone's permanent bail-out pot - could buy-out some IMF loans, thus reducing debt servicing costs. Analysts at Citi highlight that there will be just \u20ac10bn of IMF loans left by 2018. EFSF loans could also be re-profiled via maturity extensions and interest payment caps, the Eurogroup said. These total around \u20ac131bn of Greece's debt pile. More worryingly, the statement suggests that these might not be needed at all and would only take place \"if an update of the debt sustainability analysis shows they are needed to meet the agreed gross financing needs benchmark\u201d. In short, the Eurogroup will be calling the shots, not the IMF. What's next? Poul Thomsen, the IMF's European director, admitted the Fund had made \"major concessions\" to secure a deal. However, he stressed that the IMF's participation was still subject to another debt sustainability analysis which it will produce later this year. If the IMF is satisfied, it will participate in Greece's third bail-out, provided it gets the go-ahead from the IMF board. Citi said there many questions were left unanswered. \"It leaves Greece\u2019s return to market funding uncertain and probably delays the inclusion of Greek bonds into the ECB\u2019s QE until public debt is deemed sustainable by ECB/EU,\" they said."], [689, "2016-05-26T01:08:31Z", [0.04], ""], [23262, "2016-05-26T00:14:00Z", [0.06], ""], [368, "2016-05-25T22:11:24Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-05-25T18:55:11Z", [0.0], "The new deal makes this even more improbable than it was a couple of days ago.  @BG1 is correct, of course--this is a can with a very long hang time."], [19801, "2016-05-25T12:45:28Z", [0.0], "Current news is that it seems far less likely than before."], [20035, "2016-05-25T11:28:05Z", [0.0], "Along with my previous posts, the improving economic condition suggests Grexit is increasingly unlikely: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-idUSKCN0YG01L"], [3363, "2016-05-25T10:07:45Z", [0.07], ""], [10898, "2016-05-25T08:23:20Z", [0.0], "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36375973"], [14182, "2016-05-25T08:23:07Z", [0.0], "http://app.ft.com/cms/s/0f432c22-2223-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d.html?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/FirstFTEurope/product Politics as usual in EU land.

The IMF is also pressing for Greece\u2019s interest rate on its eurozone loans to be fixed for 30 to 40 years at its current average level of 1.5%, with all interest payments postponed until loans start falling due. German leaders are confident that the IMF will soften its stand, people familiar with the negotiations say. The Washington-based fund is ultimately controlled by its majority shareholders, European Union governments and the U.S., who want a deal in the coming weeks that keeps the IMF on board and Greece afloat. But Berlin officials also know they will have to offer the IMF major concessions, engaging in a long-delayed debate about Greece\u2019s debt burden that Germany previously claimed wasn\u2019t needed.\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-wants-eurozone-debt-relief-for-greece-until-2040-1463468493 Comment: Interesting articles from the WSJ; what it is spelled out here is that the US, the EU, and the IMF want to avoid a repeat of the 2015 tragedy; in few words Greece is going to stay in."], [14667, "2016-05-18T08:31:32Z", [0.02], ""], [13365, "2016-05-18T07:13:59Z", [0.04], ""], [755, "2016-05-18T04:11:36Z", [0.3], "WSJ, May 17, 'IMF Proposal on Greece Sets Up Battle With Germany - Demands to let Greece skip payments on bailout loans for decades go far beyond what European creditors have said they are willing to do.': http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-wants-eurozone-debt-relief-for-greece-until-2040-1463468493\nClip from article:\n'A compromise between Germany and the IMF is needed by June, when Greece is in danger of running out of money to pay its bills, and definitely by July, when major debts fall due.

The biggest victims of these growth-sapping choices have been the young, who have had to endure sky-high levels of unemployment.\nThe difference this time is that one of Greece\u2019s main creditors, the International Monetary Fund, is refusing to sign off on the plan.

These considerations would make me revise towards a 1% lower estimate, if I was above it.

Analyst: Sam Rosenberg Date: March 22, 2016 1. Background: The eurozone is a group including many of EU countries which all have the Euro as the official currency of their country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone). Recently due to economic strains in Greece there have been talks and actions to try to remove themselves from the eurozone. In January of 2015 a man named Alexis Tsipras rose to power, appointing a new cabinet including a new finance minister (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_withdrawal_from_the_eurozone). Latter a referendum took place as to accept certain terms set forth in a bailout plan. The general population took a vote and decided to remain with the Euro. 2. Arguments in favor of a high probability:\nGreece is in a major debt crisis and \u201cGrexiting\u201d the eurozone could be a longterm solution to \u20ac86bn debt.\nIt has been a popular option before with 40% of the population, so it\u2019s not unreasonable the tides shift again. 3. Arguments in favor of a low probability:\nNational Bank of Greece says that leaving the euro would be disastrous for the country. Says that this would cause 55% decrease in household income along with many other terrible effects.\nIn Greece, there was a referendum in which the citizens of Greece chose to not separate from the terms of the bail-out and thus in the eyes of the European Commision said that the referendum is basically \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as to whether on not people want to leave the Eurozone which ended in a resounding no. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_bailout_referendum,_2015) \nPro-Grexit party received a very small percent of the vote in a past election.\nNo country has ever left the Euro (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32332221) Due to a previous failed referendum, lack of votes for anti-Euro parties, and Greek banks acknowledging the egregious effects that a Grexit would cause it is very unlikely that anytime soon will Greece leave the Eurozone. \n"], [10759, "2016-03-24T18:33:34Z", [0.04], ""], [4634, "2016-03-24T18:32:39Z", [0.04], ""], [38, "2016-03-24T16:17:09Z", [0.11], "Maybe the EU is just a house of cards.

Well, if Greece left the eurozone, then it would give up the Euro as its currency and re-introduce its own currency, the drachma. That would be, like, super-freaky disruptive[a] to the Greek economy for quite some time, but it would return monetary sovereignty to Athens, and that might eventually allow the Greeks to dig their way out of horrible circumstances in which they find themselves. How horrible? The Greek unemployment rate is about 25%[b], and Greek GDP fell from $354 billion in 2008 to $235 billion in 2014[c], and it's in recession once again[d], so growing out of this mess doesn't seem to be on the menu. These numbers are in line with what happened in the United States during the Great Depression[e]. So that's really, really, really bad. And the people who are responsible should probably be made into \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, but that's not my topic here. So where to begin with the likelihood of Grexit before 2017? Tough question. It's natural to look for a something like a base rate, but the prospects of Grexit seem more-or-less unprecedented under the current circumstances in modern Europe[f]. The current GJ consensus is 0.04, and has barely moved since September 14[g].  I suppose that's as good a touchstone as any. Now, there appear to be only 2 reasons that Grexit would be announced. First, Greece decides to leave the eurozone. Second, the rest of the EU comes to whatever kind of consensus it needs to in order to eject Greece. How likely is either event?  There are certainly plenty of economic reasons for Greece to take seriously the possibility of leaving the eurozone. I mentioned some of its macroeconomic woes above. 3 bailouts have not solved Greece's problems[h]. Greece's national debt is at about 175% of its current GDP[i], which is a crazy large number. History's largest debt restructuring hasn't worked[j]. In light of all of this, The Guardian reports: \"Businessmen and bankers in private concede that as the economy disintegrates the possibility of a parallel currency is now openly being discussed. 'The probability of Grexit is still there,' added Hardouvelis\"[k]. In order to get more debt relief from the IMF, Greece would need to tighten its belt to the point at which it's likely to crack it's ribs. In particular,Greece would need to engage in further austerity measures to the tune of 4.5% of its current GDP. How much is that? \"This translates to about 8 billion euros in austerity measures, something that would create an upheaval in Greek society\"[l]. Unsurprisingly, the measures needed to meet IMF goals are, in technical terms, super-duper unpopular among the Greek citizenry[m]. The only other possibility that I can see is a bailout extension from Greece's European partners. But even if there was an appetite for this sort of thing among EU decision makers, I'm not sure it would be politically possible[n]. It's no wonder that the Greeks are talking up Grexit once again. They've just about run out of other options.  How soon could this come to a boil? \"Greece has a 28 billion-euro loan program with the IMF that expires in March, but the Washington-based fund hasn\u2019t released any funds from the program since June 2014\"[0]. So pretty soon, I guess. I think a 0.30 probability is reasonable for a Greek led withdrawal from the EU in 2016. This is by no means a sure thing. Consider the fact that Greek bond prices are currently much lower than they were at the hight of Grexit talk last summer[p]. And I'm probably failing to site a lot of contrary evidence, but it's Sunday, and I'm lazy, so sue me. What about an EU ejection of Greece? It's not up for discussion, says one source[q]. Well, one thing's for sure, EU elites are not discussing this in public (at least as far as I can tell). I'm sure there are a lot of folks in Brussels and elsewhere who would love to see both Greece's financial problems and its proximity to refugees and migrants from Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere removed with the single stroke of a pen. The EU has just put about $3 billion into staunching the flow of desperate people from more troubled parts of the world[r], about a million of whom arrived in Greece last year[s].  But I have my doubts about whether the EU will act directly to eject Greece. It seems more likely that it will continue to treat Greece like an employee that it wants gone but can't manage to fire: Give him bad hours, make his life hell, and he'll leave on his own. For now, I'd rate the probability that the EU will eject Greece this year at 0.02. So that leave's us with a 0.32 probability that Greece will leave the eurozone in 2016. That's a long way from GJ consensus!

Many notable economists (Krugman in the frontline) advocated a return to the mother-currency; and I am an absolute nobody to dare contradict Krugman, but during my work I learned one thing: that econometric models do not work, one needs to have his \"economic\" hands-on in order to figure things out, and still be wrong at times. Economy is a science, but not a perfect one. They say is like weather forecast; no matter how well you know the present situation, what happens tomorrow may be influenced by so many different factors that a precise prediction is almost impossible, except \"have always your umbrella handy.\" \nThat is why the IMF last word is more qualified; the staff deals with the authorities and have a better picture to analyse, since the country is forced to show their balance sheets. [PS: when in the list of countries at the IMF, if you do not see the Art. IV for a while it is because the authorities asked not to publish, hence smell \"fishy\" right away! See Venezuela for example, scroll to Feb 1, and you will see that they refused to publish http://www.imf.org/external/country/VEN/index.htm the wording is delicate, but that is what it means :-) \nIn the case of Greece, the IMF is NOT recommending that it leaves the Euro area; and the reason we had the Troika at the beginning was that their debt was considerable, the IMF could not lend that much to Greece, in case Italy and Spain needed also a loan, the IMF could not have provided for all; and Italy is far a bigger economy not to worry about. So there was the Troika agreement and the ECB had to create the lending mechanism to be able to be part of the 3 lenders. \nI think that these are also important factors to keep in mind when one considers a Grexit. A year ago, the German MOF and probably Draghi too were quite fed up with the rock-star silliness of Varoufakis hence they were considering a \"temporary\" exit. The new MOF seems much more knowledgeable and aware of the situation, so the relations so far are more normal. But the guarantee for lending to Greece is that the all 3 institutions are on it; so if Greece leaves the Euro the IMF will guarantee much less since the ECB will be out of the lending part (do i make sense?) \nPersonally I don't see either Brexit or Grexit but I just said above about the weather.

There will probably be noise about this in Feb/Mar. \nNo new program: current program expires in March. The participants (except IMF) seem willing to renew.

It's never happened. The same relevant actors are likely to be in place in Greece until the expiry of this question. They have demonstrated they will go to great lengths to meet creditor demands and the Greek public overwhelmingly wants to stay in the monetary union.  Discord and tensions driven by the migrant influx (tightening of border controls and attempted imposition of quotas) could push things in either direction. Either it could make it more difficult to cut a deal to restructure or secure financing, if necessary, or it could mean the relevant actors will be more willing to cut a short term deal to push this off the agenda so they can focus on the migrant issue. Since I have no good reason to lean one way or the other I am discounting this.  Another consideration, I have long thought it would be in Greece's longer term (3-5+ years) interest to get out of the Euro zone. Since i think this is more likely true than not there is always the chance enough relevant actors may also reach this conclusion in time to make an announcement before the question closes. This pushes me up two percentage points.  FInally, it is my belief that the Euro zone, as currently constructed with this many members, is unssustainable, so I do expect at least one country to leave at some point. Greece would be one of the more likely first candidates. Given the time sensitivity of the question, though, this cannot count for much. I'll say one percentage point.

Like many political issues, we can look to game theory and what each side knows, both of their own position and that of their opponent(s), to predict an outcome. Financial: Yes, the country is already under enormous negative financial pressure from imposed austerity measures, and leaving the EU could potentially remove this yoke (a short term gain). However, an exit would result in large financial losses for all entities that have propped up the country thus far, and these entities would likely refuse to do business with Greece in the long term should the country try to so dramatically escape its debt. Further, while the world economy continues to limp along, things are improving and Greece will share at least somewhat in this growth. Said growth will lighten the yoke of austerity (though only slightly), decreasing the benefit to Greece of an EU exit. All told, while Greece's books don't look good now and both sides would be worse off financially with a Grexit, Greece would suffer more long term and all parties know it. Political: The departure of Greece would be a huge political blow to the EU. This is evident both in explicit statements from EU member-states and in their willingness to continue propping up the country. On the other hand, Greece's primary leverage to bargain for better financing terms is the threat of a Grexit. Greece's latest leader came to power essentially promising to use this strategy, yet the results for Greece have been muted. This demonstrates the balance of political power is with the EU. Further, the current refugee crisis has taken center stage, making it difficult for Greece's debt to get political attention.

Greece exits the Eurozone willingly\n2. Greece is forced out of the Eurozone\n3. External factors (Global economic meltdown, geopolitical catastrophes, WWIII, etc.) For this analysis we will treat the probability for cause 3 as negligible and focus on causes 1 and 2: 1. As of the most recent opinion polls, Eurozone membership is strongly supported by the Greek population (see [1], Eurobarometer 83, page 26). Unfortunately the poll is outdated, as it was conducted in May 2015 and hence before the crescendo of the Greece crisis this summer. However, a number of more recent, commercial polls have suggested that the numbers are still quite similar to the May 2015 levels: 69% support Eurozone membership, with 29% opposed and 2% undecided. Coincidentally, Greek support was above the EU28 average of 57%. Political viability for a willing Grexit is, in my opinion, conditional on a similar 2/3 majority against membership. The last couple of months have showed us the amount of stress the Eurozone membership support is able to bear and I would hence expect that we would need to see at least similar levels of political discord for there to be a threat of deteriorating support. The probability for a similar environment to develop before 01/01/2017 is quite low in my opinion, however the potential is certainly there (see repayment schedules, debt sustainability issues etc.). I would put the probability of a willing exit at roughly 10%. 2. The probability of Greece being forced out of the single currency union is slightly lower at around 5% in my opinion. Whilst the last couple of months have certainly reinforced my belief that in the current political leadership no one wants a Grexit, we have come closer to this scenario than many had anticipated. The first question is therefore not whether similar levels of discord between member states, as we have seen this summer, will lead to a forced Grexit, but whether there is a risk of a significant leadership change in an influential Eurozone country (namely Germany, France and maybe Spain). France\u2019s and Germany\u2019s next general elections are scheduled for Q2CY17 and Q3CY17 respectively, leaving only the less significant Spanish election in Q4CY15, which is marked by the rise of the left-wing Podemos party, which is trailing the ruling People\u2019s Party (27%) at 15% (see [2], Opinion polling for the Spanish general election, 2015). The probability of it rising into a power position (through a coalition) is given but fairly low in my opinion and it having a significant effect on inter-european politics until 01/01/2017 even lower. We are therefore left with our earlier question: Will we see stress levels rivalling the Summer of 2015 in the coming year and will this lead to a forced Grexit? As seen above, I see the probability for an event like this at around 5%. To sum up: Barring major political changes and geopolitical shocks, I see the current situation as relatively sticky - meaning, we would need to see significant events for there to be enough momentum for a change in the public support for a willing Grexit or change in willingness in the other Eurozone countries for a forced Grexit. The situation needs to be monitored, but currently I put the total probability at around 7%.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had walked away from talks with the so-called \"troika\" of creditors, saying the reforms they wanted in exchange for unlocking additional bailout funds were unacceptable. He urged the Greek people to vote the agreement down, and the electorate gleefully complied. Tsipras would ultimately send the troika a new proposal that included nearly all the changes the international community had been asking for. Greece's creditors, led by Germany, responded that they no longer trusted Tsipras to make good on his word and asked for additional concessions. The Greek Parliament reluctantly approved the required measures July 15, paving the way for a new bailout deal worth more than \u20ac80 billion.   From <https://reason.com/archives/2015/10/01/grexit-on-ice>  --- Oct 2, 2015 Greece\u2019s public debt, expressed in comparison with its annual economic output, has continued to rise, however many bailouts and reform packages it passes through. To reduce those debt levels substantially would require implausibly fast economic growth, sustained over many years, a prospect made even less likely by the country\u2019s need under its bailout agreements to run budget surpluses. The European public is not stupid. It knows that the end of the story has not yet been reached, and will not have been reached until something is done to relieve Greece, and perhaps other major debtors, of some of their debt burden. This is the view now being pressed by the International Monetary Fund. It has pulled back from the financial rescue package for Greece until debt relief has been discussed seriously and in some manner secured. If European governments are to restore confidence in their own policies, and in the future of the euro, they surely need to follow the IMF\u2019s lead.   From <http://www.politico.eu/article/how-to-fix-europe/>  --- The Financial Times and Radio Free Europe reported on SYRIZA's ties with Russia and extensive correspondence with the Russian political scientist Aleksandr Dugin.[50][51] Early in the SYRIZA-led government of Greece, the Russian President Vladimir Putin and Alexis Tsipras concluded a face-to-face meeting by announcing an agreement on boosting investment ties between the two nations.[52] Alexis Tsipras also said that Greece would seek to mend ties between Russia and EU through European institutions. Tsipras also said that Greece was not in favour of Western sanctions imposed on Russia, adding that it risked the start of another Cold War.[53][54] Following the acceptance by Tsipras and the SYRIZA government of the third Memorandum with the European Union on Greece's debt, 25 SYRIZA MPs who rejected the terms of the bailout, including the party's Left Platform and the Internationalist Workers Left faction, split to form a new party Popular Unity (Greek: \u039b\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03ae \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, La\u00efk\u00ed En\u00f3tita). They were led by Panagiotis Lafazanis.[57]\nHaving lost his majority in the Greek Parliament, Tsipras resigned as Prime Minister on 20 August 2015, and called a fresh election[58] on 20 September 2015.\nAlthough polls suggested a close contest between SYRIZA and New Democracy, in the event SYRIZA led ND by 7%, winning 145 seats. Popular Unity polled below the 3% threshold and therefore had no parliamentary representation. Tsipras renewed SYRIZA's previous coalition agreement with the Independent Greeks, giving the new government 155 seats out of 300 in the Greek Parliament.  From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriza>  --- Sept 26, 2015 Syriza\u2019s win gave Mr Tsipras a fresh mandate to keep Greece in the euro zone. To do so, the new government must immediately increase taxes, cut pensions and accelerate the privatisation of state-owned companies\u2014reforms Mr Tsipras defiantly opposed during his first term. That was before the threat of an involuntary \u201cGrexit\u201d made him accept a new \u20ac86 billion ($95 billion) bail-out by Greece\u2019s creditors\u2014and their conditions. Like earlier Greek leaders in trouble, Mr Tsipras has executed an ideological kolotoumba, or somersault. The question now is whether the rest of Syriza can flip over as well.\n\nOn election night, Mr Tsipras sounded more pragmatic than after his first win in January. He told a flag-waving crowd there were difficulties ahead, but that with \u201cpersistence\u201d (rather than, say, \u201cresistance\u201d) they could be overcome. His revamped cabinet includes Euclid Tsakalotos, the Oxford-educated economist who negotiated the bail-out, as finance minister. The deputy finance minister, George Chouliarakis, led Greece\u2019s number-crunching team in the negotiations. Mr Tsakalotos, a lifelong Marxist, suffered doubts before agreeing to take the job. But there is wriggle room in the bail-out deal to soften the impact of rapid market reforms. Meanwhile, Mr Tsakalotos leads the Group of 53, now the farthest-left internal group in Syriza since the extremist Left Platform defected and triggered the election. The Group of 53 will do its best to salvage some of Mr Tsipras\u2019s lost idealism. Yet the prime minister and his team are far from re-inventing themselves as social democrats. Rather than forming a coalition with Greece\u2019s moderate pro-European left, Mr Tsipras turned to the coalition partner from his first term: the Independent Greeks, a right-wing nationalist party that touts conspiracy theories and wants to deny Syrian refugees even temporary asylum in Greece. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, called it \u201cbizarre\u201d that Mr Tsipras should keep in with \u201cthis strange far-right party\u201d. The new cabinet also retains some of Syriza\u2019s fiercest critics of capitalism. Panos Skourletis kept his job as minister for energy and environment, signalling that the new Syriza-led government has no plans at present to make concessions to the private sector. Mr Skourletis cited environmental grounds to revoke permits granted to a Canadian gold-mining company for a \u20ac1 billion investment, the largest in Greece for two decades\u2014even though they had been approved by Greece\u2019s highest legal body. He has refused to reconsider despite protests by hundreds of mine workers desperate to keep their jobs. From <http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21667963-prime-minister-pivots-away-leftism-and-his-party-follows-synchronised-somersault>  ---\nAugust 12, 2015 Greece agreed to harsh terms for a new three-year bailout Tuesday and vowed to push it through Parliament this week, despite mounting dissent in the ruling left-wing party.\nWith the country facing the risk of a debt default next week, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had sought to speed up the talks. After Greece and its creditors reached an accord on the main points on Tuesday, Tsipras called for an emergency session of Parliament for a vote late Thursday.\n\nGreece needs to start tapping the new bailout \u2014 worth 85 billion euros ($94 billion) \u2014 so it can make a key debt repayment next week and secure its future in the euro. Dissenters in Tsipras\u2019s left-wing Syriza party, who want to end bailout talks and return to a national currency, promised to fight the deal, describing it as a \u2018\u2018noose around the neck of the Greek people.\u2019\u2019 The agreement still requires approval from higher-level representatives, and senior finance officials from the 28 EU nations were holding a conference call Tuesday. From <https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/08/11/greece-accepts-harsh-new-bailout-terms-vows-swift-vote/zgvr8kMbXJgTg6Oz1rvg8L/story.html>  --- July 7, 2015\nAs the cash in Athens begins to run out following the rejection of European Union-led austerity measures Sunday, funding for Greece\u2019s bloated military is also quickly disappearing, inadvertently turning the country into a political pawn in the growing standoff between the Western-led NATO, of which Greece is a member, and Russia. Just one day after Greece's historic referendum on a new debt relief plan,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0contacted\u00a0Greece\u2019s left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to express support for the Greek people, cementing the growing relationship between the two that has been building since Tsipras was elected\u00a0more than six months ago. For Western leaders looking on, the budding friendship\u00a0has raised eyebrows and accusations that Moscow is driving a divide-and-conquer strategy aimed at bringing Greece under its sphere of influence and undermining the EU\u00a0and NATO. While Greece has been a less active member of NATO than its allies since joining in 1952, it has still regularly been one of the highest-spending countries among the 28-member alliance, mostly because of its fear of neighboring Turkey. This year, Greece put aside 2.4 percent of its $238 billion GDP to spend on defense, making it the second-highest NATO spender behind the United States with 3.6 percent of GDP. It has even defied the European trend and its financial collapse by increasing defense spending this year by 0.1 percent, according to NATO. Around 74 percent of its military spending has been for personal expenses, such as pensions and salaries, a clear example of the country\u2019s bloated public sector, and it's unlikely that Athens will be able to sustain such spending.\n\n The United States currently operates a small naval base on the island of Crete, known as Souda Bay, where U.S. forces run many of their North African operations from, including the Special Forces attacks on Tripoli in the aftermath of the U.S. Embassy attacks in 2012. But those operations could be halted if Greece cannot pay the hundreds of locals that help run the base.\n\nFrom <http://www.businessinsider.com/greece-is-quickly-becoming-a-pawn-between-nato-and-russia-2015-7>  --- Jul 19, 2015 On Friday, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press that Russia would be willing to lend Greece the money it needs to survive its debt crisis.  \u201cIf the Greeks ask for a loan then we will consider it, but they have not yet asked,\u201d Peskov told the AP. \u201cWe would do this because they are our partners and this is a normal practice between countries who are partners.\u201d\n ---\nDue to the cultural, religious and historical ties between the two nations, from medieval to modern times (Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus' comprised part of what today is known as the Eastern Orthodoxy), Greece and Russia today enjoy strong diplomatic relations and consider each other a brother nation. Russia assisted Greece in the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire. Today, many Greeks live in the Russian Federation and many Russians live in Greece. Most Greeks live in the Russian Black Sea region (100,000) with large concentrations in capital Moscow (80,000) and St. Petersburg (3,000), while many Russians live mostly in the Khalkidiki region and the Greek isle of Crete. Despite Greece's membership in the EU and NATO, the country's friendship with Russia has many years of fine traditions. Due to the common interests and shared religious heritage of both countries, Greece and Russia enjoy excellent relations which is reflected by the fact that both states are co-operating in several fields, and especially in trade, culture, energy, military and tourism. There are regular high-level visits between the two countries, and frequent contacts between the ruling political parties (especially between the New Democracy (Greece) and the United Russia), as well as between the ministries and agencies, on various matters concerning individual sectors. Greece is one of the few pre-1990 NATO member countries (alongside Germany for a time) that makes extensive use of Russian weapons. Greece first received many Soviet-era surplus weapons, such as BMP-1 armoured fighting vehicles, RM-70 rocket launchers, ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns and SA-8 anti-aircraft missile systems from the former East German National People's Army inventory in the early 1990s. Since then, Greece has additionally procured the TOR M-1 and S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems (the latter originally destined for Cyprus), the Kornet-E anti-tank missile, AK-74M assault rifles and ZUBR hovercrafts. The militaries of both countries also participate in programmes of military cooperation in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, as well as giving military support and training to countries that they have close relations with, such as Armenia, with Greece often accepting Armenian military officials in the Hellenic Military Academy. The religious ties between the two nations with majorities of both countries adhering to the Eastern Orthodox Church, has played a major role in Greek\u2013Russian relations. \n\nFrom <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece%E2%80%93Russia_relations>\n"], [2541, "2015-10-03T17:20:53Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2015-10-03T14:56:30Z", [0.0], ""], [837, "2015-10-03T14:52:54Z", [0.15], ""], [3710, "2015-10-03T12:06:20Z", [0.0], ""], [3640, "2015-10-02T21:41:43Z", [0.3], ""], [1733, "2015-10-02T16:33:25Z", [0.09], "Baseline is Oddschecker which has a 3% chance before the end of *2015*.
