While Mr. Delrahim has been on the sidelines awaiting confirmation, the department has been deep into its investigation of the effects of the deal, which would combine a top wireless and cable provider with a major U.S. media and entertainment company.  \"Mr. Delrahim, in answers to senators during the confirmation process, left himself room to maneuver. The AT&T deal is a vertical merger -- a transaction that combine firms at different parts of the supply chain -- and Mr. Delrahim noted that antitrust scholars generally believe vertical mergers raise less serious concerns than mergers that combine head-to-head competitors. But he also said there can be times when a vertical merger could have anticompetitive effects.  \"Just because a transaction or particularly types of transactions have been approved in the past does not mean that they could not raise competitive concerns in the future,\" Mr. Delrahim wrote in response to questions from Sen. Al Franken (D., Minn.), who has voiced objections to the AT&T deal.  \"Mr. Trump during the campaign said AT&T shouldn't be allowed to buy Time Warner, which owns CNN, because it would allow too much concentration of power in one company. Some Democrats have raised concerns that the merger could give AT&T the ability to impede the distribution of video content created by competitors, but they have likewise expressed concern that the president might attempt to use the government antitrust approval process as a way to exert leverage over CNN, a network Mr. Trump has criticized repeatedly for its coverage of him.  \"When he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in May, Mr. Delrahim pledged that his antitrust enforcement decisions would be free from political influence from the White House. \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:   Given how important this decision is, and that it is somewhat controversial, I just don't think this merger is going to get the green light in the next 2 days.\n"], [212, "2017-09-28T05:54:31Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-28T00:57:08Z", [0.0], ""], [14253, "2017-09-28T00:10:44Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2017-09-27T23:05:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-09-27T21:13:26Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-27T20:42:59Z", [0.0], ""], [38553, "2017-09-27T20:03:46Z", [0.02], ""], [23006, "2017-09-27T19:10:31Z", [0.0], ""], [15621, "2017-09-27T18:09:09Z", [0.02], "passage of time"], [32122, "2017-09-27T15:04:35Z", [0.01], ""], [30594, "2017-09-27T14:29:24Z", [0.04], ""], [11080, "2017-09-27T13:19:02Z", [0.02], ""], [11080, "2017-09-27T13:18:13Z", [0.01], ""], [38946, "2017-09-27T00:58:57Z", [0.0], ""], [38505, "2017-09-26T21:01:08Z", [0.0], ""], [32122, "2017-09-26T18:28:56Z", [0.02], "We are very nearly out of time for this question.

However, the timing continues to be up in the air given the current uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration, specifically with respect to the DOJ (Department of Justice). Further, the management highlighted that AT&T\u2019s merger integration team was nearly complete and was already looking at opportunities to improve advertising, bundling, and customer choice.\n. . . \n\"Despite the AT&T-Time Warner merger review being wrapped in uncertainty, AT&T (T) is moving forward with the groundwork for a new corporate structure made up of Time Warner\u2019s (TWX) assets. AT&T is planning to run a dual organization structure following the closure of the proposed acquisition of Time Warner. Randall Stephenson will remain as the overall head of the combined company, but media and telecom operations will be separated into two distinct divisions led by two chief executives. \"John Stankey, formerly the CEO (chief executive officer) of the Entertainment Group, will become the CEO of AT&T Media, which will include Time Warner\u2019s assets such as HBO, Warner Bros, and Turner Cable, which runs CNN. John Donovan, who was formerly the chief strategy officer, will head AT&T Communications after the merger.

AT&T hopes that Time Warner\u2019s media assets can help it overcome wireless competition driven by Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Sprint (S).\n. . . \n\"But the already prolonged review of the AT&T-Time Warner merger could take even more time to complete, given President Trump\u2019s vocal opposition to the deal as well as divisive issues and the leadership vacuum in the US Department of Justice. The size of the deal  [$85.4b] is also a factor, as it usually takes longer to complete the review of mega deals.  \"More specifically, the US Senate has yet to approve the nomination of a top DOJ official in charge of antitrust cases. This official has the last word as to whether a deal goes through or flops. . . .  delays in the approval of Delrahim\u2019s nomination will mean a longer wait for AT&T and Time Warner to know the fate of their deal. \"Media reports have recently emerged that the White House was trying to interfere with the merger of AT&T and Time Warner by using its influence to criticize and challenge CNN\u2019s coverage of the Trump administration. (CNN is owned by Time Warner.) Trump has shown open disdain for CNN, often referring to the long-established news outlet and media mainstay as \u201cfake news.\u201d  Notably, some lawmakers in Washington are concerned about Trump using the merger review as a bargaining chip to blunt media criticism of his administration. Sprint Brings More Attention to the AT&T-Time Warner Deal\n\" . . . recent media reports about Sprint (S) aggressively seeking a deal with a fellow wireless provider like T-Mobile (TMUS) or a cable company like Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR) have brought more attention to the potential implications of the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \"There are, of course, fears that AT&T could raise content costs for other media companies after its swallows Time Warner. Dish Network (DISH) acquires content from Time Warner, and AT&T\u2019s recent acquisition of DIRECTV and its subsequent launch of DIRECTV Now has brought it into more direct competition with Dish. In addition to offering satellite pay-TV, Dish runs a DIRECTV Now competitor, Sling TV. \"There are also concerns that AT&T could make life harder for its smaller competitors by only promoting its own products, which would make it difficult for its rivals to pitch to its phone subscribers. \"In what appears to complicate matters, AT&T has zero-rated DIRECTV Now so that it doesn\u2019t account against the data plans of its phone customers. The company also offers free access to HBO to subscribers of its unlimited data plans. HBO, a product of Time Warner, normally costs $15 a month. \"Now that Sprint is also on an expedition that could result in further wireless consolidation, there\u2019s been renewed attention on how the AT&T-Time Warner merger could impact consumer choices and prices. The Truth about AT&T-Time Warner: Limited Room for the DOJ to Say No\n\". . .  A section of lawmakers in Washington and some industry players have expressed reservations about merging AT&T, a wireless giant, and Time Warner, a media and entertainment behemoth. Calls to deny the merger have largely centered on worries that it could reduce competition and harm consumers. Others have cited reduced choices for consumers and higher service prices as possible results if AT&T is allowed to swallow Time Warner after taking over DIRECTV. \"Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike have either called for the denial of the AT&T-Time Warner deal or for stronger scrutiny of the deal. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump spoke against the idea of combining the two companies, suggesting it would result in an extremely powerful entity. \"Despite the opposition, the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the deal, seems to have limited room to deny AT&T-Time Warner merger outright. For example, the operations of AT&T and Time Warner have little overlap, if any. As such, the argument that combining them would harm the competition looks feeble. At the same time, Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2013 set a precedent that supports the course for combining AT&T and Time Warner. \". . .  AT&T wants to acquire Time Warner (TWX) as it believes buying this asset will dramatically transform its fortunes in a favorable way. Without a doubt, for rivals Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Comcast (CMCSA), a merger of AT&T and Time Warner has all the trappings of a nightmare. \"Despite what critics have been saying about AT&T-Time Warner merger, AT&T believes that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it gets what it wants. The company expects regulators to have completed the review of the merger proposal by the end of the year. \"Still, it\u2019s been about eight months since regulators started looking into the deal. AT&T has reportedly spent millions of dollars in Washington lobbying for the merger. \"Meanwhile, AT&T says that it doesn\u2019t intend to bully competitors by restricting their access to Time Warner content. Several television networks rely on Time Warner for shows, and AT&T has its own pay-TV service that would put it in competition with some of Time Warner\u2019s corporate customers. . . . AT&T chief Randall Stephenson stated the following in May: \u201cYou can\u2019t think about taking \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 and you\u2019re only going to make it available to AT&T customers. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d \"As much as the AT&T-Time Warner merger review is still shrouded in uncertainties, AT&T (T) is going ahead with preparations for a new corporate structure made up of Time Warner\u2019s (TWX) assets. \" . . . Such a corporate structure would suggest that AT&T wants to give its news media operations the autonomy it would need to stay independent. But some critics have expressed fears that AT&T could try to exert editorial influence on CNN once it comes under its control. Notably, CNN has a rocky relationship with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the long-established news outlet and media source as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n. . . \t\n\"Although some media and telecom companies have voiced their opposition to AT&T (T) merging with Time Warner (TWX), they might do best to be careful with what they say to regulators to back their claims\u2014it could make things difficult in the future. . . . If AT&T peers are contemplating mergers of their own, they\u2019ll likely careful what they say, lest they endanger their own future consolidation deals.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I don't know what to think.

I think this means the deal is approved before October but not much before.\nhttp://fortune.com/2015/06/08/merger-approvals/\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-01-06/at-t-doj-requested-in-depth-time-warner-review If trump speaks about this deal at some point before October that may also drastically shift the direction of the review."], [691, "2017-03-28T13:41:32Z", [0.8], ""], [23355, "2017-03-28T10:19:45Z", [0.65], ""], [34574, "2017-03-28T08:56:36Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-03-28T00:51:39Z", [0.95], ""], [28091, "2017-03-27T23:30:06Z", [0.93], ""], [34568, "2017-03-27T23:05:29Z", [0.79], ""], [30737, "2017-03-27T19:46:53Z", [0.85], "This large deal will spurn other M & A activity and distract from less favourable policieis"], [34557, "2017-03-27T19:40:41Z", [0.0], ""], [31274, "2017-03-27T19:10:41Z", [0.0], ""], [34552, "2017-03-27T18:11:53Z", [0.7], ""], [691, "2017-03-27T15:52:34Z", [0.79], ""], [34549, "2017-03-27T11:36:34Z", [1.0], ""], [34550, "2017-03-27T11:33:22Z", [0.75], ""], [34546, "2017-03-27T10:54:22Z", [0.7], ""], [34543, "2017-03-27T03:39:13Z", [0.99], ""], [6303, "2017-03-27T03:31:38Z", [0.95], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [98, "2017-03-26T23:48:55Z", [0.95], ""], [30517, "2017-03-26T22:52:47Z", [0.88], ""], [368, "2017-03-26T19:45:15Z", [0.95], ""], [24828, "2017-03-26T19:44:28Z", [0.7], ""], [28091, "2017-03-26T18:24:13Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2017-03-26T15:14:26Z", [0.78], ""], [34441, "2017-03-26T10:38:21Z", [0.99], ""], [34527, "2017-03-25T21:28:27Z", [0.75], ""], [368, "2017-03-25T20:23:45Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-03-25T19:08:39Z", [0.78], ""], [34444, "2017-03-25T15:27:56Z", [0.85], "Business wins in the Trump world"], [691, "2017-03-24T20:31:30Z", [0.78], ""], [34310, "2017-03-24T19:55:09Z", [0.2], ""], [34515, "2017-03-24T18:24:21Z", [0.42], ""], [34293, "2017-03-24T18:07:16Z", [0.99], ""], [368, "2017-03-24T18:05:33Z", [0.95], ""], [16649, "2017-03-24T10:40:38Z", [0.89], ""], [29680, "2017-03-24T04:20:40Z", [0.65], ""], [368, "2017-03-23T15:33:29Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-03-23T15:17:49Z", [0.78], ""], [331, "2017-03-23T13:25:10Z", [0.67], ""], [4634, "2017-03-23T05:58:04Z", [0.78], ""], [19801, "2017-03-23T04:47:05Z", [1.0], "Makan Delrahim, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer now working at the White House, told Canadian business news channel BNN last year that the Time Warner deal doesn\u2019t raise the same hurdles as a merger of two direct competitors, because it would unite a distributor and a content provider. \"Just the sheer size of it and the fact that it\u2019s media, I think will get a lot of attention,\" he said in the October 24 interview . \"However, I don\u2019t see this as a major antitrust problem.\" Those remarks set up a potential clash with an administration that has prized loyalty to its agenda.

But while the proposed $85 billion merger is likely to face an antitrust review by the Justice Department, there is still some question of whether AT&T and Time Warner will have to contend with the FCC\u2019s public-interest review. The FCC\u2019s new chairman, Ajit Pai, has told The Wall Street Journal that, since the companies put together the deal so that no FCC licenses need to be transferred, the FCC won\u2019t be involved.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai had told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that he did not foresee a role for the FCC on the takeover and his comments were confirmed to Reuters by FCC spokesman Neil Grace. Last Thursday, Time Warner said it plans to sell a broadcast station in Atlanta to Meredith Corp for $70 million, which could help speed the company's planned merger with AT&T. Pai declined to say on Thursday if he would use that transfer to try to review the broader merger. In January, AT&T said it expected to be able to bypass the FCC because it would not seek to transfer any Time Warner licenses. About a dozen U.S. senators have urged him to review the deal. The station that Time Warner is selling, WPCH-TV in Atlanta, is its only FCC-regulated broadcast station. It has other, more minor FCC licenses. Meredith has operated WPCH-TV for Time Warner since 2011. It was previously know as WTBS. Time Warner said last month it expected it would only need the consent of the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department, which is reviewing documents submitted on the proposed merger, has to prove a proposed deal harms competition in order to block it. The FCC has broad leeway to block a merger it deems is not in the \"public interest\" and can impose additional conditions.

Sen. Sessions will probably be confirmed as Attorney General despite the negative attention brought to his character by the Republican Senate's formal silencing of Sen. Warren. If DeVos could be confirmed, there's almost no way Sessions won't, as a more senior member of the Senate. Looking at precedent, Sessions will have to follow orders from Trump, or risk being fired as Sally Yates did, so if he's ordered to interfere with the merger, the Department Of Justice will likely attempt to block the merger. The chaos and confusion that resulted from some of Trump's executive orders has partially been due to lack of experience, judgement, and a strange retributive desire to shock and awe; But when Secretary of State Tillerson was confirmed, some order and clarity was restored, indicating that another factor has been a lack of direction, leadership and expertise. Just as Tillerson appears to have salvaged the Department of State, it's possible that Sessions' influence could moderate Trump's unchecked desire to ruin CNN (subsidiary of Time Warner), especially if someone sweetens the deal for the administration or member thereof. But it gets slightly more complicated because Republicans tend to be more relaxed with mergers than Democrats, so the only opposition would be by Republicans, and we haven't seen anyone but McCain and Rand Paul oppose Trump's policies, and only in certain instances. Based on those considerations, I think AT&T and Time-Warner will be subject to bullying, and the merger may be not be submitted or may be withdrawn if it seems to be a legal battle they do not want to pursue.  http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/01/10/will-sen-jeff-sessions-break-from-trump-pack-on-at-t-time-warner-85b-deal.html\n"], [33174, "2017-02-08T07:16:27Z", [0.65], ""], [5018, "2017-02-08T07:00:35Z", [0.2], ""], [4634, "2017-02-08T04:57:43Z", [0.65], ""], [32957, "2017-02-08T03:25:14Z", [0.8], ""], [31485, "2017-02-08T03:07:02Z", [0.85], ""], [33516, "2017-02-08T02:26:19Z", [0.8], ""], [30652, "2017-02-08T01:24:33Z", [0.68], ""], [33514, "2017-02-07T23:48:39Z", [0.25], "Trump Administration meddles in the deal or with one of the companies.
