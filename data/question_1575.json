My guess is that this figure is likely to either stay steady or increase given Australia's low case numbers [2] and the fact that most international flights for the rest of the year have been cancelled (so Australians are likely to vacation/travel more within the country via domestic flights) [3]. This implies that there will be at least 1,664,000 passengers (64,000 passengers last week * 26 weeks) \u2014 which is still an order of magnitude below 16 million!

So even if we were to assume that there will be no international travel in the second half of the year (which will not be the case \u2014 there will be some!) we could still have ~19 million domestic passengers.  Will this 2019 figure of ~19 million domestic passengers in the second half of 2019 be higher or lower in the second half of 2020? I can see two arguments that push in opposite directions. One is that people seem to be generally less inclined to fly [3], though I can't find any polling of Australians. The other is that Australians may increase their domestic travel so they can vacation in other parts of the country instead of abroad. Pending more information, I'll assume these two effects somewhat cancel out but I will give more weight to a general hesitancy to fly.

The year-on-year domestic drop for March was 39% per Australia's stats [1]. Using half the 2018 number from @Elizabeth-Wahlenmayer as a starting point [2], that starts with 27.5 million for half the year. Split that by month gives 4.6 million per month. The numbers for March, assuming grounded international flights and passenger numbers with a 39% drop gives an estimate of 1.1 million carried in March. I'll guess that rises by 10% per month, topping out at 1.84 which is my approximate domestic carrying by Qantas in a normal month. A normal month would have about 2.8 million international travelers. I'll start at 5% of that in July, as everyone is going to be nervous and it will take a while to figure things out as they reopen, then grow by 10% per month after. \tDomestic\tInternational \tTotal\nJuly\t 1.61         \t0.14                \t1.75\nAug\t 1.77\t        0.15\t                1.92\nSept 1.84\t        0.17\t                2.01\nOct\t1.84\t        0.19\t                2.03\nNov\t1.84\t        0.20                \t2.04\nDec\t1.84\t        0.23                 \t2.07\n\t\t\t                          Total: 11.82 I did some experiments with this model and unless the international starts off at 25% percent or higher OR has a higher growth rate than 10%, this sticks well below 16 million.

This would suggest that the international border is not likely to open anytime soon.\nBut there is much talk of the economic need for tourism and international students, which would apply pressure to open the border sooner rather than later. \nIt seems logical the government will opt for a staged re-opening of the border through the second half of 2020, after July. This leaves a maximum of 5 months, which at H2 2020 rates would equate to 24m passengers.\nHowever, it is also likely that a significant proportion of cancelled H1 trips (business and tourism) may be taken in the second half of the year.\nWith all these considerations in mind, the likely figure will almost certainly be less than 24m. The question is: by how much? And the will depend most heavily on the government's schedule for re-opening the border.\nGiven that the biggest factor influencing that decision is the progress of COVID worldwide, and that that doesn't look like slowing down anytime soon, I have wagered that the border will be opened slowly and selectively, which favours the lower figure.

Qantas Airways Limited has demonstrated growth in passengers carried, seats available, and revenue from 2014 to 2019. This includes carrying 48,776,000 passengers in 2014; 52,681,000 in 2016; and 55,273,000 in 2018 according to tables in the 2018 Annual Report.\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic has halted significant portions of air travel. Two trends used to forecast the impact this will have on the total passengers carried in the second half of the year include Australia's recovery from COVID-19 and Qantas' domestic flights. \nApproximately four months passed in China from the first cases until a day without new cases and it continues to see less than 100 to 200 new cases per day. Like other countries, China has restricted international travel. As a result it is likely that Australia will see major recovery by July, although international travel limits may remain in place.  \nQantas has suspended nearly all international flights and cut domestic capacity by 60% to deal with the current drop in demand for flights. On the other hand, Qantas is financially stable, has a broad domestic network, and expects to see pent up demand after COVID-19. Domestic flights alone may bring Qantas 12 to 13 million passengers at 80% of domestic capacity because Qantas carried over 32 million passengers on domestic flights in 2019.  Domestic travel may sustain passenger numbers from prior years if a COVID-19 recovery is seen early in June and July. Total passengers carried in the second half of the year is most likely to fall under 20 million, because international travel will remain limited and makes up approximately a third of Qantas' flights.   https://investor.qantas.com/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/doLLG5ufYkCyEPjF1tpgyw/file/data-book/2019qantasdatabook.pdf\nhttps://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/qantas-cuts-deep-but-well-placed-to-weather-covid-19-518552"], [87155, "2020-04-27T23:28:46Z", [0.44, 0.35, 0.2, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [87980, "2020-04-27T16:19:42Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Australia inbound tourists less likely to be impacted on numbers than other markets, as it's a long haul destination where 2 week isolation in good weather and low population density might seem more rational than other locations, if the govt allows it!

Qantas displayed 2 solid years, without much change, and there is not much reason for crazy change in the supply of Qantas. The government provided a solid package of about $A 1 billion to airlines, which focused on the big airlines such as Qantas and therefore I feel that despite the cuts and change to operations they had to make, the airline will not be significantly weakened in the short run.\nNow for the demand side. Most articles I have read have given a timeline of roughly 4-7 months for demand to increase again. This is much more global and severe than SARS which took a bit less time than this for demand of tourism to recover in Asia. An important factor is that Qantas is focused on international air, which means that it will be badly hit in demand. However, its data books show that roughly 40% of its flights are to and from Asia, which has recovered much more quickly and effectively from the virus. This suggests that this portion of passengers will not change much. However for its flights elsewhere, it will take a siginficant amount of time for demand to recover.\n"], [59042, "2020-03-30T10:29:53Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.08, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-03-30T09:49:26Z", [0.6, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-03-30T09:48:56Z", [0.55, 0.25, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [20558, "2020-03-30T07:16:47Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [20558, "2020-03-30T07:09:12Z", [0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [40854, "2020-03-30T06:40:10Z", [0.3, 0.55, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [40854, "2020-03-30T06:38:12Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.55, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [45217, "2020-03-30T01:51:31Z", [0.35, 0.5, 0.12, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [20347, "2020-03-30T00:44:55Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13055, "2020-03-29T21:00:57Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86809, "2020-03-29T18:31:34Z", [0.65, 0.3, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [86729, "2020-03-29T16:25:12Z", [0.02, 0.54, 0.34, 0.1, 0.0], "P. 102 & 103 of my notebook"], [84533, "2020-03-29T16:03:30Z", [0.5, 0.48, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "When will the pandemic peak?

This includes carrying 48,776,000 passengers in 2014; 52,681,000 in 2016; and 55,273,000 in 2018 according to tables in the 2018 Annual Report.  In consideration of the impact of coronavirus, I examined the John Hopkins map tracking confirmed cases as well as news articles. Approximately four months passed in China from the first cases until a day without new cases. Like other countries, China has also closed its borders to the majority of foreigners.  From these two trends, I believe that Australia's recovery will begin by July, though international air travel may remain limited. If full recovery was achieved, more than 28 million passengers would likely be carried based on Qantas' growth. However, due to border restrictions, a moderate recovery is more likely.  https://investor.qantas.com/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/doLLG5ufYkCyEPjF1tpgyw/file/annual-reports/2018-Annual-Report-ASX.pdf\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/\nhttps://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"], [40584, "2020-03-27T23:51:12Z", [0.33, 0.38, 0.26, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [40584, "2020-03-27T23:40:57Z", [0.3, 0.35, 0.25, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [79464, "2020-03-27T23:29:47Z", [0.33, 0.27, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [78823, "2020-03-27T22:50:57Z", [0.0, 0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2020-03-27T21:59:18Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "All major events cancelled, economy down, most people don\u2019t want/aren\u2019t allowed/can\u2019t travel for some time.
