It seems that this is largely a technical limitation. They don't want to do commercial service until the service is reliable (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/spacex-to-keep-starlink-pricing-simple-exit-beta-when-network-is-reliable/), they say they \"still have a lot of work to do\" on reliability, and the SEC filing bases their prediction on their \"current launch cadence\" for putting satellites in orbit. The \"end of 2020\" service is for the northern US/southern Canada, the area that they're testing the beta in most heavily and for the longest time, so it's unlikely they'd start somewhere else. \"Before the end of 2020\" for a Musk project facing what they describe as technical limitations is rough, it's hard to get less optimistic than that. If the commercial service start date is gated by their schedule of rocket launches, then there's no chance that that would accelerate to before June from \"end of 2020\" with Musk's signature delays.  I reserve some probability for it though. It's possible they'll do commercial service in a really small area by late June to see how it looks, even though that sounds like exactly what a beta is. It's also possible they'll set up some special commercial contract with a specific group. They've done pilots with the Air Force and with rural school districts to provide them service, but thus far they've lumped them under the beta umbrella. There's a chance they stop doing that and classify some specific project as commercial service, but that's not really something I'd bank too much on.

Google Fiber's trusted tester program may be closer, where programs range from 1-4 months. 2 gig Google Fiber was announced for testing in mid-September last year and made available early February this year, so 4.5 months there. The Starlink beta has been running in beta since early August 2020 (7.5 months running) and in public beta since late October/early November 2020 (4.5 months running), with a larger open beta starting late January (2 months running). I\u2019ll need to reevaluate at the end of April, since that seems like the most likely timing for an announcement given past updates.  Pro case: Preorders for the non-beta product list a low-end ETA of mid-late 2021 for some areas of the US for the delivery. The service was originally intended to be commercially available at the beginning of this year but instead they expanded the beta, so Q2 would already include a delay as we should expect. For areas with mid-late 2021 ETA they may be deciding which areas to start offering commercial service in first, meaning some will get mid-2021 and others late-2021, but any commercial service means the question is a yes regardless of where they choose. The beta results have been very promising with very impressive speeds being delivered, meaning they likely have capacity to add a good volume of new customers, and the rollout timing should be on the lower (more optimistic) end of the spectrum since there haven\u2019t been obvious hiccups. The price point may have delayed the rollout, but it may be worth opening up a commercial service, even if on a small scale, at the current price given the huge volume of preorders. Musk said they\u2019d need about 800 satellites for moderate coverage of the US and they\u2019re at over 1,000, so given that and the download speeds people are seeing in beta, commercial service is probably viable from a bandwidth perspective. They also mentioned wanting the ETC designation by the FCC by June 7 2021 to get their RDOF funding, and there\u2019s a chance that that\u2019ll push them to have a commercial product in the near future.  Con case: The constellation is <10% completed for the initial 12,000 satellites. The goal per Musk is global coverage by the end of the year, and after that about densifying coverage, which sounds like expanding the beta worldwide with limited capacity, and then densifying coverage to make a commercial product realistic. Their latest move was to expand the beta to more latitudes as more satellites were added in those ranges, so keeping capacity limited while the constellation is small and expanding the beta across more land areas as satellites are added at different locations would make sense and follow a past pattern. Musk also sucks with deadlines so betting on a delay is never unreasonable. They may also be waiting to release a commercial product until they can get the at-home kit to a more reasonable price point, which per their Reddit posts has been their single hardest challenge. There\u2019s no realistic competition in this space (heh) so there may be less of a rush than other product betas like Google Fiber."], [586, "2021-03-22T10:44:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "Again pushing April-June scenario. We need to take into consideration that the whole project pace will accelerate over time.

With summer coming up, it is reasonable that some of the launches out of Florida may be delayed because of thunderstorms that occur during that time of year. As a proxy, Tesla's auto-pilot system is still in beta mode after 4 months to date, so we can expect longer for space services. Reason to believe they can get it done because 1) they have a plan and 2) they have FCC approval. A reason to doubt is that Elon Musk himself said Starlink is not really purposed for areas like San Francisco or New York, where there is ample connection. Nonetheless, there are pre-orders already in place in USA. Beta has been going on since late October 2020, it seems. PS: Not before 1 July 2021 contains more days of the year (infinitely greater than the other choices combined), so our best bet without any knowledge would be to choose the last one. It is also consistent with the planning fallacy and Musk's tendency to underestimate the time it takes to complete his own projects.

America.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/spacex-expands-starlink-public-beta-test-to-canada-united-kingdom.html 2) They recently opened pre-orders in areas of US, claiming a \"mid to late 2021\" timeframe for some states and a 2022 timeframe for others. The fact that some areas are listed as 2022 suggests that the \"mid to late 2021\" will actually skew late 2021. However, it only needs to be commercially available in ONE area before then for the outcome to be satisfied.\nhttps://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/spacex-starlink-now-taking-pre-orders-for-service-in-mid-to-late-2021/ 3) On Feb 9th, Musk posted two tweets: \n\"SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.\"\n...\n\"Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO\"\nThis suggests that cash flow is a relatively big concern for Starlink - hence why they've opened up pre-orders. This suggests to me that Starlink will be incentivised to begin commercial services ASAP. However, they'll also want to balance this with long-term success \nhttps://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-preorders-121427490.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGz2ggUjyPug1o1Op-32ZrV5Bgc3tCeF8Yej2EMmHKvRzbBTfnXdRf50QC7Mf79db5B28gfDnIm5mBCRVagsRO1atwUSaxlc6RG425hkmgOUiOyIG1Pg9715W7SO6mWXjyFPycxxEXuFehzaGh5aorTUmrW3I0mUubNtHwPvlx5e 4) There are approx 1,000 satellites in orbit right now (1145 according to Wikipedia). Each upcoming launch will deploy ~60 additional satellites. There have been 4 launches since beginning of year & looking at upcoming schedule, it appears to remain at about 1 launch every 2 weeks for foreseeable future (+120 satellites / month).\nBy 31st March: ~1265\nBy 30th April: ~1385\nBy 31st May: ~1505\nBy 30th June: ~1725\nUnsure number of satellites that would be needed for launch of commercial services but the relative increase in the number of satellites that will be in orbit between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021 versus number that are in orbit now is substantial.

But there is a chance of a short public beta that goes well and then they do a limited commercial opening in North America. So I'm leaning toward not until July, but could potentially be earlier than that.

However, that rate has increased dramatically with 13 successful launches in 2020 as of August 18 - which is another reason averages are deceiving....  there are 5 additional Starlink launches scheduled for 2020. [1] SpaceX has conducted 11 successful Starlink launches as of August 18, placing a total of 595 satelites into LEO [2] Starlink can reach Canada and the northern United States with 12 launches, and there are 3 more Starlink launches scheduled for September, 2020. [1] Starlink can reach nearly all the populated world after 24 successful launches. [2] Beta Testing is underway, so the question in my mind is \"who is the target audience for this service?\" It appears that the obvious clients are people who currently do not have access to a broadband connection. Only 6% of the U.S. population lack broadband, so it seems unlikely that Starlink will open commercial service after 12 launches - although, 6% is 19 million potential customers (but not really, more on that below)...... [3] The Beta Test appears to be scheduled for 8 weeks. Having started end of July - beginning of August, that brings it to completion by the end of September or beginning of October. [4] Starlink will have conduct 14 launches by then, so theoretically they will be able to service all of North America and Canada by then. They'll likely take at least a month following the Beta Test to process the data and make tweaks. There are two Starlink launches left in 2020 at this point, one in November, and one December 1st.[1] Given Elon Musk's habit of launching his products in North America and Canada first before expanding globally, it would make sense to appeal. 6% of Canadians lack internet, which amounts to about 2.25 million potential customers. 19 million potential U.S. customers does not equal U.S. households..... according to the 2010 census [5], 76% of Americans were 18 years or older (21.25 x .76 = 16.15).  48.2% of Americans are married ((16.15 x .482)/2)+(16.15 x .518) = 12.25785 million U.S. potential households - not accounting for people who have roommates and share an internet account. Meanwhile, in Canada, there are 1.8594 million Canadians who are over 18 and lack internet. 56% are married, so ((1.8594 x .56)/2) + (1.8594 x .44) = 1.338768 million potential Canadian households. 12.25785 million + 1.338768 million = 13.596618 million potential customers. Each Falcon Heavy 9 rocket costs about $57 million to launch [6], so after the minimum 12 launches SpaceX will have spent upwards of $684 million on the hopes of servicing only 13.596618 million customers. This ignores the fact that SpaceX launches other company's satellites into orbit for a profit, so they've been making money.... Starlink will offer speeds up to 1GB, which right now costs between $80 - $100 in America. Lets say that they want to undercut the competition and offer it for $50 a month. $50 x 13.596618 = $680 million per month. This assumes a lot, including that all who lack internet will sign up for Starlink. About 10% of Americans don't use internet [7], so $50 x (13.596618 x .9) = $611.8 million per month. For those that don't have internet currently, how likely are they to hear about Starlink so that they sign up? Will Elon have to advertise on radio, TV, or in the paper? Tesla famously relies on earned media, social media, and word of mouth. I'm not sure if that's sufficient for this product. The point is, while I think that its financially viable - desirable, in fact - to launch this service in North America as soon as possible after the Beta Test, I think it will take some time to create awareness. So, I'm leaning away from a 2020 commercial launch.

I'm not extremely bullish on this taking place this year for a few reasons. 1. Elon's companies tend to declare very aggressive timelines that are extremely hard to hit in practice. This is great for goal setting, but sets me to think prediction wise that things will happen behind that aggressive schedule.\n2. As many have posted, there have been some leaked testing results. You could probably go two ways on those: the results are far below what was promised meaning they'll want to hold off from a reputation standpoint, OR those results are on par or better than what people get in rural US today, meaning they might be desirable and could start generating revenue for SpaceX. With those points, I'll tend to push latter. I think they could start earlier and be aggressive, but they'll also want to make a splash once they start. And consumer industries are extremely fickle, you don't want to launch a product and create a bad brand reputation. Something they've worked very hard to avoid with Tesla.
