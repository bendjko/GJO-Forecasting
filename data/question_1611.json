Two questions remain: Will the backlogged cases be reported in one daycount, or resolved step by step?

Of these 11 states,  CA, DC, FL, ME, WA are currently on a path towards the OUT-group (even if all of them materialize as \"NO\" together with the SAFE group, the question could still resolve on bin 7 with 45 states, however, due to recent trend switching to the IN-group cannot be excluded yet)\nCT, LA, SC and maybe NC currently belong to the IN-group, but have a \"special\" unreliable pattern in testing, and could switch to the OUT-group easily because of reporting one up to three zero testing/cases days in the remaining time frame (especially CT could change on the very last day, if there are one or two zero days on 29/30 September) or because the amount of testing is drastically below average recently, and one has to see, whether this continues (LA, SC)  \nNV, NY are currently on an almost neutral path without a clear trend, and one or two days with lower/higher than average new cases could switch them to either the OUT-group or to the IN-group respectively\nall of the 10 states + DC require further observation and remodeling on 25 September. However, this is my latest tentative schedule for the rest of the month:\nAL 22 September 2020 #33\nOR 22 September 2020\nUT 22 September 2020\nMS 24 September 2020 #36\nTX\nMD 26 September 2020 #38\nNJ 29 September 2020 #39\nNY\nNC\nSC\nCT 30 September 2020\nLA\nME\nNV\nWA # 43 - 47 Unfortunately, it looks like there are five states that will not be determined before 30 September, but are likely to me to show a significant up-trend before 25 September 2020, so they will be included in the IN-group in the end; four more states are more certain, will not be determined before 29 September 2020 and could be by some event switch to the OUT-group as well.\nThis leaves a larger bandwidth than before, of 38 to 47 states, mainly because testing and thus new cases have not been consistent in the past four days, but I choose to remain attached rather to the upper limit. Additionally,  there are two states + DC which I refrained from scheduling, since CA and FL in the past showed a similar pattern to what Texas experienced, and Texas had an outlier peak recently almost 10,000 cases (9,853 to be precise) in one day (21 September2020), according to\nhttps://covidtracking.com/data/state/texas\n, which totally changes any calculus. Since CA used to be very consistent in testing and more rigorous in enforcing hygiene, it is the most likely to avoid such an unusual (reporting) peak in the remaining time frame, it could happen, however. Florida has seen a decrease in testing and reporting cases, which is probably the aftermath of two storms making landfall in just one week, so it is highly likely to me there will be some sort of catch-up in confirmation of cases, once the troubled areas and the scene have been cleared and cleaned.\nDC is short of only 117 cases according to my latest projection, which corresponds to around two day's values of reporting. However, my gut says to me there's something wrong with this, and DC will likely have the same fate as ME, which I expect to see significant growth on average to outnumber the June cases finally. By the way, on the website\nhttps://www.covidexitstrategy.org/\nthere are only 12 states which do not fall into the categories \"Uncontrolled spread\" or \"Trending poorly\"; if you'd subtract Hawaii and Michigan, which already have surpassed their June case numbers, and assume that the relevant territories would be \"Trending poorly\" or worse, if they were included, that is another indication for 45 states and territories (or more) and bin 7 as the final resolution of this question. Later today, I am going to look at the individual about 14 states that are \"closest to call\" and hope to find a clue what direction they are heading in, I will post this as an EDIT.

After determining each state\u2019s \u201cSept Max\u201d (i.e. its June figure) for it to not exceed June\u2019s, I was able to quickly isolate those states which had already violated based on the latest Sept data. Hence 100% prob. for these. Num of previous months exceeded change:\nCompared the change from August to Sept Max against historical monthly changes since Feb. A tally of those previous months with greater change served as a discount. My rational is that whether on a downward or upward trend, history supports the possibility of achieving the Sept threshold (w/o necessarily surpassing it) despite the size of movement required.   Num of months where trend reversed:\nAssessed the direction of suggested change (August to Sept Max). Where it would reverse the trend - when measured against the monthly avg change since June - compared this against historical to tally those months which also had a reversal in month-to-month change. This tally would also serve as a discount because , similarly to above, evidences it as possible which could subsequently prevent September from exceeding. Estimated Sept final exceeds:\nLeveraging the obvious benefit of it now being September, calculated the daily rate and, after accounting for days remaining, estimated a final tally of cases for the month. Where this exceeded Sept Max, a credit towards the likelihood of actual exceeding was assigned.    For a given state, its final probability of exceeding its June figures took the net sum of tallies from above to deduct from the 100% assumption after dividing them by the number of months since Feb. Interpreting the percentages assigned to each state tally bucket as the likelihood of that bucket representing all states with higher Sept figures, I sorted the calculated state probabilities from highest to lowest to determine where to begin apportioning. For instance, if 29 states have assigned 100% probability, all buckets with a cut-off below 28 would be given 0 probability. The next qualifying bucket would contain a tally up to its cut-off that\u2019s weighted by the individual state probabilities. This would be repeated for each subsequent bucket until accounting for all 56 state-level probabilities. Lastly, each bucket total is displayed as a percentage of the sum to ensure a grand total of 100%.

I counted 15 states and territories which have accelerated significantly their case growth during 05 to 09 September 2020, 4 of which are now considered in a range of possibility to change outcome (to \"more in September than in June\"). At the same time, the acceleration is re-confirming the previously expected excess of cases in the other 11 states, which I will consider as a given from now on.\n4 other states confirmed their path towards a lower outcome (DC, ME, NM, VT) which I will also consider as a given.\nHowever, 3 states that I expected to be in the \"out-group\", failed my expectations and -at least preliminarily - switched to a path towards the \"in-group\": NJ, RI, WA.\nI have previously considered NY as safe below, but it's getting closer there, so NY replaces ME in my \"indiscriminate\" group under close scrutiny: CA, FL, NJ, MP, NJ, UT plus I add CT.\nAs of 09 September these seven stand as follows:\nCA: out (since trend is declining), \nCT: out (strong short-term upward trend, yet still below June value expected)\nFL: out (since trend is declining),\nNY: in (since decline may not be large enough or stop),\nMP: in (1 new case since last forecast, leads to 10 projected cases compared to 8 in June),\nNJ: in (currently strong acceleration in new cases, a significant slow down would be compulsory to switch to the out-group again),\nUT: currently \"in\" at an virtually unchanged rate but by a very slight margin; little changes in e.g. testing could tip it to any direction. As a result, in total, it's getting more complicated:\nThe group of 9 which seemed likely not to surpass their June case number (mainly New England states + D.C., NM, AZ) has shrunk to 5.\n3 states from the indiscriminate group included, there are 8 states with increased certainty to have lower case numbers for September than for June. 13 states already have surpassed their June value, some of which even earlier than projected.\n4 indiscriminate states are currently in the \"in-group\"\n11 states are currently on a stable path towards the \"in-group\"\n10 more states are currently on a path towards the \"in-group\" as well, but with lowered certainty\nThe remaining 9 states are likely in an unchanged position within the margin of error (I haven't identified them yet), where the majority will see slight increases and, as a result, the June number of cases will be surpassed between 20 to 30 September 2020 as of now. As of now 34-37 (40 minus 10 plus 4 plus the \"switching 3\") states in total seem to belong to the \"in-group\" at the lowest, while the range extended to up to 47.\nBut:\nIn an environment with a US nationwide decline of new cases and an \"deceleration/acceleration-ratio\" of 1.33 (20 states and territories versus 15 s.a.t. of significance), it just seems to me that the overall variance in new cases has increased and the US as a whole and maybe half of the individual states may be at a turning point at this point in time. It remains to be seen, whether this turning (for the better or for the worse) will be sustainable and soon enough to affect the September case counts. And then there is a lot of overall uncertainty about effects of increased mask-wearing habits (potentially decelerating), schools and university campuses (potentially accelerating) and the labor day holiday weekend (potentially accelerating).\nFor now, I comfortably leave my forecast unchanged with the highest weight on bin 6.\nMP and UT currently form an error band of (-2%/++2%) and are likely to continue to do so until MP has added 6 more cases and Utah starts showing any trend. Further data and analysis of the given data as of 09 September will follow in an [EDIT], when available. [EDIT:\nMy manual best guess-model, in which I also look at the historic graphs counts 10 states that are likely to deliver September figures lower than the June total. Most notably and unexpectedly NC and SC have seen such a large slump in case growth that I added them to the list. CT might be an 11th state, but it currently is directly on the brink. I also tried to formalize the estimate as of 09 September 2020 into a static, simplifying model as follows:\nThe model takes the period of 01 September to 09 September inclusively cutting it into two separate units, following my two most recent forecasts: \nA := number of total cases 01 to 05 September 2020 inclusively\nB := number of total cases 06 to 09 September 2020 inclusively Although there is no reliability concerning representativeness for B as part of the whole month September (henceforth referred to to as \"S\"), I simply project S(e)= A + 6.25* B\nunder the assumption that the next 21 days or 5.25 periods of B (=4 days) will each result on average the same amount as B, and the assumption that deviations from B in single periods will (more or less) cancel each other over 5,25 periods. This approach is rather aggressive in a way that it overweights the most recent development and will amplify good as well as bad developments to the extreme. The caveat with this approach is that it basically assumes a flat 7 day average after 04 September 2020, which does not fit reality for most individual states, and it does not take into account trends, which are very important in a handful of states.\nThe projection, although I take it as one of many pieces of evidence, delivers a few new insights. First, it also counts SC to the \"out-group\", but contrary to my opinion, NC is currently in the \"in-group\" according to the model.\nSecondly, it counts only 9 states in total (AZ, DC, FL, ME, MA, NH, NM, SC, VT) to be in the \"out-group\", which on the flipside means that the final result would be 46 states and territories, and the question would resolve on bin 7.\nFurther, I added the percentage values compared to the June 2020 total (referred to as \"J\") as follows:\n(1) A*6/J\n(2) B*7.5/J\n(3) (A+B)*30/9*J The result underscores the importance of the future trend (which is why I don't take the result too seriously):\nA few states started well below 100%, but will likely knock off the bar in the end:\nCT:\nA: 61.67%\n(A+B): 93.82%\nS(e): 116.76% (est.) RI:\nA: 91.73%\n(A+B): 144,39%\nS(e): 190.47%(est.) NJ:\nA: 95.54%\n(A+B): 102.60%\nS(e): 108.77%(est.) WA:\nA: 89.13%\n(A+B): 101.91%\nS(e): 113.09%(est.) NY:\nA: 106.22%\n(A+B): 105.14%\nS(e): 104.19% NC:\nA: 141.38%\n(A+B): 124.17%\nS(e): 109.12%(est.) SC:\nA: 129.52%\n(A+B): 103.24%\nS(e): 80.25%(est.) According to the model (and to my own basic thoughts), the rule seems to be, that all states and territories which are likely to stay below their June value, already on 5 September 2020 were under 100% of their proportionate time span.\nAnd all states and territories which started off with a value of less than 100% proportionately, indeed have a good chance of staying there after 9 days into September. The exceptions are (as shown above):\nSC in the first case, and \nCT, RI, NJ, WA in the latter case. In this model, CA appears to be the borderline case: CA:\nA: 117.58%\n(A+B): 109.41%\nS(e): 102.26%(est.), which is reasonably close, but still higher than June, which is contrary to my personal opinion. By a rule of thumb, one can say that the inertia in the virus spread is so important that no state will have a chance to achieve a lower number of new cases in September than in June, if its first five days, multiplied by 6, were about 114% of the complete June 2020 value (derived from CA; 108% for the first nine days) or higher AND it does not have a strong trend of reduction after nine days - at least that's what the simplified model predicts. ]"], [88766, "2020-09-11T08:03:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.51, 0.49, 0.0], ""], [13306, "2020-09-11T06:31:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.36, 0.04], ""], [14027, "2020-09-11T02:10:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.29], "Unless things go to hell in a hand basket (which could still happen), I count ten states that are very likely to fall into the \"NO\" category.

These states would probably have to go into strict lockdown to do so. That seems unlikely. And, anyway, it is probably already too late to influence this question. Finally, only nine of the fifty-five possibles report an incidence rate <1.0 (as of 9th Sept).\nhttps://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"], [95370, "2020-09-09T12:29:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.23, 0.69, 0.03], "Reading in updates as of yesterday and we see that 7 states are already above June's levels and there are some candidates that are expected to go up over June's levels in the upcoming days.

We note that more cases are a byproduct of either a higher spread of cases OR simply higher testing rates. Given this, it is unsurprising to expect for many states to have higher case counts in September than in June, since testing rates have increased.  In thinking about actual spread, it is not unreasonable to believe that infection rates may be relatively the same as in June in most parts of the US. However, September has some characteristics that may affect these rates. Firstly, universities are open in many states, and it would not be surprising to see these affect the overall case numbers. Second, September is when season starts to turn to winter. Although it is still unknown how this affects the virus, it may lead to more people interacting indoors and thus an increase in cases. Based on a basic linear interpolation using the first 8 days of September data, 39 states are on pace to have more cases now than in June. This is unsurprisingly higher than the August number, and likely takes into account some of the factors mentioned. I then use a very simplified model to come up with an distribution, assuming each state has probability 39/50=0.78 of being above its June number.

So far I will stick to the number of about 40 (+/-2) states and territories as the final result until otherwise proven, since mistakes in both directions are likely to cancel each other, and three states seem to be a sufficient buffer. \nCA, FL, UT and maybe even NJ seem to be trending negative at least, so the final result c.p. may be 42 states and territories on 01 October 2020.\n[EDIT: I corrected some of the formulations and some of the estimated dates (which appear later now) to the best of my knowledge, they will still remain estimates... the idea remains the same.]"], [13306, "2020-09-06T09:46:11Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.5, 0.05], ""], [88098, "2020-09-06T02:36:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.28, 0.6, 0.1], ""], [57778, "2020-09-06T02:02:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.2, 0.53, 0.26], ""], [57778, "2020-09-06T01:57:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.35, 0.53, 0.11], ""], [88569, "2020-09-06T00:34:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.44, 0.44, 0.03], ""], [95400, "2020-09-05T23:19:11Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.16, 0.29, 0.34, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [86554, "2020-09-05T22:58:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.42, 0.48, 0.0], ""], [90167, "2020-09-05T22:22:52Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.24, 0.4, 0.36, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2020-09-05T22:04:50Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.15, 0.05], ""], [56, "2020-09-05T21:49:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5], ""], [38094, "2020-09-05T20:50:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.0], "Hattip @dzhou3 for a balanced discussion of the topic based on a model.

We can do the following calculation fairly easily.  Yes, it's a bit tedious, but shouldn't take more than about half an hour.  Subtract the cumulative number of positive tests on May 31 from the cumulative number of positive tests on June 30.  It's the data column labeled \"cases.\"  Call the result J.  Divide the answer by 30 to get the average number of new cases for the month of June for each state. Now we can compare the daily positive tests for each state to that state's June average.  [Better still to use the current 7-day average of positive tests.]  At the present time there are only 10 states that are seeing average new cases below their respective June averages.  If nothing were to change the answer would be 55 - 10 = 45.  But of course things are changing every day. By my count there are 24 states that are so far above their June averages that it is a virtual certainty that S > J.  Reinfection rates would have to fall to something like 0.5 for new case numbers to decrease that drastically.  That seems unlikely.  [Alternatively we would have to stop testing.  This also seems unlikely.]  An additional 8 states are more likely than not to see S > J.  There are only three states that look very likely to see S <  J (AZ, FL & NH). Lastly, by my count there are about a dozen states that are too close to call.  These states could quickly flip either way, e.g., look at IA.  Over the past week the 7-day average has nearly doubled.  Prior to this past week it looked like IA could go either way.  Now it's a virtual certainty that S > J for IA. My conclusion is that it is much more likely that a state will see a rapid increase in new cases than a rapid decrease.  Based on the above I estimate that the answer will be 42 states.

See https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html The New York City study was widely reported in the media.  I was not aware of the other studies, but a Google search for \"covid antibody surveys\" quickly found the above link. The NYC study estimated that there were ten times as many people with antibodies as there were confirmed infections.  If that were true then states like AZ and LA would be approaching some limited amount of herd immunity.  There have been numerous articles about the possibility of herd immunity.  See for example https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/07/herd-immunity-coronavirus/614035/ I believe Louisiana has the highest number of confirmed cases as a percentage of the state's population (3.1%).  The serology study estimated about two times that percentage had antibodies (5.8%, with an error band of 3.9 to 8.2%).  So for LA the ratio of people with antibodies to confirmed cases was much less that the 10 to 1 ratio that got a lot of publicity after the NYC study.  The same appears to be true for the other locations, e.g., CT, that were included in the COVID antibody surveys.  The ratio appears to be closer to two to one, not 10 to one. I am now much less optimistic that any kind of herd immunity will slow the virus' spread.  The vaccine, if it works, is the only way to get to herd immunity in less than 3 years.  Bummer!

Glancing through the state daily new case curves, it seems like a state requires at least 1.5 months to complete a spike cycle. The states where case counts are decreasing have enough time to fall below June averages throughout September. In states where counts are increasing they will probably remain above June levels through September which gives us 5. For states where counts are about the same it's unclear whether cases will fall fast enough by then so I would estimate about half of the cases with above June levels will have more cases in September - 5.5. Still, because states appear unwilling to impose full lockdowns, it may take longer than before a for a case cycle to go through so I would adjust up slightly and add a few states in the decreasing category.

Per NYT coronavirus data, about 10 states in the western US (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas) are experiencing very few cases - and have not changed significantly since the onset of the virus in the US, thus making the 44< and 36-44 cases relatively unlikely. However, the resurgence of the virus in the southern states (specifically southeastern states) and a predicted upcoming outbreak in the midwest makes me believe that there is a high likelihood for at least half of the states to have more cases in September than in June (with a relatively small probability that fewer than 11 states have more cases in September)"], [14027, "2020-08-10T00:12:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.47, 0.41, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-08-09T23:40:27Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.14, 0.35, 0.44, 0.04], ""], [88569, "2020-08-09T22:53:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.2, 0.34, 0.33, 0.08], ""], [92822, "2020-08-09T22:03:18Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.09, 0.22, 0.37, 0.28], "This question is just so brutal because there are so many different factors to consider.

Better testing capabilities. Schools opening up across the country (Specifically in NYC, could be a disaster). Unequal circumstances make it so that NY could return to normal while other states are still clamped down \u2013 this would breed resentment, anger, and make people not care enough to enforce protocol \u2013 diversity of outcomes in this country makes difficult to have coherent national message.\nFactors against: June had protests, lockdown protests, prime summer months.

Most states we see cases pick up in June, and given we estimate it will be about 2-3 months before new cases per day decline. We should see new cases per day start to decline by August/September. Would have said September only, but given some states are not as dense as New York's corona hotpots, will allow for slightly less time. This leaves my fair at roughly half the states since September and June are both relatively the same distance from our estimated peak (1.5 months in). To account for the fact that most states that are witnessing surges in cases have constituents that refuse to wear masks/strongly do not want to follow government precautions, we can see how it could possible take longer than the 3 months it took NY to see daily new cases fall.

And the president has stated that we should be testing less, because \"more testing makes us look bad.\"  This is not a recipe for reduced infection numbers. There is another question regarding the number of states with a reinfection number, Rt, greater than 1.0.  See https://rt.live.  As of 7/25 the highest Rt is 1.23, for Rhode Island; the lowest Rt is 0.84, for Maine.  Also as of 7/25, 21 states are clustered between 0.96 and 1.04.

Five states and territories (GU, MP, NY, SD, and VT) are very close to their respective June averages.  That leaves 44 states and territories that are above their June averages, and most of those are significantly above the June numbers.

Based on the NYTimes state-level maps, 43 states are currently seeing daily new cases on the rise. For almost all of these states, daily new cases are above levels seen in June because the end of May was the trough of the 'first wave' before reopening in most of those states. Next, we should check what the lifecycle of a case resurgence looks like. Based on the initial wave of cases in the states with the most serious outbreaks (NY, CT, NJ, DC etc.) a cycle takes above 2-3 months to run its course with a reasonable amount of variance. Thus, we can expect states that started to resurge in mid-June as reopening commenced to be at the tail end of their cycles. This would cause us to move our estimate downwards from the baseline of low-40's. But two important context specific factors bake me keep my distribution centered fairly high in the upper 30's. First, though some states like California have been willing to reinstitute lockdown policies due to the second wave, most other state governors have not been willing to do so. Still, even if lockdown-esque policies are put in place, rates of testing are much higher so even if test-positivity rates are lower, the raw number of cases will be higher than before simply because we are catching more cases. The policy variable does add the most uncertainty to my estimate though which is why I put decent probability on all outcomes from 12-35 states below my max of 36-43. State governors are increasingly encouraging the use of masks and mask usage in the US is on the rise. It is possible that as masks become more widespread, we reach a point at which we see substantial reductions in new cases without states having to go into full lockdowns. This variable is uncertain both from a policy perspective, a cultural perspective, and a public health efficacy perspective.

My analysis refers to data which involves only the 50 US States + DC. I will therefore scale up my final numbers by 55/51 for my final result. The most important nuance to this question is that the number of infected individuals currently far exceeds the number of reported cases because of low gross testing rates. Higher rates of testing will reveal more cases, especially once more asymptotic cases are tested. For that reason, if the replication factor remains 1, and the number of infected individuals remains the same in each state, there will be far more reported cases in the fall, assuming testing rates increase. According to the NY Times, 34/50 states are below the standard testing threshold determined by the Harvard Global Health Institute. Nationwide, 690,000 tests are being conducted each day. The goal is ~2,000,000 daily tests. The US is currently testing only at ~35% of its target figure each day. Under-testing in the US not only accelerates the spread of the virus due to poor detection of cases, it will result in higher reported figures in later months when testing is ramped up. However, I am not insinuating that with 3x as many tests we would report 3x many cases. Testing has diminishing marginal returns; data shows that with each additional test, the \u201cpositive test rate\u201d decreases. The degree to which this testing rate disparity influences reporting is unclear. By examining positive test rates and gross testing rates in the US currently, a prediction on the degree of current underreporting can be made. Assuming by September gross testing targets are met, case detection could increase by 20-50%. Another complicating factor is that there is a real disparity between gross testing rates in different states. 14 states are currently exceeding testing targets. 3 states are at testing targets. However, these 17 states that have robust testing were more likely to have experienced a bad first wave of coronavirus.  We can think of dividing states into two categories: those which experienced a major March/April wave of infection, and those which did not.  From statewide data provided by the NY Times, we can determine some characteristics about these two categories, as well as which states belong to them. States with a March/April infection peak: 14 identified: \nCT, DC, DE, IL*, LA*, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT (*= not in Northeast) -These states experienced mass infection in spring, then a steep drop off ever since.\n-These states typically have robust testing.\n-These states are concentrated in the Northeast, and have similar climates (hot summer, cold winter)\n-June infection numbers were generally very low, and September will bring cooler weather, and the likely re-opening of schools\n-Schools and colleges are likely to be open in some capacity this fall\n-More re-openings are underway for these states, causing more infections Determining a base rate for these states is somewhat unclear, due to lack of historic data. However, I suggest that if these states have reached a steady state of infections, we would expect 50% of them to have a higher September total than June total (so 7). Because of the above reasons, however, I am assuming that the number of states with higher infection numbers in September than in June will be normally distributed around 9.8 (70% of 14), with a standard deviation of 3, assuming a 2/3\u2019s chance of this number being between 7 and 13.  States with a (roughly) monotonic increase since March 1, or a small March/April peak: This category includes the other 37 states.  -This category is more heterogeneous\n-Typically, gross testing rates are well below targets.\n-With no massive first wave, the governments of these states have underestimated the dangers of the novel coronavirus\n-These states (mostly) reported large infection numbers in June.\n-Re-openings began early but are now being paused (in some states).\n-In three months, it is likely that re-openings will be advancing once again. As a base rate, 50% of 37 is 18.5. I except by September 1st, gross testing rates will increase significantly, and a second reopening will full speed ahead. However, some of these states reported extremely high June infection numbers, which will be difficult to surpass. Because of this, I predict that in 55% of states in this category, we will see an increase in Novel Coronavirus cases. I predict that this can be expected to be normally distributed around 20, with a standard deviation of 7, due to the high uncertainty in this category. In order to come up with a final prediction, we must combine these two categories. My prediction is that the number of States (out of 51) that will have more cases in September than in June will be 30, with a standard deviation of 7.6 (sqrt(7^2 + 3^2)). To make this distribution valid for 55 states, both the mean and the standard deviation need to be increased by 55/51 for the final distribution ~ N(32,8). I then manually, slightly adjusted the distribution (primarily to account for unconsidered uncertainty) to come up with by final result: <4 - 0%\n4-11 - 3%\n12-19 - 8%\n20-27 - 24%\n28-35 - 35%\n36-43 - 24%\n>44 - 6% Currently we can assume that there will be no vaccine by Sept. 2020.

Around the end of June 2020 we observed a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases and it continuously break daily new cases record. Yesterday, July 11th, we have seen over 70k new COVID cases across United States. It is still unknown to us how the second wave will play out and how long the new cases increase will last. However, even if the upward trend for new cases is quickly controlled, it doesn\u2019t mean new cases will disappear overnight. Based on the first wave reaction in United States, we observe that the new cases capped around April 1st and hovered at essentially the same level for about 2 months and a half. Right now, state governments are essentially doing similar things to manage the spread of second wave COVID, as they do to manage the first wave. Therefore, it is highly probable that we will observe the new cases curve plateaued (higher daily number than June 2020) rather than sharply dropped to zero and I assign such probability 70%.

Given that it took hard hit areas like China and New York roughly 3 months to go \"up and down the mountain\" in Cuomo's words, the peak of each state's number of infected was roughly at the 1.5 month mark. Given that the aggressive growth rates of infection in harder hit states mirror NY's rates in the early few weeks, I am setting June 1st 2020 as week 1. This anchor point is flexible (you can shift it back ~1 month in the following analysis remain valid). Therefore, 3 months past Week 1 should return the state to levels near the beginning. This will be approximately August 31.  Given that the question is asking for a measurement in cases/ month, we see the month of August mirror June with a negative second derivative in terms of infection rates. Therefore, September numbers will be lower than August. Since June = August and September < August, September < June. Therefore, the mean for my post-likelihood adjusted numbers will be < 27.5.  I set the distribution to still be centered around 20-27 though. This is because the examples I used in my likelihood calculation took strict measures for containment. Many of the flare up cases are from conservative states whose residents are more likely to resist \"big government\" orders. Therefore, I shift the center of gravity of my distribution from 12-19 to 20-27.  These calculations are even despite a potential vaccine being developed. This is because initial manufacturing ramp up of the vaccine are likely to be slow as with any mass-scale manufacturing process (despite some efforts from Bill Gates and other US Gov't entities trying to get a jump start on manufacturing).

Research has indicated productivity has remained fairly high.\n- Many states are highly rural and protected from Covid, especially with lack of inter-state travel (<25% of year ago TSA checkpoint visits)\n- States will shut down faster than March, as we know the consequences now. Points against:\n- Mass testing likely to be even more ubiquitous in September\n- People will become more restless if forced to quarantine for an additional two months.\n- September aligns with return to higher education (universities) as well as K-12 schools. Students face smaller risks as compared to older generations, and are more likely to take risks, including not quarantining. In addition, smaller towns and cities dominated by pro-Trump sentiment may ignore possible risks, as Covid has become a political issue. This is backed by polls. Another poll of parents indicates up to 60% of them are considering home learning options, but this is a non-committal stance and is also likely to be correlated based on region.\n- It took about 2 months for states to start reopening, thus prodding this second wave in the states mentioned earlier.\n- Possible mutation of Covid adds tail risk\n- 75% of executives said around 50% of workers would be back in office by September 1st in a June 24 poll.

The problem is of course \"what is the probability p?\" and I have not made my mind about it.

This virus spreads fast with many asymptomatic people. I think we are unlikely to get a vaccine but closer to herd immunity than commonly believed. Even here in rural Oregon my gf got it in March and recovered and I was asymptomatic. In three Months we've gone from the fatality rate likely being 3.3% to the range being from 0.1% to 1% with most likely rate being 0.26%. in three months the threat has reducedto a tenth of what it was to being only 2-3 times as deadly as the flu. The likely number of asymptomatic people has also risen massively. Some populations have shown as many as 90% asymptomatic. Areas that test more than just the really sick show higher levels of asymptomatic people. As we get more data I expect things will continue to trend that direction of the virus being less deadly. I think it's likely most states will be nearing herd immunity by September.   The big wildcard to me is changes in the amount of testing.

I think this has been highly fear mongered though. the politically correct view is to  think of the disease as being terrible, and the current government and media treatment of this does not seem to match up with the science as we know it today. This gives me optimism that it is correct to bet against the crowd.  The largest clusters of infected have been in dense areas like nursing homes and prisons. Once the virus has gone through the nursing homes and prisons these cluster areas will become immune, reducing the overall infection numbers. The virus is less deadly than the flu for children, yet they are still talking about closing schools. Leave the schools open, the virus will go through the schools quicky, keep vulnerable people away from the kids the first two months, then the schools will have immunity.

Cases in the U.S. have been doubling about every two months. I see little stomach politically for another round of widespread lockdowns which alone raises the odds of increased infections due to high levels of community transmission that have never been brought under control. Unfortunately, I also see many states that opened early doubling down on being \"right\" and doubt they'll introduce mandatory mask wearing or other measures that could mitigate the spread.  From a purely political perspective, mitigation measures themselves have become the newest hot button issue and it's pervasive and infectious throughout whole communities. My daughter lives in a very Republican Missouri county where masks are banned in at least two businesses. It's become a part of one's identity to a wider degree than I think people realize. As we get closer to the Presidential election, considering how critical this race is, people will only become more obstinate. And that brings me to human behavior in general. An interesting poll from Deutsche Bank shows a consistent decline in people's \"tolerance for sacrifice\" to contain the virus. It's across the board in the U.K., Germany, France, and the U.S.. For instance, about 50% of people in the U.S. were willing to sacrifice seeing friends/family over the next three months as of March 31. By June 2, that had fallen closer to 45%. In France, where the virus is considered more under control, the rate fell from around 50% to near 20%.

The course of the pandemic so far suggests that undetected (untested and never reported) community spread can require a significant time period (months) before resulting in the kind of widespread transmission that can\u2019t be overlooked. Testing and and contract tracing are the key tools to avoid this trap, but there isn\u2019t nearly enough of it occurring, and that seems likely to persist, given the lack of support and coordination being offered by our federal government. More cases in September than June is a pretty low bar to clear, so I am fairly confident that it will be the case in most places. The bigger unknown is how testing will unfold. It\u2019s unfortunate, but in some states, political beliefs could have a significant impact on whether sufferers choose to be tested and counted, as is already the case with the use of face masks. Testing in general may fall out of favor in some states, with availability poor and political incentives to keep it that way. The other uncertainty for me involves timing. Numbers may or may not dip in the summer, with people often outdoors.

I tried to classify based on how likely I thought it was that the state would have more cases in September than June [1]. This was not too rigorous, but states hit hard (with a decent amount of immunity ~20-30%, NY, NJ) were seen as less likely. Also, states with a decent amount of infections and increasing new cases I think are less likely (California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina) [2]. States with few current cases were seen as more of a toss-up. I did not calculate these as independent variables, because I think they are going to be correlated, with most of the uncertainty coming from my estimate of the likelihood of each group. So, I tried to capture that by estimating a 20% range for each of the groupings. For example, the \"lean no\" grouping had between 25 and 45% chance of more cases in September than June. This process gave an answer between 10 and 21, but I skewed a bit lower because I think the possibility of a surprise lack of infection going forward is more likely than a surprise increase in infection. Also, re-opening is in full swing so we'll likely see the \"more infection\" surprise earlier rather than later, if it were to occur.  Other factors influencing this are the current protests, which favor more cases in June. On the other hand, more testing by September should offset this.

It just can\u00b4t get worse than \"superbad\", so I\u00b4m reducing the highest bucket and distributing it to the lower ones. http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-ihme-forecast-projects-nearly-135000-covid-19-deaths-us\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html#link-7b42d0f5"], [34499, "2020-05-05T07:41:44Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Assuming Covid returns in the fall, but September being a bit early."], [3434, "2020-05-05T05:56:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [88198, "2020-05-05T02:50:22Z", [0.4, 0.26, 0.16, 0.09, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01], "At present, projections show all states in the much fatter part of the curve in June than in September...to such an extent that I put a very intuitive probability that ZERO states will be Sept > June, if re-opening timing/measures are fairly responsible/effective (which is far from certain).
