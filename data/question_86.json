It seems that this local coverage (@morrell) is rather boastful of the exercises. In that I am only following this situation as part of the GJ activity, I've learned something from this article. Previously I thought the \"issue\" was the United States seeking to pressure the ASEANs to not cooperate with the Chinese as to naval exercises, as some show of anti-Chinese-expansion solidarity. I've learned that this perspective may be too simplistic, for the article frames the South Sea tension in terms of China versus not the U.S., but versus Japan! If this is true, then whoever came up with this (failed) U.S. strategy of \"blackballing\" the Chinese from naval exercises needs their head examined. It has completely backfired: the U.S. did not achieve ASEAN solidarity, an important ally (Japan) is also besmirched, and Cambodia rises in prominence in the so-called \"consensus-led\" ASEAN. If Japan were smart they would have distanced themselves from this \"plan\" before it began. If the U.S. wants to get serious in the South China Sea, even though they're so far behind the ball timewise, they need to escalate those faux-islands to the top international priority, skip the rhetoric that they want \"free navigation,\" and move directly to the declaration that any militarization of those faux-islands will be destroyed. China has fourteen days to remove any and all weapons or the U.S. just vaporizes them. Whatever \"strategy\" the U.S. is now undertaking is something, maybe, that was suitable before the first ton of sand was dredged to create those faux-islands. Once their construction began, only a hard-and-fast rule with a credible response was required. It's not too late to reverse the current (failed) policy that now not only fails to address the central issue of faux-islands, but is bringing down U.S. and ally policy alike in the entire region; and driving the ASEAN nations toward China, rather than empowering them (as Cambodia desires) to stand on their own. I give Cambodia (if sincere) a ton of credit for calling out the United States for having the audacity to frame the U.S.-Cambodia relationship in terms of China (or Japan).

This could further erode the credibility of ASEAN centrality, a concept that requires members to be united, given that full consensus is needed to achieve any result under the various ASEAN mechanisms. The majority of ASEAN members wish to maximize trade and investment ties with Beijing while maintaining a close security relationship with Washington. However, members countries have a range of positions when it comes to the Sino-U.S. rivalry. These positions can be broadly placed into one of three groups. Most of the claimants, but most notably the Philippines and Vietnam, have been highly critical of China. The Philippines has elected to renew the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the U.S., despite domestic criticism on the question of sovereignty and expanding content. This decision was motivated by anxiety at China\u2019s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea. As for Vietnam, although an alliance remains out of reach given resistance from hardline elements, relations with the U.S. are increasingly warm, and China is a factor in this. A second group of ASEAN members, notably Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, have been very keen to maintain strategic autonomy. Nevertheless, with a massive influx of Chinese investment, countries such as Indonesia that are in dire need of infrastructure have been struggling to preserve their neutrality. After work started on Indonesia\u2019s first ever high-speed rail link, a controversial Chinese project that will connect Jakarta and Bandung, Indonesia announced another megaproject that will be led by a Chinese state-owned electricity company. Although the Indonesian government has attempted to preserve its neutrality, for instance declining Beijing\u2019s invitation to conduct military drills in the South China Sea late last year, the country is clearly drawing closer to China. The third group includes Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos (CML), all countries determined to avoid any position that puts them directly at odds with China. Many observers concluded that Cambodia\u2019s failure in 2012 to agree on a communiqu\u00e9 owed to its decision not to corner its most important economic partner. The gaps between these already divergent positions are only likely to widen after ITLOS announces its decision, with a new round of friction likely. This will motivate claimants to step up their efforts to reassert their claims and to bolster security ties with external powers, especially the U.S. and Japan. Claimants such as Vietnam, depending on the outcome of the Philippines\u2019 case, may start their own legal processes. Members will also pressure various ASEAN meetings to address the challenges that China\u2019s claims present. This will put the non-claimants in the difficult position of having to choose between their fellow ASEAN members and China."], [14656, "2016-02-16T09:42:20Z", [1.0], "Upping, referencing @dkc."], [17002, "2016-02-16T01:35:42Z", [0.88], "16 Feb: Chatter of China-Cambodia nat disasters tho not necessarily naval exercises (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/133017) Devts:\n+ 16 Feb: Cambodia-China: - Not nec'ly maritime exercises Structural reasons (+/-):\n+ Indonesia poss. \n+++ Cambodia \n+ Myanmar exercises in Indian Ocean: - Too busy with dom politics \n?

Myanmar: \nAlso seems like it could be a good partner - but its navy seems to be relatively small.\nAdditionally, with the coming transition of power to a more US-friendly regime in Myanmar, I think they may not want to be seen conducting trainings with the Chinese.

Secondly, since the announcement by Russia of its intended participation, the only ASEAN country that I have seen potentially linked to this exercise would be Vietnam due to its Russian ties for weaponry, and I suppose that the Russian Navy still ties up at ol' Cam Rahn Bay.   OTOH, since the initial date of this announcement, Vietnam has become an interested party in the case in front of The Hague at the moment and has considered separately filing such a suit in the past. They now have an interest in presenting themselves as united with their ASEAN brethren given The Hague's decision to take up the suit.  Additionally, these are naval drills. Given the sensitivity to the South China Sea matter to power projection by the Chinese Navy from both its mostly completed fixed bases of operations and its Coast Guard and attendant \"fishermen\", an ASEAN country participating in such an exercise would give de facto acceptance of Chinese hegemony. Thus there would significant pressure on any such country to forego the invitation.

As jkbic points out, Russia and China are looking at hosting a multilateral exercise in May 2016. And Russia has strong ties to a number of ASEAN states, so it is fairly likely that at least one would be invited. Indonesia is also holding its Komodo 2016 exercise in April 2016. While it is not yet clear if China will join, they did participate in the last Komodo exercise in 2014. China and Indonesia also have relatively robust ties, so it seems unlikely that Jakarta would snub the Chinese by not inviting them.  Will continue to update as details on these two exercises firm up.

As a result, it seems likely that China and an ASEAN state will be involved in a naval exercises in the future.  Within the next six months though? This is where things get a bit more doubtful. Naval exercises presumably take planning and there don't appear to be any active plans in the works at the moment, so I'm starting my forecast at 60% and adjusting from there.  Updating strategy: will adjust downwards with the passage of time, unless there is news about an exercise actually being planned.
