The bill has seven Republican and seven Democratic sponsors, and aides said it has a good chance of eventually becoming law. It would set mandatory sanctions for anyone involved with Iran's ballistic missile program. And it would apply sanctions to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), putting into law sanctions imposed via executive order on individuals tied to what the bill's sponsors describe as Iranian support for terrorism. The IRGC, an elite military body, is powerful in Iranian politics and the economy. The legislation would also require the U.S. president to block the property of any person or entity involved in specific activities that violate the U.N. arms embargo on Iran. Iran has suggested about past proposed sanctions bills that they would violate the international nuclear agreement reached during the administration of former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a co-author of the measure, told Reuters the new bill had been written not to interfere with that accord. \"We assiduously worked to make sure that no provisions actually affect the agreement as it is,\" he said in an interview. Aides said the bill is expected to pass the Senate because of the breadth of its support. Its lead sponsors include Republican Senator Bob Corker, the foreign relations committee chairman, and Ben Cardin, the panel's ranking Democrat (para. 1-9). Zengerle, P. (2017).

The challenge raises the prospect of a confrontation with the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump because diplomats say Iran is only months away from reaching that cap. The 2015 deal restricts Iran's atomic activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against Tehran. One restriction is on its stock of heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, like an unfinished one at Arak that had its core removed under the accord (para. 1-3). Trump is a vocal critic of the deal who has said he wants to \"police that contract so tough they (the Iranians) don't have a chance\". His administration has stuck to the previous U.S. position (para. 8). \n\"Any excess heavy water in excess of the firm cap of 130 metric tons cannot remain in Iran,\" the United States said in a statement to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting last week. \nWestern officials say they are concerned that Tehran continues to produce heavy water far more quickly than it is consuming or selling it. It had 124.2 tonnes of heavy water on its territory a month ago. \nThe IAEA, which is policing the deal, told member states at a meeting on Feb. 28 that if Iran kept producing heavy water at the current rate, it would reach the 130-tonne limit by May, several diplomats who attended the meeting said (para. 8-11).

Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC\u2019s air forces, said the Hormuz 2 naval ballistic missile soared for about 155 miles before successfully hitting a floating target, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency. The IRGC is a force tasked with safeguarding Iran\u2019s Islamic system. It operates independently of the country\u2019s regular armed forces. The test took place \u201cin recent days,\u201d according to Tasnim\u2019s report. It wasn\u2019t clear where the missile was fired or what body of water it struck. The Hormuz 2 can strike floating vessels at a range of around 186 miles, the report said. A separate medium-range missile test Jan. 29 prompted President Donald Trump to impose new sanctions on people and companies connected to Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The sanctions, accompanied by his assertion Feb. 2 that Iran was \u201con notice\u201d for firing the missile, amounted to the new administration\u2019s first significant move to contain Iran. Historically tense relations between Washington and Tehran have increased under Mr. Trump, who this week included Iran among six Muslim-majority countries barred from obtaining U.S. visas under a revised executive order. The administration says the move is needed to keep terrorists out of the U.S (para. 1-8). Fitch, A. (2017). Iran Test Fires Medium-Range Ballistic Missile. The Wall Street Journal. World.

Asked if military force also was one of the options, the officials didn\u2019t rule it out.\nOne set of options has been outlined by Congress, which is preparing a measure targeting Iran\u2019s elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama had decided to let it become law without his signature.\n\"The administration has, and continues to use, all of the necessary authorities to waive the relevant sanctions\" lifted as part of the nuclear deal, Earnest said in a statement.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has 10 days after Congress passes a bill to sign it, veto it or do nothing. If Congress has adjourned, failing to sign it is a \"pocket veto\" that prevents the bill from becoming law. But if Congress is still in session, the bill becomes law with no signature. Although lawmakers have returned home for the holidays, Congress technically is still in session and holding \"pro-forma\" sessions this week.\nThough Obama's move doesn't prevent the sanctions renewal from entering force, it marked a symbolic attempt by the president to demonstrate disapproval for lawmakers' actions. The White House has argued that the renewal is unnecessary because the administration retains other authorities to punish Iran, if necessary, and has expressed concern that the renewal may undermine the nuclear deal (para 1-5).

In addition, Iran continued to produce heavy water during the two-week period after the IAEA learned and pointed out that it had reached the cap. 2) The quarterly IAEA report on Iran continues to lack critical information, but additional information we have learned implies that Iran continues to push the envelope of compliance, which can be interpreted as Iran not being fully compliant with the JCPOA. 3) The report does not discuss, and is cast in a way as to doubt, whether the inspectors have visited Iranian military sites, including the Parchin site, as part of its legitimate need to verify bans on certain nuclear weaponization activities and develop confidence in the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activity as mandated by IAEA safeguards and reinforced by the Additional Protocol. 4) We have learned that Iran has started feeding uranium into a ten machine IR-6 cascade. If true, this represents a significant development both due to the IR-6\u2019s higher separative work capacity and concerns about whether it is allowed to do so under its long term enrichment plan. 5) We have learned that Iran has used or will use an advanced IR-6 centrifuge for stable isotope work under a special project with Russia. The JCPOA allows stable isotope production (via enrichment or depletion) in the context of using IR-1 centrifuges. It makes no mention of using advanced centrifuges for this purpose. The long term enrichment and R&D program does not discuss any stable isotope production using advanced centrifuges. This use of the IR-6 is at odds with the stated JCPOA requirements. However, we do not know if the Joint Commission has made an exemption for the use of the IR-6 for stable isotope production or otherwise interpreted this use of the IR-6 as \u201cnot incompatible\u201d with the deal. 6) The IAEA reported that Iran\u2019s total enriched uranium stockpile did not exceed 300 kilograms (kg) of low enriched uranium (LEU) hexafluoride (or the equivalent in different chemical forms). However, this statement apparently ignores LEU exempted from this value by Joint Commission decisions based on a determination of its relative ease of recoverability. Thus, the use of total in the IAEA\u2019s statement may be inaccurate. As we have reported in our last quarterly report and in an earlier report, the total amount of LEU may exceed 300 kg and the basis for judging the material as nonrecoverable is suspect, reinforced by the overly secretive nature of the Joint Commission deliberations. 7) Overall, the IAEA effort in Iran needs to be strengthened and that strengthening should be fully supported by the Board of Governors and the P5+1. Institute Statement\nThe IAEA reporting continues to lack critical technical details about implementation of the agreement. The IAEA\u2019s sparse and overly generalized reporting borders on deception by omission and is contradicted by independent reporting pointing to problems in the implementation of the JCPOA, some of which are discussed below. This continued lack of information in the IAEA reports combined with the ongoing secrecy surrounding the decision-making of the Joint Commission is a serious shortcoming in the implementation of the JCPOA and raises legitimate questions about the adequacy of Iran\u2019s compliance. 1:  ISIS ANALYSIS OF IAEA REPORT:   http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/analysis-of-the-iaeas-fourth-iran-deal-report-time-of-change/#ref2\n2:  IAEA REPORT Nov 9, 2016:  http://isis-online.org/uploads/iaea-reports/documents/IAEA_Iran_Report_9Nov2016.pdf COMMENT:  Section D:  Tranparancy in the original IAEA report contains the following statement: (2)\n\"19.

Iranian state banks which financed Iran's ballistic missile development puts the lie to Washington's claims \u2013 stubbornly maintained for more than a year \u2013 that it was determined to rein in the Islamic Republic's expanding missile program.\nIn fact, the president's decision reflects a larger pattern of U.S. backtracking over Iran's ballistic missiles \u2013 one that dates back to well before the landmark U.S.-led global agreement with Iran over its nuclear program in July of 2015.\nDuring the U.S.-led negotiations over that agreement, the president decided they should focus squarely on Iran's nuclear program and not cover such related issues as Iran's development and testing of long-range ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads \u2013 despite the obvious tie between nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\nWith an agreement over Iran's nuclear program in place, U.S. officials argued, they could then pressure Iran over not only its ballistic missile program but also its sponsorship of terror, its efforts to destabilize Sunni nations in the region and its increasingly grotesque human rights record at home. \nBut the public record \u2013 of which the new revelation about sanctions relief is now a part, courtesy of The Wall Street Journal \u2013 reveals something far different: While negotiating and implementing the nuclear agreement, Washington took multiple steps that not only legitimized Iran's missile program but actually helped Tehran make further progress (para. 1-5).

As it turns out, under the Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), there are now limitations on what the IAEA is allowed to report. According to Amano, due to new U.N. Security Council and IAEA resolutions, the agency will only monitor and verify Iran\u2019s compliance with its JCPOA commitments and will no longer provide broad reporting on its nuclear program.
