Things do seem to be going better than they were in 2011 as described by the article referenced in the question statement (https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Census-fails-in-Macedonia-105372).\n(ii) Whether the problems have truly been mitigated may not matter too much. Even if there are still problems, because those in charge of completing the census believe these problems have been mitigated, they may still announce that they have completed the census. Issues about the census may simply occur later, such as when the results are published (and potentially challenged).\n(iii) The census may be completed before October 1st, but the announcement may only happen on the 1st of October (which is still a business day) or later. However, if the population is indeed in the 1.5-1.8m range, with 1.3m people registered as of the 24th at a rate of 100k people per day (https://balkaninsight.com/2021/09/24/north-macedonia-census-takers-rush-to-complete-head-count/) then everyone could be registered before the 30th of September with enough time to spare for an announcement that can be pre-drafted and published with a click. I do expect that the number of people registered per day might start falling as the registration rate increases, but It's hard to estimate by how much.\n(iv) I am not sure whether there is the possibility of a legal delay to the completion of the census as I have not been able to find a copy of the actual decree.

It not only about statistics as an end in itself and for EU reporting, but following the insight that statistics meeting standards are a precondition for effective, evidence-based and truthful governance and, not least, the foundation for many other instruments, tasks and government functions such as sound and effective planning, allocation of funds, for economic development and investment (economic convergence), fight against corruption/money laundering etc.: [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire#Chapters As of 06 October 2020, North Macedonia is \"moderately prepared\" to be able to \"assume aquis\" with respect to \"statistics\" (which is Chapter 18 in the \"October 2020 European Commission Report\"), which is in line with the majority of all 33 topics in which the aquis needs to be adopted.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_North_Macedonia_to_the_European_Union#Negotiation_progress In the report's history of 2011 through 2020, the aquis chapter 18 Statistics has always been reported as \"moderately prepared\", which means that currently this topic does neither hinder nor promote the timeline of any negotiation process. While topics such as company law (Ch. 6), Food Safety etc. (Ch. 12), Trans-European Networks (Ch. 21), Science&Research (Ch. 25) and Customs Union (Ch. 29) have at least for a few years been reported as on a \"Good level of preparations\", there are also a few sticking points at which the level of preparation is still insufficient, which will slow down the accession negotiations progress for the time being at least in these respective chapters:  Freedom of Movement For Workers (Ch. 2), Environment (Ch. 27), (probably) Financial Control (Ch. 32), certainly (!) Financial & Budgetary Provisions (Ch. 33).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_North_Macedonia_to_the_European_Union#Negotiation_progress (see \"Report history\" elapsed) With respect to the 2020 Report (\"North Macedonia 2020 Report  Accompanying the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions\" by full name [2]), the following statements can be extracted with respect to statistics in general and in connection with the perspectives of the census in particular from \"5.18 'Chapter 18' \" (pp. 80-82):\n/\"The  country  is moderately  prepared in  the  area  of  statistics. Good  progress was  made, especially  in  implementing  the  pilot  phase  of  the  population  census  and  testing  the  new census  methodology  that  partly  relies  on  administrative  data.  Improvements  are  noted  in  all statistical areas and further aligning of sectoral statistics with EU standards. Continued efforts are needed to improve the scope and data quality of macroeconomic and social statistics. As the last year\u2019s recommendations were carried out, in the coming year, the country should in particular:\n~adopt  the  legislation  and ensure  the  necessary  administrative  capacities  to  carry  out  the population census in 2021\n[...]\"\n/\"On classifications and registers, the main classifications comply with the EU acquis and are updated regularly. Progress was noted in the use of administrative data sources, including for preparing   the   population   census.   A population   register   was   made   operational.   Data availability and quality improved but still need to be optimised. Data transmission to Eurostat further increased but remains incomplete\"\n/\"Good  progress  was  made  on social  statistics,  with  the  successful  completion  of  the  pilot population   census   using   the   combined   methodology   and   computer-assisted   personal interview.  However,  the  Parliament  has  yet  to  adopt  the  census  law  and  the  census  is postponed  to  2021\" \"EU rules  require  that  Member  States  are  able  to  produce  statistics  based  on  professional independence,  impartiality,  reliability,  transparency,  and  confidentiality.  Common  rules  are provided for the methodology, production and dissemination of statistical information\" ([2], p. 80) [2] https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/north_macedonia_report_2020.pdf In order for the stalled accession process to accelerate, North Macedonia has a strong incentive to execute the census as one one of the topics and tasks to be accomplished before a chapter of the negotiation process will be able to be opened as fast as possible."], [93350, "2021-01-11T08:36:07Z", [0.5], "The arguments amongst the political entities appear to be two-fold.\nShould absentee citizens be allowed to offer their data given that many (including families have vacated to Western Europe and if third parties are acting in proxy, is this valid?\nThe second issue is the nature of the census and how the collected will be used.

Since it's been so long since I've done the census, obviously a census in such a small country it's not that important. So it's not like North Macedonia will stop functioning if this doesn't happen which means the opposition will have a lot of room to oppose this.
