Annual risk of death for someone 35 years old is about 1/1000 for an American.  Given Kim's affluent  lifestyle and BMI, we are probably similar to that distribution.  So for a one month period that is about 1/10,000, but neglects the chance of political death, which is probably higher.   Perhaps a better approach is to ask if there's a uniform distribution on the possibility of being overthrown, what monthly value corresponds to a particular chance over 10 years.   In that case, I'd still estimate rather low based on the stability of other stable dictatorships outside the middle East.  Since we're limited to non fractional percentages here, are we closer to 0% or 1%?   Natural death starts to be relevant here, but not by very much.  At 1% monthly, over 120 months (10 years) of bernoullie trials that corresponds to about a 36% chance of death.  But bernoulli trials will tend to overestimate.  At 0.05%, it's more like 33% over the 10 years.  So IMO this analysis would lead ustoward the 0% side of the spectrum, but a 1% value is not much error. Ultimately I'm going with 1% because I believe that autocratic regimes probably run at increased risk of failure as they age, for a variety of reasons, but chiefly the economic impacts of sanctions and corruption."], [1333, "2018-08-30T15:11:30Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2018-08-30T13:03:49Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-08-29T19:24:05Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2018-08-29T14:50:05Z", [0.02], ""], [172, "2018-08-29T12:39:57Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-08-29T11:54:03Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-08-28T20:53:32Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-08-28T12:45:43Z", [0.0], ""], [60513, "2018-08-27T20:41:33Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-08-27T16:23:18Z", [0.0], ""], [60497, "2018-08-27T13:19:47Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-08-27T12:06:03Z", [0.0], ""], [60473, "2018-08-27T09:33:26Z", [0.01], "Kim Jong Un-type leaders often finish their career with surprising events.

In Japan, I was friends with an American expert on North Korea, Bradley Martin, and I read his book \"Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader\" as well as his numerous articles on the topic. Kim Jong Un is solidly in power. He is at least as ruthless and powerful within North Korea as Stalin was in the USSR. Even though he owes his position to the inherent respect Korean culture accords family ties, he has had family members executed, including his uncle (his mother's sister's husband, I think, certainly not a blood relative). He has also had a general executed for falling asleep during a meeting. His meeting with US President Donald Trump was something neither his father or grandfather ever achieved. HOWEVER, China is upset with him. A few weeks before the summit and shortly after a nuclear test, Kim went to China on a state visit. I suspect (and this is just a hunch) he was given a dressing down with China threatening to hinder all trade. China has proped up the North Korean regime because it does not want it to fall, either to be absorbed by South Korea or to become a part of China. The former scenario would put American troops on their doorsteps, the latter would cost a fortune. However North Korea's nuclear and missile tests have exasperated China and the last one may have been one too many, hence Kim's trip to China. I originally gave a 5% chance, which is what I think for any one year like this one. Given that there are only three months left until the end of the test period, I divided by 4 and rounded, so 1 percent.

The only real possibility of Kim Jong-un stepping down would be in an overthrow of his rule, which could become a possibility either from an uprising within the Communist Party or a popular revolt. In order for a popular revolt to have any chance of occurring, the economic conditions in North Korea must become very dire and they certainly are on their way, especially with the new rounds of sanctions by the West and China's willingness to begin enforcement of their sanctions as well. However, it can be assumed that a dictator such as Kim Jong-un would have an interest in prolonging his rule for as long as possible. Therefore, he must raise the living standards of the North Korean people, which can only be achieved through negotiation on the possible removal of sanctions. So far, Kim Jong-un has been willing to compromise and hold talks. He sent a delegation to South Korea for the Olympics and will be meeting with the South Korean President at the end of April. There are also negotiations underway for Kim Jong-un to meet with President Trump after his meeting with the South Korean leader. Although the sudden shift in policy may be surprising, North Korean defector Ri Jong Ho sees this as perfectly understandable. Ri explains that North Korea's economy is in a dire situation and Kim Jong-un has an interest in preserving his rule. Kim Jong-un remains distrustful of China and believes that the US will be instrumental in his ability to retain power. Ri's revelations show that Kim Jong-un is aware of the problems facing his country and he is willing to negotiate. However, talks and negotiation may not be enough to lift sanctions. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon has stated that talks must be followed by substantive action and despite Kim Jong-un's willingness to negotiate, he must also be willing to make compromises. Whether Kim Jong-un agrees to such compromises remains to be seen, however, there is a possibility with talks underway for substantive action to occur, and if they do, would certainly extend his rule for the foreseeable future.  http://www.newsweek.com/kim-jong-uns-economy-could-totally-collapse-within-year-high-level-north-687104\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/10/kim-jong-un-breaks-silence-talks-donald-trump/\nhttp://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/03/08/0200000000AEN20180308013551315.html\n"], [368, "2018-04-10T17:18:44Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-04-10T16:35:15Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-04-10T02:18:09Z", [0.0], ""], [172, "2018-04-10T00:07:01Z", [0.0], ""], [52446, "2018-04-09T20:42:14Z", [0.0], "No way for any internal opposition to form.

Kim's hold on power is not completely assured until October, any more than Maduro's or even Trump's.  2% is way too low.  20% is more accurate.  Three possible scenarios: (1) Kim Jong Un is assassinated or deposed.  This is always a possibility in governments like North Korea's.  The fact that he has not yet been, or that his grandfather and father were not, assassinated or deposed could have been a fluke for all we know.  The fact is we don't know how loyal the elites are within Kim's circle and amongst the North Korean people (who are getting creamed again by the sanctions).  It therefore seems to me wrong to assign a very low probability (like only 2%) to this eventuality.  Perhaps 7-8% is better in order to account for unknowns, which are many, as well as for historical experience, which indicates that dictatorial regimes can collapse quickly and unexpectedly like a house of cards.   (2) Kim could die from health complications.  He is morbidly obese and his access to decent medical care is questionable.  Of course, he is younger, so this is less likely.  1-2% (3) Kim is taken out in an armed conflict with the US - for instance, after a failed face-to-face negotiation with Trump, which causes Trump to lose face and look weak, and thus attack North Korea.  This is not so implausible given Trump is an inexperienced, untested, insecure, and deeply unstable President, who will be relying on a belligerent national security advisor (John Bolton) who has supported invasions of North Korea and Iran in the past.  This risk plus the more general risk of miscalculation make this probability at least 10-12%.  Unfortunately, I think the risk of a nuclear conflict, in general, is much higher than 2%.

If the two countries make an agreement and then North Korea breaks it, which the country has been known to do, the probability of conflict may increase. More importantly one expert argues, \"If North Korea does decide to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for a security guarantee from the US and then they open up the country, think about how much political influence South Korea will try to wage, think of Western society rushing in and the influence of outside information.\" Further, he argues that newly empowered North Koreas will find financial liberation and could mobilize to overthrow North Korea's leader.

So far the only way for such an event is the death of such person (i.e. Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il). There is certainly a small chance of a coup in this case, but any attempt of overthrowing the head of state would lead to a full scale war (a civil war if it was an interval conflicts between factions, and a full-scale war which probably involves South Korea and its allies, US and Japan, and possibly led to the World War III).

I believe that North and South Korea growing closer and becoming more optimistic towards their relations even further reduces the chances of foreign intervention, assassination, or military coup removing Kim Jong-un as leader of North Korea. If South Korea maintains calm and productive diplomatic relations with North Korea, it is highly unlikely that any South Korean allies, such as Japan or the U.S., would intervene to remove Kim Jong-un. Further, Kim Jong-un still maintains tight control over North Korean elites and the military, so military coup or assassination remain extremely unlikely. Finally, improved North and South Korean relations if anything (although it is unlikely) could cause leniency in sanctions and North Korean economic opening, which could possibly reduce the chances of total North Korean state collapse. So far, the successful North and South Korean cooperation in these Olympics makes it even less likely than before the games began that Kim Jong-un will cease to lead North Korea. \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/01/08/sport/north-korea-south-korea-talks-winter-olympics-2018-pyeongchang/index.html "], [39562, "2018-02-19T17:11:34Z", [0.05], ""], [27367, "2018-02-19T13:03:19Z", [0.02], ""], [1034, "2018-02-19T07:35:07Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-19T02:08:51Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-18T23:29:58Z", [0.0], ""], [1380, "2018-02-18T15:39:21Z", [0.7], "Si une Op\u00e9ration militaire est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 avant cette date !"], [37893, "2018-02-18T08:08:30Z", [0.05], ""], [1972, "2018-02-18T07:35:02Z", [0.0], ""], [26030, "2018-02-18T05:16:33Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2018-02-18T00:42:23Z", [0.0], ""], [52343, "2018-02-17T23:44:56Z", [0.0], ""], [53646, "2018-02-17T22:41:19Z", [0.01], ""], [29984, "2018-02-17T13:13:00Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2018-02-17T08:53:04Z", [0.0], ""], [53452, "2018-02-17T00:29:14Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2018-02-16T21:05:34Z", [0.0], ""], [50681, "2018-02-16T14:20:00Z", [0.05], ""], [1034, "2018-02-16T08:26:51Z", [0.0], ""], [9755, "2018-02-15T23:29:23Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-02-15T22:26:42Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-15T19:00:33Z", [0.0], ""], [49162, "2018-02-15T17:03:20Z", [0.16], "As far as natural causes of death go, Kim Jong-un is quite young and age combined with the best medical care in the country leads us to a ~1% end of tenure.

Analysts have predicted that North Korea will collapse for years, yet they have been wrong time and time again. An assassination would also be highly risky.  An article published in the Journal of Asian Security and International Affairs in 2017 found the prospect of a rebellion occurring in North Korea remains highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. According to mainstream theories about rebellion, numerous factors exist in North Korea that should push the population to rebel. However, the motivators for rebellion are suppressed by the regime through things like deterrence, isolation and propaganda.  Last year, a study published by RAND also found the most likely way to remove Kim from power would be for elite members of the regime to turn on their leader and stage a coup. The researchers argued the five conditions that would need to be met in order for top officials of the regime to believe a reunification of North and South Korea would be beneficial are: ensuring their individual safety, maintaining their positions, protecting their wealth, ensuring the safety and privileges of their family and the chance to do \"something meaningful for their country.\" However, analysts believe that nothing will be enough to convince a North Korean officials to betray the regime because Kim has instilled so much fear for their lives. The regime keeps a very close eye on people in any position of power and the punishments for disloyalty are very costly. Also, a coup has never been successfully administered in North Korea.  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2347797017732227\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/can-north-koreas-elites-oust-kim-jong-un/a-39091374 "], [53068, "2018-02-13T18:49:53Z", [0.04], ""], [53068, "2018-02-13T18:39:43Z", [0.05], ""], [52964, "2018-02-13T16:34:30Z", [0.01], ""], [40299, "2018-02-13T16:24:08Z", [0.02], "gray war; olympics gives perception of a unification.

Among wealthy nations the mortality rate of a 30-35 y.o. male is ~0.15%.

Following a bloody purge of officials and family, especially with ties to China, Kim Jon-un has centralized power around himself and appears more secure today than even this time last year, which leads to...\n(iii) Chinese intervention deposes Kim Jong-un -- China kept Kim Jong-un's exiled brother as a bargaining chip and/or backup for a Chinese-backed regime change.

Xi Jinping likely won't make a hasty decision with a nuclear power directly across their border.\n(iv) Another intervention deposes Kim Jon-un -- e.g., US military conflict.

Dictators with a cult of personality do not leave office until they die or are forced out. See Ludwig, King of the Mountain. \n2. Sanctions strengthen dictators within their country. Kim is a demi-god in their mythology. And sanctions are a kind of attack. As Ghandi said, \"It worked on the British because they have a conscience.\" Sanctions are similar. Starving people don't rise up unless conditions are right. Read your Stalin. \n3. Sanctions and closed borders create opportunities on the black market. I've seen this pretty up close in other places. The idea that sanctions are really what they are on paper is laughable. That kind of thinking is a product of people in the Western world who never lived in a poor area.  Neither Russia nor China has that good of control over their border if they want to. It's like ours with cocaine. \n4. The USA supports the coup in Ukraine (with stationing of the US vice president's son in the country to collect Burisma oil stock and get rich). The USA calls the people of Ukraine who did not overthrow their government, \"the rebels\" which is full Orwellian doublespeak. The USA then sanctioned Russia for taking Crimea back after the province voted to do that overwhelmingly. Ukraine is the soft underbelly of Russia and Russia was promised it would be off limits. This put Russia on a war footing, because Russia has been invaded multiple times from Europe. This showed Russia and China that US words mean nothing and they cannot trust us. So, they adjusted. NK was a pain in the ass to Russia for most of its post-soviet period. But now, NK serves a purpose. Saber-rattling mad dog to distract the white house and cause trouble. A dangerous dog because NK has been able to hit some major cities in Russia for a while. \n5. China has also paid attention to Ukraine. China and Russia both see the Ukraine revolution as a sign of US aggression intending to overthrow them. China wants to expand its sphere into the  South China Sea. So, China also rediscovered the utility of NK. For a long time China's interest was declining. NK has had nuclear missiles aimed at Beijing for a long time. Starting with Obama's South China sea confrontation, what happened? NK postured and the US press went nuts and the White House got overwhelmed. Tillerson and Trump beat the drums against China trade, and boom. NK forces Tillerson to come on bended knee for help. All very jolly for China. \n6. The more sanctions we put on NK, the more we put Kim Jong-Un in the hands of Russia and China, mostly China. He has to dance for his dinner. \n7. China and Russia both want NK right where it is. NK has a job, and that job is to be a bulwark against US troops on the continent. China will not allow US troops to be within driving distance of Beijing any more than we would let Chinese troops do that to Washington, DC. \n8. Even in the unlikely event that the Trump administration actually convinces Kim that he has no better option than to launch his missiles at the USA and all the US installations in the Pac Rim, Kim will survive. I rather think China prefers to have the USA as a trading partner, but Kim won't die in any war. China would sweep down the peninsula with their troops to occupy it, and they would put Kim under house arrest for the rest of his life.  I think that for China and Russia, the idea that NK has missiles that can hit the USA now is alright with them because they have been in that position for a long time now. So it's just evening things up. I don't think either country is exactly at ease with Kim. He's a loose cannon for them as well. But he's a useful one, far too useful to give up, so they will try very hard to keep him in play. They like Kim creating a ruckus as long as it doesn't get too out of hand. China and Russia are both much more aware of the dangers of unleashing the dogs of war than the USA is today.  In summary: Those \"observers\" are fantasizing. Kim leaving office is a snowball's chance on the sun.

However, at his age, sudden death would be suspicious and the plotters would risk being publicly fed alive to dogs or whatever. Alternatively, the US could take him out. But that would be a colossal mistake.  I see Kim Jong Un as the equivalent of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, with elements of Elvis Presley, Jesus Christ and Kim Kardacian on top of it all, arguably making his citizens, on average, adore him more than any citizenry may have adored any other world leader in modern times. When the US forced Japan into an unconditional surrender, it enlisted Hirohito as an ally. Because a majority of the public believed that Hirohito and his wife were divine beings, they instantly flipped from willing to die by the millions to oppose US invading forces to abject cooperation. Then when Hirohito announced that he was just a human being, no godhood at all, the public was  like, OK, fine, lets get on with peace and prosperity. So even if the US were to make war against North Korea, it would be in the interest of the invader to co-opt him, Hirohito style. Here's why I say this. Kim Jong Un heads Juche, a North Korean version of Japan's Shinto religion. Shinto was what kept most of the Japanese public believing in Hirohito's godhood.  Differences: instead of coming froman ancient lineage of emperors, Kim Jong Un's grandfather Kim Il Sung descended from heaven to Mount Paektu, one of the world's most dangerous active volcanoes, and both he and the volcano are worshiped as divine entities. Kim Il Sung proceeded to lead the successful battle to drive out the Japanese occupiers, and founded a comunist-style dictatorship. Now, every public place, every factory, every home has, at the very least, a shrine to this Juche religion. Factories and slave labor camps have complete chapels, even slave labor camps exported to cut lumber in Russia's Siberia. Kim Jong Un's father and grandfather are believed to still be active in the affairs of their nation, from their thrones in heaven. When Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, died at a relatively young age, the 20-something (DOB disputed) playboy was not well prepared yet for godhood. You can see videos of his partying with his hero, Dennis Rodman, and other dissolute westerners at Vice News. Also you can see an abandoned Siberian slave labor camp and its chapel at Vice News. So in the fall of 2014, suddenly the playboy disappeared from view for months, with just vague official news about his \"arduous journey.\" When Kim Jong Un resurfaced, there were no more signs, in public at least, of the drunken playboy. No more would he pal around with Dennis Rodman, as Rodman apparently learned when he traveled to North Korea recently. Instead, Kim Jong Un began behaving like Jesus Christ did after his resurrection. Ever since, the young god pops up more than once per week on average, at factories, military activities, even at the crest of Mount Paektu. That Mount Paektu scene -- amazing. A group of soldiers were making the pilgrimage to the crest of the steaming volcanic crater in the dead of winter, snow on the ground, and there on rhe crest stood Kim Jong Un, bareheaded in the wind. And then as publicity photos recorded it, he engaged in group hugs. Other times, the young god might turn up in public and publicity videos show surprised women and men running to greet him, faces radiant with religious ecstacy, and they get to touch him and hug him. Or the young god might surprise his people with gifts to all children in his holy kingdom. Is there anywhere else in the world where on almost a daily basis, crowds of people may surround their leader and get to touch or even hug him or her? This is much more unstructured than US Presidents in a handshake line. Bodyguards are nowhere near in the publicity photos and videos, and nobody lines up, they just crowd politely and adoringly around their young god. Clearly, Kim Jong Un has established himself as so charismatic  that nobody would dare depose him."], [40642, "2017-11-08T22:54:42Z", [0.01], ""], [18846, "2017-11-08T21:53:57Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-08T21:36:42Z", [0.02], "Probably not, but have you ever seen \"Sleeper?\"  "], [12879, "2017-11-08T20:20:56Z", [0.05], "Oops \ud83d\ude2c  on my part.... need to read the question correctly before submitting prediction.
