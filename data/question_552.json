While the value of the renminbi is down a bit from where it was in early June, it's not down dramatically.  With no news reports of a massive depression having hit this month in China, it seems quite unlikely that the renminbi will have suffered sucha a dramatic decline in value of domestic plus international transactions since June that it'll be #8 when the July data comes out in the August report.

So let's look at where the relevant currencies were July 13th versus the dollar compared to May 14, and thus get a sense of what the value change would do to the rankings: The pound is down about 2.5%.\nThe yen is down about 2.5%.\nThe renminbi is down about 5.7%.\nThe Canadian dollar is down about 2.7%.\nThe Australian dollar is down about 1.5%.\nThe Hong Kong dollar is about even.\nThe Swiss franc is about even. So, at the same volumes as May, we would expect the SWIFT percentage share for the renminbi in July to decline a bit compared to the other currencies in the 3-to-9 range, but not enough to actually make it drop a rank from #5 to #6. Now, we also know, thanks to SWIFT, that the renminbi is pretty low volume in cross-border transactions anyway, so a decline in cross-border transactions would have to be unusually severe to seriously move the renminbi's rank down on the \"Domestic and International Payments\" chart. Thus, the question is, has there been a serious decline in the share of SWIFT-recorded domestic Chinese transactions as a percentage of overall SWIFT-recorded transactions in July compared to May?  Because, given the small size of the currency value decline and the lack of exposure on international transactions, that is the mechanism by which the renminbi could be dragged all the way down from its May rank of #5 to a July rank of #8. (I might actually allocate some percentage to that if I weren't so high above the consensus for a rank of 8+ on my older predictions, given that China wouldn't be eager to announce that it's had a recession.) We'll also note, for the people still giving any percentage to a rank of #1 to #3, that given the known changes in value, the renminbi needs to more-than-double total transaction volume over May in order to get to #3 in July, and needs a whole quadrupling unless there is a massive, like 50%, decline in pound transactions.  You hear anything about a sudden, unexpected massive supercharging of the Chinese economy, or a Great Depression-level collapse in Britain, in the last six weeks?

Plus the overall culture of abortion is proof of a low moral government. I was under the impression that talent is considered of the utmost importance and rigourous training is evident from their olympics status and abilities overall being stellar and the top always. They aim to maintain maximum quality and are still competing in this frame of mind against the world powers. I know they had a CIA special agent perform in the ski olympics segment and was not trained so to speak and was testing the overall trining ability and comprehensive level of the competition-this was self evident in his style and interpretation for how to maneuver and then wiped out ;) I believe this was one of his first test runs and a matter of ability over discipline research and was taught how to at least take a wipe out well.

So, if you think the equivalent of the data set labeled \"international payments currency\" when the question was framed is going to be used to resolve the question, you should heavily favor a resolution  of \"#4 - #7, inclusive\".  If you think the equivalent of the data set labeled \"international payments currency\" in the latest report is going to be used to resolve the question, you should heavily favor a resolution of \"More than #7\".

What SWIFT reports have called \"share as an international payments currency\" -- on page 5 of the October report, for example ( https://www.swift.com/file/45006/download?token=6GKon__P ) -- explicitly includes \"domestic and cross-border\" transactions, not just cross-border transactions. \"Domestic\" transactions in London as a financial center (like trades on the London Stock Exchange) drive much of the pound's use by SWIFT measures (since the pound is only 3.84% by share as a cross-border currency and the British economy in terms of GDP is much smaller than the Japanese).  The only way the pound sees a massive decline in value-of-transaction-share is if London as a financial center collapses relative to the rest of the international economy.  Even if the pound as a currency declined massively, that wouldn't be enough; things like LSE-listed stocks with large international operations would see their share prices in pounds go up to match the value of their overseas operations, so value-of-trades would not decline as precipitously.  You'd have to see something like LSE-listed multinationals delist themselves and move to other exchanges en masse for some reason.  Or perhaps the detonation of a nuclear bomb in London. The renminbi, on the other hand, doesn't have a major international exchange with companies with large non-Chinese operations listed.  Further, it's not a factor of more than two above #8 the way that the pound is above the yen.  To drop to #8, the a mere 20% decline in the value of the renminbi relative to other international currencies would suffice, assuming nominal domestic volume didn't increase much.  And since the renminbi's not fully liquid in the international market and relatively little-used in cross-border trade (it's only ranked #8 in cross-border currencies, 0.98% by volume), local stickiness of prices and wages should hold at least in the short term, so domestic inflation wouldn't push the nominal volume up quickly. So, for the renminbi to become #3, it takes a sudden, massive, unprecedented end of London as a financial and trading center on the order of months COMBINED with the renminbi climbing rapidly to pass the yen (when it's currently at about half the yen).  For the renminbi to become #8, it takes something as ordinary as its government deciding to goose exports by devaluing its currency moderately, or a medium-sized run by spooked international traders."], [691, "2018-02-12T17:27:05Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2018-02-12T07:48:01Z", [0.09, 0.9, 0.01], ""], [368, "2018-02-11T21:11:29Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [36188, "2018-02-11T17:00:57Z", [0.01, 0.92, 0.07], ""], [19801, "2018-02-11T04:42:56Z", [0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [19801, "2018-02-11T04:39:36Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [368, "2018-02-11T03:54:04Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-02-10T19:51:13Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [212, "2018-02-10T14:23:01Z", [0.01, 0.97, 0.02], ""], [49089, "2018-02-10T14:21:50Z", [0.0, 0.99, 0.01], "In order for the yuan to break into the top 4 currencies for international payments (currently #5), it would have to become more popular than either the dollar, euro, pound sterling, or yen, in an environment where its share of the international payments market has declined from 2.31% in December 2015 to 1.61% in December 2017.  There are inherent disadvantages for the yuan in these comparisons, namely the fact that the People's Bank of China is the most state-regulated of the banks in the upper echelons of these rankings. This is a root cause of why international use of the yuan has declined over the past two years. A specific cause recently was the People's Banks attempts to curb capital outflows and declines in CNY deposits in offshore accounts, particularly in Hong Kong, a massive clearing center for CNY on the international market.  One has to consider the possibility of China's reversal of these policies, the likelihood that one of the \"big 4\" suddenly implodes or if another \"peer\" currency, like the Canadian dollar, continues to compete with the yuan. Over the next 5 months, the most likely outcome is that the trends observed continue. CNY will almost certainly remain at #5, possibly #6 if the Canadian dollar continues to improve."], [48637, "2018-02-10T13:02:41Z", [0.08, 0.9, 0.02], "I forecast a 90% that the Chinese RMB will remain between the 4th and 7th rankings as an international payments currency as of July 2018.

I do believe it will surpass the yen within 18 months, but stands little chance of catching the Pound sterling until the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is more fully realized over at least a five year period. The Chinese government is a careful regulator over its financial system, particularly in measures to stem the RMB moving overseas for property and other purchases. Although there are signs of the RMB moving toward a greater share of international payments such as Pakistan announcing the RMB will be used for its bilateral trade and investment with China, and the agreements around the BRI, the Chinese government wants to see and will only allow a gradual and controlled RMB growth.
