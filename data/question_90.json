Reasons Turkey might want to cancel it\n-Russia has signed a contract with Egypt and is pursuing opportunities in other countries. \n-the sharp drop in oil prices has dented the amount the Russian state allocates to its nuclear industry,\n-doubts about whether Russia can meet its nuclear power plant export commitments to potential new customers. \n-withdrawal from the Akkuyu project would allow Russia to redirect much-needed funds to nuclear export commitments to more friendly countries. \". . . because of its financial exposure, Moscow is under more pressure than Ankara to assess whether the project can actually be completed under these conditions.  \" . . . both Ankara and Moscow may have an incentive to end their cooperation, rather than accept risks that could be amplified by worsening political ties. \"The main obstacle to denouncing the deal\u2014for either party\u2014is the threat of being liable for sizeable compensation. Interestingly, the Turkey-Russia Intergovernmental Agreement (link in Turkish) that provides the legal framework for the nuclear power project includes no direct compensation provisions. But it does incorporate provisions for the international arbitration of disputes. Turkey and Russia also have a bilateral agreement for the protection of mutual investments that could be used to initiate compensation claims. \" . . .  each side will likely refrain from unilateral measures that would trigger compensation claims. As a result, the project is likely to stall, with Turkey raising regulatory obstacles to deter licensing efforts, and Russia less willing to spend significant funds on a project clouded in uncertainty. Akkuyu\u2019s fate will probably remain unclear until either both sides can reach an agreement on compensation, or there is a clear improvement in the political relationship, which at the moment doesn\u2019t look likely. \n~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/possible-new-partner-for-akkuyu-nuclear-power-plant-.aspx?PageID=238&NID=98637&NewsCatID=402 May 3, 2016:  \"Russia was going to sell its 49 percent shares in the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant.

This silence, though, should not be construed as an indication that the future of the project is secure. Rather, it is a reflection of the prevailing uncertainty about the consequences of a unilateral withdrawal. Unlike more traditional nuclear power projects, in which the host state takes on direct or indirect financial liabilities, the build-own-operate model seems to grant Turkey a larger margin in which to maneuver should it want to cancel the project. The main reason Turkey might want to move in this direction would be if it believed that the newly antagonistic relationship with Moscow would preclude close safety and security cooperation with Rosatom. For instance, nuclear-facility builders must plan for the physical protection of a plant based on a threat assessment (known as the design basis threat). To what extent will the Turkish state be ready to share with Rosatom the national security analysis required to come up with the assessment? At the operational phase, how sound can security collaboration be between Turkish law enforcement and the Akkuyu plant\u2019s management? How effective could dialogue be if a cyber attack targeted Turkey\u2019s critical electricity infrastructure\u2014including its nuclear power plant\u2014especially given that Russia-based hackers have mounted sustained attacks on Turkish government web sites since the plane incident ? The unease caused by such questions could lead Turkish authorities to seek to annul the Akkuyu deal. From Russia\u2019s perspective, the Akkuyu project had particular significance as the first time it had facilitated the export of its reactors with the help of a BOO model. Since the Akkuyu deal was agreed in 2010, though, Russia has signed a contract with Egypt on the basis of similar commitments, and is pursuing opportunities in other countries. Meanwhile, the sharp drop in oil prices has soured fiscal balances and dented the amount the Russian state allocates to its nuclear industry, raising doubts about whether Russia can meet its nuclear power plant export commitments to potential new customers. So a withdrawal from the Akkuyu project would allow Russia to redirect much-needed funds to nuclear export commitments to more friendly countries.\nhttp://thebulletin.org/end-moscow-ankara-nuclear-cooperation9059\n* * *\nNOTE:\nThese three para make a clear argument that the Akkuyu Project doesn't have a future."], [306, "2016-03-11T05:25:32Z", [0.45], ""], [11686, "2016-03-11T03:03:13Z", [0.55], ""], [306, "2016-03-11T01:44:34Z", [0.55], ""], [306, "2016-03-11T01:43:41Z", [0.5], ""], [14208, "2016-03-11T01:29:19Z", [0.33], ""], [691, "2016-03-10T14:57:16Z", [0.3], ""], [13377, "2016-03-10T09:33:05Z", [0.5], ""], [38, "2016-03-10T08:34:02Z", [0.77], "http://www.dailysabah.com/money/2016/03/07/france-to-continue-cooperation-with-turkey-on-nuclear-projects \" France's ambassador to Ankara, Charles Fries, said the Akkuyu Nuclear Plant Project has not been suspended, though Fries does not want to speculate on the future of the project.\n~~~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  \" . . . does not want to speculate on the future . . ???\"  That sounds very tentative to me!"], [14208, "2016-03-10T01:34:03Z", [0.15], "Comment deleted on Oct 22, 2016 06:20PM UTC"], [14027, "2016-03-09T23:24:17Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2016-03-09T20:41:00Z", [0.29], ""], [1122, "2016-03-09T07:32:03Z", [0.45], ""], [13942, "2016-03-09T05:57:46Z", [0.2], ""], [13947, "2016-03-09T00:05:43Z", [0.45], ""], [691, "2016-03-08T21:58:16Z", [0.28], ""], [306, "2016-03-08T06:20:32Z", [0.55], "hmm.."], [306, "2016-03-08T06:17:21Z", [0.4], ""], [102, "2016-03-08T05:04:28Z", [0.44], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/gitrep-7mar16pm/"], [1708, "2016-03-08T04:24:47Z", [0.45], ""], [12701, "2016-03-07T20:56:07Z", [0.65], ""], [691, "2016-03-07T18:39:06Z", [0.28], ""], [21514, "2016-03-07T05:58:21Z", [0.15], "Russia needs the money, Turkey needs the power"], [13377, "2016-03-07T03:58:11Z", [0.45], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2016/03/05/manual-category-assignment-work-in-progress/"], [61, "2016-03-07T02:55:14Z", [0.18], ""], [405, "2016-03-07T02:27:54Z", [0.6], "- 5 passage of time"], [12874, "2016-03-07T02:08:40Z", [0.18], ""], [12874, "2016-03-07T02:07:04Z", [0.25], ""], [38, "2016-03-07T02:00:37Z", [0.77], "I've been forecasting 30% and I don't feel good about it.\n-Turkey & Russia aren't getting along at all.\n-The Russian economy is shot and this is an expensive project.\n-Turkey is distracted by refugee issues, the war in Syria, and internal tensions with Turkish Kurds\n-I have a hard time believing that this plant pencils out with the price of oil so low and not expected to go up dramatically for several years.

While one would have thought that after the Turkish strategic blunder (its difficult to characterise purposefully shooting down a Russian plane and killing their pilots as anything else) that Turkey would have taken a deep breath, stepped back and made some suitable nationalistic & diplomatic noises and called it a day... However that assumes a rational state actor (on both sides!) - and while both are bombastic nationalists, Puttin at at least a comprehendible state actor (in purely Russian & domestic terms) while Erdo\u011fan is appearing increasingly irrational, and perhaps isn't listening to advice..\nStiring up a Kurdish civil war (when peace seemed so close), clearly logistically, medically and financially trading/backing backing ISIS; he thought he could scare off the Russian air-strikes against his Turkmen[ISIS?] allies in Syria by shoot-down....Putin however took it very personally and things have escalated from there... So rather than backing down, Erdo\u011fan instead blockaded the Bosphorus to Russian shipping in December.\n'Blocking' [aka delaying] of Russian ships in the Bosphorus by Turkey (its good to remember that blockades of critical sea lanes have been seen as acts of war before..) is a significant upping of the ante - and if push comes to shove the space for miscalculation seems increasingly small...especially with two belligerent state actors with their perceived key strategic interests at stake.\nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/russia-turkey-crisis-27-russian-ships-blocked-after-moscow-detains-turkish-vessels-2231946 Similarly the next Russian move in response might even be as provocative as arming the Kurds with heavy weapons, and perhaps (less likely) shielding them from Turkish air-strikes... So in this tightened tension I find Russian continuing of constructing a nuclear reactor for what potentially (at least in Russian military planner's mind's now) must surely be a potential enemy would seem folly. Consequently I think it highly likely that the nuclear power plant project will be mothballed - at the very least until Turkish-Russian relationship soothes over significantly (and with things the way they are in Syria - with Russian plans bombing ISIS aligned Turkmen and oil-tankers in Syria that seems increasingly unlikely). One would hope that diplomats are pointing out to Turkey that NATO exists to protect them, not for a shield in the event of their triggering another Turko-Russian war...? (where its likely there would be much less sympathy in Europe for aiding Turkish backing ISIS in its proxy-war in Syria va Asad, Iran & Russia...) The (hopefully slim) prospect of Turkey agitating the situation with Russia to the point than an inadvertent shooting war is [inadvertently] triggered seems possible.\nIn the event of Turkey (even accidentally) shooting at Russian Bosphorus shipping, its easy to see how a proxy-war could quickly become something much worse...\n(And as we know from past Naval incidents - once combat systems are active the potential for false-positives and defensive/pre-emptive attacks becomes high; as unlike land conflict reaction times are measured in seconds).

I went through the training videos on the web site and one suggestion was in order to become a better forecaster you need to start forecasting so here I am. I also just read the book superforecasting and am now studying it to gain a greater appreciation for this skill. Below is my outside and inside view of the question. Broadly, projects get canceled more frequently and at a higher rate than I thought. When looking at the Akkuyu nuclear power plant I looked at both Russia and Turkey interests. Russia is facing financial troubles (list below). There are also recent examples (Bulgaria in 2012) and (Ukraine 2015) of canceled projects of Russian nuclear power projects. Taking into consideration that plants close, Russian plants have closed, Russia debt downgraded, Rubble in trouble, military conflict with Turkey, scientist training suspended\u2026 it looks like this plant could close. Now when will it close? We have 12 months for this to happen. I also acknowledge I\u2019m having trouble figuring out a timeline. But since we are in a new year we should expect 2-4 plants close up shop Akkuyu could be one. Outside view: There are 440 commercial nuclear power reactors in operation in the world and 65 under construction [1]. There are 180 abandoned, canceled, or unfinished nuclear power plants worldwide [2]. That is roughly 40% of nuclear power plants that don\u2019t ever make it. I can then broadly say if there is 65 plants under construction 40% of those (26) face possible canceling projects if the historical trend continues. I will acknowledge that these numbers are rough. I found another website that said 12% of power plants today are at risk of closing today [10]. I looked at all nuclear power plants in history versus newer projects. I suppose I could split the difference. The point is broadly from an outside view power plants projects stop construction. I looked for the greatest reasons for plants closing and the top three reasons relate to financing, design, and labor markets. I can continue further with \u201coutside view\u201d information but the aforementioned are the biggies. Inside view: \u201cThe Russian builders aren\u2019t doing well neither(sic),\u201d the authors write, \u201cIn February 2015, Moody\u2019s downgraded Atomenergoprom \u2014 100% subsidiary of Rosatom, as integrated nuclear group also building reactors it is comparable to the French AREVA \u2014 to \u201cjunk\u201d and assigned a \u2018negative outlook\u2019.

In addition, they said the construction work has been ongoing without pause, and that the construction of the project, whose contract was recently awarded to Cengiz Construction Company through a bidding process, is ongoing.\" So this play - issue an anonymous statement, deny it later - could be a warning to Russia: \"we think you may be thinking about cancelling the project or violating its schedule, and if so, we'll definitely make you pay.\" (2) I don't think Turkey is intent on cancelling on suspending this project (alternatively, they'd rather Russia/Rosatom cancel it themselves): http://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2015/12/09/turkey-not-dependent-on-russia-for-construction-of-nuke-plant-deputy-pm-kurtulmus-says\n\"Russia will not easily give up on the construction of Turkey's first nuclear project, Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Wednesday.\" http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-has-shelved-turkish-stream-gas-pipeline-project-says-president-erdogan.aspx?PageID=238&NID=92115&NewsCatID=348\n\u201cThere is no indication that the problems between us and Russia will be reflected to Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant project,\u201d Erdogan added at a meeting in Istanbul.\" (3) The project is owned by Russia, built by Russia (mostly; some $6-8 billion worth of construction work is supposed to be subcontracted to Turkish companies), and financed by Russia;\n\"The construction of the first unit will begin in 2016... the first unit is expected to be completed in 2020.\"\nhttp://www.akkunpp.com/akkuyu-nuclear-jsc\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkuyu_Nuclear_Power_Plant\nSo, cancelling this project, unlike tourism and food embargoes, won't put any immediate pressure on Turkey. On the other hand, Rosatom and its Russian subsidiaries/contractors involved in this project have mouths to feed. So if the Russian government or Rosatom can find cash or credit to finance the project, it will go on. (4) Well, can they? A couple of stories here. October 2015, before the Su-24 incident:\nhttp://www.np-cpp.ru/rus/news/branch_news/document6204.phtml\n\"For 2015 the subsidy for nuclear nuclear power plants construction in Russia was about 38 billion rubles, and another 50.1 billion rubles - for NPP \"Akkuyu\" in Turkey[;] for the next year, according to the three-year budget for 2015 and the planning period of 2016-2017, \"Rosatom\" was supposed to receive 37.3 billion rubles for construction of power plants in Russia.\nIn a draft budget for 2016 published by the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday the nuclear power plants construction subsidy is 26.682 billion rubles.\"\nSo, Russia's cutting subsidies for Rosatom for 2016, however, no word on Akkuyu construction subsidy. 1 December 2015:\nhttp://tass.ru/ekonomika/2489088\n\"The first deputy head of United Russia faction in the State Duma, a member of its Energy Committee Yury Lipatov said that the 2016 federal budget does not provide funds for the construction of Akkuyu, nuclear power plant in Turkey, in 2016.\n\"Money for Akkuyu is not provided for 2016,\" - said the United Russia, commenting on the proposal of one of the deputies, Vladimir Sysoev, a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, for the relevant committees of the State Duma to study the issue of freezing construction of the plant in the light of the fact that it's \"financed by the budget Russian Federation.\" This initiative was voted down.\n\"The situation is under Rosatom's control. In order not to lose the previously invested money, Rosatom requests not to publicly interfere in financial matters,\" Lipatov said.\nThe first deputy head of the Duma's United Russia faction also said that on this issue he had a conversation with the leadership of Rosatom. \"Currently, the legal entity in Turkey is engaged in obtaining official licenses for energy generation and nuclear power plant construction. The actual construction work has not yet begun,\" - he said.\" Four possible explanations, not all of them contradictory:\n(a) the Akkuyu subsidy is in the budget, but under a different line, which allows a Rosatom-friendly lawmaker to misdirect his populist comrades;\n(b) Russian government has already decided to cut off financing for the project, at least for 2016; if they want to drop the project altogether, they will probably make an announcement;\n(c) Rosatom has not given up yet and is looking for outside financing (Russian state banks, foreign investors);\n(d) the project has enough funds for 2016 (maybe the 2015 subsidy was supposed to finance the project throughout the next several years), so there's no need for a new federal budget subsidy. (5) Can Turkey deny the project those licenses (\"the legal entity in Turkey is engaged in obtaining official licenses for energy generation and nuclear power plant construction\")? Maybe, but why give Russia a pretext to pull out (and maybe even avoid penalties) if Russia's bankrolling the project? (6) I'm not even touching the whole viability issue. There is a report (in Russian) that suggest that the whole project is very risky for Rosatom, but I have no idea if the calculations are correct:\nhttp://www.proatom.ru/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3715\nand the author certainly doesn't like the current management of Rosatom:\nhttp://www.proatom.ru/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3672&mode=flat&order=1&thold=0 (7) Something to keep an eye on:\nhttp://www.akkunpp.com/akkuyu-npp-jsc-ankara\nIf there's procurement for 2016, then the project has some financing (even if the actual construction is postponed) and, therefore, is not suspended by Russia (although we may be going into the \"what is a catch\" territory here, again). (8) I have to confess that I feel that \"no\" should be the status quo here, but I see two reasons to start on the side of \"yes\":\n- it's not clear if the project is financed throughout 2016, so an announcement of suspension/cancellation may come early;\n- it's even less clear if the project will be financed for 2017, and if not, an announcement may come at some point in 2016."], [12729, "2015-12-10T09:18:51Z", [0.21], ""], [102, "2015-12-10T06:09:47Z", [0.67], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/10/a-super-long-picky-post/"], [53, "2015-12-10T05:48:18Z", [0.9], ""], [2, "2015-12-10T05:11:29Z", [0.85], ""], [2, "2015-12-10T05:00:19Z", [0.65], ""], [1646, "2015-12-10T04:59:38Z", [0.35], ""], [498, "2015-12-10T04:53:29Z", [0.27], "Woe is me!

Imports of Turkish agricultural products have been prohibited.  Such measures will hurt Turkey more than they will hurt Russia.  What about the Akkuyu project?   It's big and it has an unusual BOO structure (buy-own-operate).  It will be 100% Russian.  Turks trained in Russia will work there as employees.  The project cost is 20 billion.  Three billion have been spent.  Here's the problem:  the Russians will own something expensive, but it's in another country.  If the relationship turns hostile, Akkuyu could turn into a complete loss.  Then what?  Do you invade a NATO country and try to send out utility bills to the population?   This is a classic \"sunk cost\" problem.  The best idea is to put the project on hold.  Write off the 3 billion (at least for the moment).  Save the other 17.  Stall on paying any penalties.
