I was very wrong on this one. I need to go back to the drawing board.  My ideas were the following:  \n1) the conservative majority would instinctively be against this kind of ruling; \n2) they would have ample room to rule against Zarda by refusing to expand the definition of \"sex\"\n3) the crowd was on the wrong track because their opinion reflected a desired outcome rather than a probable outcome. In part I drew this conclusion because several very good forecasters who I respect had low estimates for this question as well.  So ... the first 2 of those ideas were clearly wrong, and not by a little bit. The third is untestable (at least in terms of the \"why\") but the bottom line doesn't lie: certainly the crowd was a lot more right than I was.  Lessons learned: \n1) it's often a good idea to err towards the crowd opinion especially in cases where I don't have a strong basis for my opinion myself\n2) I didn't research the question beyond reading comments and a couple of news articles. I should err on the side of tackling fewer questions and researching them more\n3) The ideas above aren't a methodical approach to answering the question and estimating a probability; but rather they are a \"story\" or scenario or hypothesis.

In 2010, Altitude Express fired Zarda. Zarda filed a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He then sued Altitude Express in federal court, alleging he was terminated for his sexual orientation and arguing the termination violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[2][3] In March 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted summary judgment to Altitude Express, holding \"Second Circuit precedent holds that Title VII does not protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation.\"[2][3] On appeal, Zarda petitioned the 2nd Circuit to revisit its interpretation of Title VII \"in order to hold that Title VII's prohibition on discrimination based on 'sex' encompasses discrimination based on 'sexual orientation.'\"[2] The 2nd Circuit, sitting en banc, vacated the district court's judgment on the Title VII claim and remanded the case for further proceedings. The 2nd Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment on all other claims.[3] Altitude Express petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. In its petition, Altitude Express wrote, \"Prior to the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, the Seventh Circuit was the lone appellate court to hold that sexual orientation is protected as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. See Hively, 853 F3d 339. These recent holdings are in conflict with every other Circuit that has addressed this issue.\"[4]\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964         See also: Civil Rights Act of 1964 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin in public places, employment and education.
