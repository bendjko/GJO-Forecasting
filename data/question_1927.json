According to Bloomberg [2] and WSJ [3], troop buildup from both sides on the border have reached historic highs this year, and tensions are great, meaning that any border skirmish could easily turn deadly.

My reason for the large change in perspective is that I recently thought about how China and nations in general tend to avoid direct conflict. More specifically, the CCP has been claiming the island of Taiwan as theirs for decades, though they have not taken any real military action. In the past few years, China has risen to become a country that could rival the United States in terms of military strength, and very well could take over Taiwan but they continue to hold back. I believe this to also be true for the conflicting borders with India; they want the land but really do not want to start a military conflict with a strong militarized nation. If China were to start a conflict within the next few months, I believe that it would be over Taiwan or the South China Sea, not the Himalayas. As a result, I believe that there would be a 0.5% chance of China wanting to participate in a real conflict with India, and a 1.5% chance of a lethal confrontation (1 death) occurring as an accident. Though, it was brought to my attention in last Thursday's lecture that India has sent 50,000 troops to this disputed border (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-27/india-shifts-50-000-troops-to-china-border-in-historic-defense-shift). Though this is an act of aggression from India, I do not believe that China will want to retaliate in a way that would cause conflict. As I mentioned earlier, China is more focused on claiming Taiwan and the South China Sea. Even with this in mind, this move from India should not be ignored with regard to this forecast as more troops creates more potential for accidents to happen. I raise my forecast on the chance of an accidental lethal confrontation from 1.5% to 2.5%, giving me a 3% total probability."], [101793, "2021-07-07T00:08:48Z", [0.01], ""], [62808, "2021-07-06T14:36:25Z", [0.02], ""], [98842, "2021-07-06T13:28:22Z", [0.09], ""], [101318, "2021-07-02T16:11:32Z", [0.01], "Given currently no additional news regarding rise in tension, and the shorter horizon left, I would say that my prediction is 0.5%.

The only reasonable place where this lethal confrontation could occur is on the China-India border, as it seems extremely unlikely that there would be an all out war that would draw in India and China somewhere else that arises within the next 5 months. Now let's look at the documented data from a reputable source: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/india-china-border-clashes.html. There was a clearly lethal war between India and China in 1962, a lethal conflict in 1967, and the lethal conflict in 2020. This is out of a history of the border since 1914, about 100 years. So the historical base rate seems to be about 3/100 = 3% per year, which yields a rate of 1.5% per half year (about 5 months). This isn't really fair to say however considering the India China border is over the Himalaya Mountains which are more usable in the summer months, and the bulk of summer/early fall in 2021 is yet to come and is before Dec 1 2021, so let's say that the historical base rate for this conflict occurring between July 1 (essentially) and Dec 1 of a given year is about 2/3 of the chance of the conflict of the entire year, so 2%. However, we also need to take the inside view after considering this base rate. As noted in my previous forecast, due to COVID 19 and various international relations, it seems that this event occurring in the next 5 months is less likely than the historical mean. China and India, in particular India, have more pressing concerns than border conflicts at the moment.

China in particular cannot afford more decline to its international reputation, with the aforementioned theory gaining popularity, and the general declining state of US-China relations in recent years over economic and political dominance, especially in 2020 with the COVID crisis and the Trump administration's response (https://www.cfr.org/article/how-2020-shaped-us-china-relations). Based on some of the causes of recent rise of violence against those of Asian descent in America, it is fair to say that this declining relationship exacerbated by COVID has yielded violent anti-China sentiment in a non-negligible subset of the American people -- this seems like a reasonable conclusion based on articles such as https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/05/26/the-politics-of-anti-asian-racism/. So among some Americans at least, there is the undercurrent of support of anti-China behavior, in particular military behavior. With the aggressive foreign policy stance of the Biden administration (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55945942) and its declining relationship and perception by Americans, China should and will avoid aggressive conflict with America, likely reflecting in the behavior of their troops along their border.

India will behave similarly with the pressing COVID crisis in their nation; such crises take months to resolve in large democratic nations as seen by the United States, and it is already early June. Not to mention, lethality in the India-China border is rare. Such tensions already boiled over last year, and it is a historically somewhat rare (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute). But this event has a positive probability of occurrence, with a lethal conflict having occurred already last year, and the current year is somewhat unprecedented in recent history with respect to this event with the rise of China's political power and the ramifications of the COVID-19 crisis. So I can say confidently that this event has, intuitively, less than a 5-6% chance of occurring.

So, if both nations continue to hold to their policy of avoiding the usage of weapons in the conflict, then there appears to be a low likelihood of a lethal confrontation even if more skirmishes occur between now and the beginning of December. The official statements by government officials in recent months also suggest that neither government wants any violent escalation, and with January's conflict not even being recorded in China's patrol log, these statements appear fairly genuine and consistent.

However, in February China did withdraw from Pangong Tso lake, which had been the stage to a few of the confrontations in the past year, and officials have clearly indicated their desire to settle things diplomatically rather than by force. So while there is still some strong tension along the LAC, attempts to de-escalate the situation along with increased military deterrent on both sides of the border make a confrontation with weapons unlikely, and a lethal one even more so. However continued militarization along the border does indicate that both sides feel the need to be prepared should more fights break out, and since complete de-escalation is far off, along with the fact that China has had a history of slowly encroaching upon the Indian border that I believe will continue in the future with probability approximately 0.85, a lethal confrontation is definitely possible with the increased tensions caused by the initial breakout in May 2020."], [101327, "2021-06-10T13:12:39Z", [0.01], "According to the linked US News article, the June 2020 incident was the first lethal confrontation in 45 years.

I'd suggest that the probability of a lethal clash taking place either in the SCS or the Galwan ALC are the two regions to consider. The questions I ask myself are;\na) what is the likelihood of an 'accident' happening that leads to the fatality?\nb) does China or India want provoke an incident with the other?\nWithin the time frame of this question and based on current information, I suggest a) is about a 20% probability. @SE_Meyer "], [22972, "2021-02-05T21:37:38Z", [0.0], "damage would be too big"], [62808, "2021-02-05T21:15:36Z", [0.05], ""], [81567, "2021-02-05T20:57:55Z", [0.2], ""], [13657, "2021-02-05T20:47:08Z", [0.1], ""], [74903, "2021-02-05T19:55:26Z", [0.15], ""], [98108, "2021-02-05T19:40:19Z", [0.15], "Both countries are continuing to send troops to the border increasing the risk of a lethal confrontation. However, since June the skirmishes have been non-lethal and local commanders have sought to deescalate. The only lethal confrontations at the border between India and China have occurred in 1975 and June 2020 indicating another such incident is unlikely. There remains the remote chance of a lethal confrontation elsewhere between India and China that also needs to be considered. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/25/world/asia/india-china-border.html\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484"], [1333, "2021-02-05T19:35:55Z", [0.0], ""], [94737, "2021-02-05T19:11:27Z", [0.3], ""], [88452, "2021-02-05T18:17:50Z", [0.2], ""]]}
