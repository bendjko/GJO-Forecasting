The proposition that this year would be the year because it is when Democratic power in government is strongest before 2022 elections, in which the Democratic Party could lose seats and thus power in confirming a Breyer replacement, would thereby in hindsight be noise in judgement. With just 2 months or so until the start of the next term, I would not see it as polite or practical to retire now and have very little time to have a process to confirm a new Justice. Breyer is an individual who is amiable to other members of the court, so if he does in fact step down now, it would lead to many undesirable 4-4 decisions in the next term until Congress can hustle in a new Justice. If anyone would hate 4-4 decisions it would be Breyer who preaches that the court mostly agrees unanimously in comparison to split decisions, this in the hope of persuading the public that the court is not a politicized institution. Breyer is also known as a pragmatic Justice. Stepping down now would lead to impractical haste and political involvement not consistent with Breyer's practical and independent nature. There is also a big abortion case next term which could overturn or uphold Roe v. Wade. If the \"liberal\" Justices can form a majority opinion for the court, Breyer would probably have the power to choose who authors the opinion, since he is PROBABLY the most senior Justice that will be in such a \"liberal\" majority.

The fact is that Breyer has been emphatic that justices should renounce any allegiance to the political leaning of those who nominated them as justices. Moreover, he has stated that only two things matter to him with respect to retiring: his health and the current court. The final fact is that there is tremendous pressure on him to retire from the members of the party that nominated him. \nTo the best of our knowledge (a HUGE caveat) he has no health problem (that\u2019s 20% of my projection\u2014 allowing for a condition he hasn\u2019t disclosed). Given the \u201cstate of the court\u201d (his second consideration), with him in the senior liberal role, and therefore a pivotal influence, he is likely inclined to remain. \nBut, the biggest issue likely causing conflict is the pressure he\u2019s getting. To be internally consistent with his own words, he needs to remain immune to that pressure. Because he is human, he is probably also uncomfortable with the implication that he should bend to anyone\u2019s will \u2014 especially those who want him to defy his own belief in a non-political court. Based on those facts, I think that his retirement would be likely only if:\n1) There is a health condition we don\u2019t know about (20%). That doesn\u2019t seem an unreasonable possibility given his age and the life expectancy of highly educated American, white men (~79); or\n2) If he can resolve the internal dissonance of seeming to accede to the political pressure of liberals. Given what we know of his principles, that seems unlikely. But given what we know of his legal opinions, not impossible. (15%). I\u2019m not sure if I am supposed to provide research sources. I haven\u2019t. But they are not obscure. His interview on 7/2021 that was reported on by every media outlet is one source. His legal opinions are another.
