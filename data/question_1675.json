I'm a bit wary of this question, as while there's market fluctuations and market-moving data publications every day, next week the 30th September will see the publication of:\n- ADP National Employment Survey (not the official survey but used to complement it),\n- quarterly GDP SAAR (statistical estimates ahead of the official GDP announcements)\n- monthly Home Sales data, and a few less important regional data publications like Chicago PMI etc Meaning that deadline day itself will possibly see sudden decisive shifts depending on the data. My initial expectation from the broad market trends over the last three months is that it will finish somewhere in the lower three buckets, so I have rated the top two as 0%.   This is no different from the crowd consensus so seems safe enough call to make, especially as I haven't got much at stake with it being the final week before the deadline. There's an outlier chance that it will finish up 15%, if there are wild figures or some other major market boost in the next week but I do not really expect this.  15% up on 30 June is 3,566.33       While yes, *{past performance is no guarantee of future returns}*  etc, it has only closed above +15% on a single day since this question opened (2 Sep: 3580.84), so I am rating this as 0%. The real test seems to be which side of the \"5% up\" it will finish (below or above 3255.30).   It has consistently closed above this since 31 July, and even with Monday 21 Sep's big market wobble it still closed 3281.06.  However it does keep bumping around the +6-7% mark and it wouldn't take that much to knock down to +4.9% or below. A lot depends on the market-moving-data next week, which I don't have any special insight into.   A quick skim of the labour data shows that recovery has been slower than expected but is still making progress.   Excluding any retrospective revisions (which won't take place before 30 Sep anyway) it seems like the only way for GDP to go is up, now that they're rebounding from such a crater, so my basic assumption is that GDP SAAR will be not not great but not terrible.   Barring any other market-moving news (like one of the vaccine trials being suspended) then I suspect it's most likely to stay above +5%. Additionally, with there only being 7 days left, to extract what little brier points I can at this late stage, I'm going to to extremise my forecasts beyond the real balance of probabilities I would actually predict* if I'd been forecasting in this question from the beginning, so I'm putting all my chips on a +5 to +15 finish. *probably like 89% on +5 to +15; and 11% on -5 to +4.9"], [95444, "2020-09-23T06:47:21Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [34959, "2020-09-23T04:42:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.84, 0.01], ""], [13306, "2020-09-23T03:12:14Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [84880, "2020-09-23T01:27:05Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.19, 0.81, 0.0], ""], [28153, "2020-09-23T00:31:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.0], ""], [57778, "2020-09-23T00:30:22Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.14, 0.84, 0.01], ""], [87880, "2020-09-22T21:23:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.19, 0.81, 0.0], ""], [4962, "2020-09-22T21:03:47Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.42, 0.58, 0.0], ""], [92458, "2020-09-22T20:36:39Z", [0.01, 0.09, 0.69, 0.2, 0.01], ""], [53391, "2020-09-22T19:53:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2020-09-22T19:52:15Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.65, 0.0], "Currently at 3318, up 7%. -15% to down/up 5, +15 to up 5-15."], [20284, "2020-09-22T19:29:06Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [88010, "2020-09-22T19:25:34Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.05, 0.9, 0.03], ""], [90167, "2020-09-22T19:06:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.85, 0.05], ""], [31251, "2020-09-22T17:21:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.84, 0.04], ""], [94435, "2020-09-22T17:19:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85, 0.0], ""], [691, "2020-09-22T14:33:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.16, 0.84, 0.0], ""], [86785, "2020-09-22T14:31:19Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.7, 0.1], ""], [28153, "2020-09-22T14:30:31Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.45, 0.55, 0.0], ""], [27321, "2020-09-22T14:26:24Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [95223, "2020-09-22T13:43:04Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.82, 0.08, 0.01], "Calculated the base rate for fluctuations of +-5% and +-10% from a month's start to end from 11-1-2010 to 8-31-2020 to arrive at these numbers.

I am, however, very reluctant to assign a significantly larger probability to the index being at 3566 or higher on September 30th for a couple of reasons. #1: A steadily rising market crushes volatility. Example: if a S&P500 call option has 1 month to go, the index is at 3450 and the strike price of the call at 3550, the option should cost $77 with 30% implied volatility, but only $8.50 with 10% implied volatility. As options get cheaper, more people can afford options, which makes them likely to buy dips and sell rallies, depressing volatility even further.\n#2: What goes up must come down. In many ways, the current rally is the result of overly cautious positioning, fund managers keeping \"powder dry\" in expectation of perky prices catching up with bad fundamentals. As their bets turn out wrong, they are forced to buy stocks in order to keep their job. Once this game is over, there is usually a big correction, as happened in similar market circumstances in Q1'2018 or June this year.\n#3: Frontloading of good news. Previously, stock splits like the ones for AAPL and TSLA have historically been bullish for these stocks, and so have Fed meetings. With the splits out of the way on Aug 31st and FOMC on September 18th, fear of October and Q4 earnings, and unusually high momentum (S&P500 index minus say the 200 day or 100 day moving average)  are quite likely to be headwinds.

Therefore I discount any scenario of less than 3,100 to 0%. I could distribute something like a total of 10% to all the lower than June 30th brackets, but I will take the bullish approach that in pre-election US, the government will do everything in its powers to maintain stability and positivity in the financial markets. So, 3,100 is my low bookend.\n- At the same time, if the current upwards trend keeps up at exactly the same pace until end of September, its projection is at about 3,708. This is my high bookend. So my intuitive evaluation on the remaining \"plausible brackets\" is:\n- Between down less than 5% and up less than 5% (which covers my butt for any small decline too, which is good). This bracket will materialize when S&P is between 2,945 and 3,255. If today's 3,351 corrects down to below 3,255, you got this. Its possible (with elections, covid, china and all) so I will give it 40%.\n- Up between 5% and 15% inclusive: thisis the scenario of the current positive trend keeping up for a while and stabilizing shortly after, but not falling back. In absolute terms, that is between 3,255 and 3,565. Highly possible. Currently we are within this bracket. No major shocks until Sept 30 and and you are here. I give it 50%.\n- Up more than 15%: this is a scenario of continued, undisrupted increase to above 3,565. Only small chance of exceeding that and maintaining that by Sept 30th, but given that current trend takes us to this by Sept 10th or so, then it is still possible. Lack of negative news can bring it there. I give it a 10%. Now, I'm not satisfied with intuition and I am using a simplified mathematical approach: I am fitting the distribution of outcomes of Sept 30th into a Normal Distribution (it is not really, I would better choose a Random Walk model, where every day the S&P can go up or down by a maximum % but I don't have the time for that).\n- So, I'm using today's value of 3,351 as the average/mean\n- It can move up or down every day, with equal probability (also wrong, I believe there may be an upwards skew towards higher S&P values driven by a pre-election boost but whatever).\n- The rate of increase from 3,100 on June 30, to 3,351 today is 6.605 per day.\n- Reduction of 6.605 per day till Sept 30 means a low (P90) of equal to 2,995.\n- Continued increase by 6.605 per day till Sept 30 means a high (P10) of equal to 3,707.\n- For a Normal Distribution with Mean = 3,351, P10 = 3,707 and P90 = 2,995, the Standard Deviation is 274.\n- This way I've created a Normal Distribution where the cumulative probability of 2,945<x<3,255 is ~28%. Let's say 30%.\n- Likewise, the cumulative probability of 3,255<x<3,565 is something between 41-46%. Let's say 45%.\n- Likewise, the cumulative probability of x>3,565 is ~23%. Let's say 25%. So, I've got two sets of predictions (always referring to the 3 uppermost brackets):\n- The \"intuition-based\" one: 40-50-10%.\n- The \"Normal Distribution\" one: 30-45-25%.\n- They are different because my intuition includes more chance of \"a downside correction\", while the Normal Distribution assumes symmetrical movement. Now I have to combine. For me, the elections is a major influencer here on this. In every pre-election period, where I can track S&P, steady increase was observed, with exception the 2000 and the 2008 where two major crashes occured (Dot-Com bubble burst, and Lehman bankruptcy), all other election years saw steady increases in pre-election (that's what the incumbent presidents strive for in pre-election). This year, the crash has already happened. So, I believe in the steady increase scenario more than the decline scenario. So, finally:\n- Low bracket -5% <  x < +5% : 25% chance\n- Mid bracket +5% < x < +15%: 45% chance\n- High bracket x > +15%: 30% chance I know it's a long argumentation and my thought process evolved as I was writing this, but hey - this is about predicting the S&P 500, if I could simply predict that, I would be a psychic!

On the fiscal support front, the CARES Act did a lot to support incomes (PPP, expanded UI, ERTC, etc.). So much so that Employee Compensation plus UI benefits has actually increased (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-26/yes-that-extra-600-really-is-making-up-for-lost-u-s-income). This is set to go away in at the end of July and it remains to be seen how if it will be extended. That is a big risk to consumers. On the health assumptions front. I think a broad national lockdown in the U.S. is less likely, but regional lockdowns in response to flair-ups will continue. How severe they are will depend on our ability to effectively track and trace (which right now is low). A vaccine or therapy would be a huge upside, but I'm bearish on getting that this year, let alone this quarter. There are 84 combination of those 3 factors (Fed, Fiscal, Virus at positive, neutral, or negative relative to the current environment) - a few too many to assign specific values to each. My base case is that:\n- Fiscal policy will remain supportive - deep down Trump knows he needs to support incomes to have a chance at winning. The Republican party will thus fall in line. Expect another $1tn+ package.\n- Monetary policy will also remain supportive, but I don't have a ton of certainty here around what the balance sheet will do\n- I expect the virus to continue surging in isolated pockets of the country - these lockdowns could spark a correction if they are wide-spread All of this is a very long way of saying I don't have a ton of confidence here. I guess I'll force myself to choose and say that my base-case is a \"2020 collar\" - that's the combination of a long Powell/Trump put and a short COVID call. In other words, any reopening that pushes the market ahead will be held in check by a rise in cases that prompts more lockdowns. A large fall in the market will be offset by accommodative fiscal/monetary policy.

The longer Biden maintains a lead in the polls, the more tampered enthusiasm will be for the stock market. Trump has not demonstrated any potential for reversing course through strong leadership, instead choosing to focus on potentially flawed unemployment counts. He currently has an implied 33% chance of re-election. This increases the odds that the market will trade sideways and remains between -5% and +5% until a clearer election story emerges. 2) The stock market is historically overvalued. When the Shiller PE is this high, the implied future annual return is 3.4%. But since that's annual, over three months in a model-fitting world, we might expect a gain of slightly under 1%. If this were the entire story, we'd assign a high probability that the market would remain flat, but because the 3.4% is annualized, what often happens within the first few years of a high Shiller PE is the market drops significantly (as we saw in March) only to slowly regain over the course of several additional years. The 3.4% is therefore averaged and over the short term could potentially be much shorter. Thus, this significantly increases the odds of a flat or down market over the next three months. 3) Enhanced unemployment payments has significantly increased the amount of spending Americans are able to do. This will run out at the end of July and we will have a better picture of how much discretionary funds consumers actually have to spend. Additionally, despite the Unemployment payments, many are unable to pay rent or housing payments. Around 20% to 33% of renters have been unable or unwilling to pay rent in the previously three months, and according to CNBC 30% of people missed housing payments in June. If these are the numbers when Americans are receiving stimulus money and enhanced unemployment benefits, we can expect the potential for a significant increase in those numbers once benefits run out. 4) Tied into #3, a lot of emphasis has been placed on how well the economy is bouncing back based on Non Farm Payroll increases in May and June. However, the caveat there is that the Labor Bureau has admitted that they are often misclassifying many people as employed when that's not necessarily the case. Anecdotally, I know of many people who have been told by their bosses that they have a job until the PPP money runs out and that those companies will be out of business. While I don't place much weight on anecdotal evidence, in May we saw the largest number of bankruptcies since 2009, so the anecdotal evidence seems to line up with incoming economic data. Additionally, Yelp and Open Table have both presented hugely negative views on permanent business closures. Open Table estimated that more than 25% of restaurants will not survive this. Yelp has announced that 41% of business listings are now classified as permanently closed. This data does not reflect the optimism over reopening, and heavily weights the odds of the market heading into negative territory. 5) Despite all of this negative news, the market seems intent on rising. Analysts continue to dismiss bad news, telling investors to focus on future earnings several years down the road. If the market is able to maintain such a forward thinking attitude, it's possible that the market will manage to rise further or at the very least hold onto positive returns until closer to the election. 6) Lastly, (aside from potentials that are harder to put numbers on: the tensions between India and China, the situation in HK, etc) the Fed so far has been able to buoy markets with the injections of liquidity. They're in a weird spot at the moment, because with the \"record setting\" non farm payroll numbers, Congress will be discouraged from providing too much more stimulus which will limit the Fed's actions. They actually need bad news to do more, the balance of which would likely end up some what of a wash as their actions have had diminishing returns since the shut down began. For now they will likely wait to see what happens when PPP and Unemployment benefits run out as well as what will happen with delayed reopenings, but should the situation decline more than anticipated in August, and should the market start waking up to the reality of the economy with the next earnings reports, expect the Fed to step in. They've been making announcements when the market declines as little as 1%, so they seem fearful of letting it drop too much at once and would try to avoid a drop of more than 10%, but the potential that their tools begin to lose efficacy cannot be ruled out.
