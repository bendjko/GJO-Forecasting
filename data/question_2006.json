Still a low outside rate, but I think I was underestimating the size of the effect from the delta variant surge in past forecasts to justify a higher 50-55% probability (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1307905).  The daily numbers in the curve that they're showing are an average over a fairly long time period, it's an average of polynomial regressions over 10, 20, and 30 days. I'd noted previously we haven't seen much of an effect from the delta variant, but that may be because it's still weighting polls from up to a month ago. We have 10 days left, which will means we'll cycle out the polls from July 4 - July 14 and add in a new set of current polls. We'll both add new less favorable polls, and remove old more favorable polls, which should extend the downward trend, even if nothing changes with the actual population-level approval rate in the next week and a half. That said, it's very easy to see from the historical data that dips like the current one don't always last. Seemingly random jumps out of nowhere aren't uncommon. We may be at a local minimum which we'll regress back to the mean from, a pattern we've seen countless times for this curve. It'll come down to what polls come out when, and how the FiveThirtyEight bias adjuster changes them and polynomial smoother treats them, which is fairly opaque. We're at the lowest level ever and still have 0.9% to fall, probably more if we regress to the mean, which is pretty far in this context.  Lastly, it's not even clear that his approval rating has dropped enough recently, despite the curve results. Looking at polls since July 27, they still skew towards above 50% (look at each poll's difference from 50% times its weight). Instead the dip could be from the phasing out of polls from late June, which appear more favorable than recent polls, even if the trend over the past couple weeks has been minimal. The curve will probably continue to fall, but it's a question of degree and timing.

Something needs to change (or keep changing) for it to go below 50%. Approval did dip recently to around 52% (as low as 51.5%) though, so that may be the start of something. Outside rate here is probably 12% or so for below 50%, just due to ambiguity about the recent dip and chance of more change in the future. Getting an outside rate here is pretty difficult since the polling method used here only applies to like 3 presidents, and Biden hasn't been in office very long either. I've soured on the idea of analyzing much of Biden at a high level, this is down to the opinions of 1.5% or so of respondents and whether they'll change their minds. It's difficult to study that group directly obviously, but the closest group is probably voters in swing states and independents, especially considering the wide gap between Democrats and Republicans in approval (https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/05/presidents-approval-ratings-are-now-all-about-partisanship.html) which likely indicate a high degree of inflexibility in those groups.  For independent voters, their main reasons for support seem to have been Biden not being Trump and him bringing stability to the COVID pandemic. I do expect Biden to continue not being Trump, very confident there. The key variable there may actually be the delta variant and resurgence in COVID. If we go back to lockdowns or if COVID spreads rapidly in the US like it recently has in the UK, that may compromise their support. We've already seen an uptick in national cases and I fully expect that to continue, even if it doesn't lead to hospitalizations or deaths.

Polls are noisy and fluctuate a fair bit, his honeymoon period may wear off with some groups, and economic performance in the near future may do better or worse than current expectations. His approval rating has been pretty stable so far, average daily change is -0.007%, with a SD of 0.76% and a level >=55% on 1 of 119 days. No guarantee that will persist though, like Obama dropped 9% over 80 days (day ~140 to ~220) from 60% to 51%, with the main themes around that drop seeming to be the \"discourse\" around the ACA, as well as over a longer timespan the novelty of the presidency wearing off and the bad economy post-recession. Trump fell about 7% from his start but that was harder to pinpoint why, probably a combination of failed healthcare reform, the Russia investigation, Charlottesville, etc.  As for outside rate factors, approval ratings do tend to fall after a \"honeymoon period\" when a President takes office, so that doesn't bode well. Quantifying that individual effect is super hard though, since we don't have good poll data going back more than 4 administrations or so. However, approval ratings are also strongly tied to the economy, and most people are expecting a strong economic recovery as we go into the summer post-COVID with vaccines rolling out and \"pent up demand\" for basically everything. There's almost 0 trend in his approval ratings over time since taking office too, but the same can mostly be said for Obama as well (though not Trump), so it may not be a great marker. Overall, the economy is expected to do well so meeting expectations may have less impact than the post-election high wearing off for some group, net effect is probably a small decrease of 1.5% or so to ~52%. As for Biden specifically, he feels far less controversial than either Obama or Trump. Obama wanted to tackle healthcare in America after the Great Recession, and Trump had no shortage of controversies. Neither of them had a recipe for steady high approval. Biden on the other hand is focusing on COVID stimulus and infrastructure, and while there's disagreement about how to do them as always, those issues as a whole are about as uncontroversial as you can get. The main points of opposition are around the economy overheating and inflation and corporate taxes, but his plans have been out for months and approval ratings have trended nowhere.  Main case for above 55 is strong economic recovery as we come out of COVID boosting approval ratings, with another being the American Families Plan or American Jobs Plan being passed without anything blowing up, though I'd expect negotiations to take longer. Considering the noise in polling (SD of 0.76) it wouldn't take much increase in baseline approval rating for there to be a good chance of 55+. Main cases for below 50 are honeymoon period wearing off and a group (especially the AOC/Bernie crowd) supporting him less, or economic issues such as a weaker than expected recovery (recent jobs report is worrying), or an off-chance of inflation-related issues if increases are persistent and concentrated in goods people actually buy instead of things like used cars.

Only 2 of the past 6 presidents saw increases - so I would weigh the lower end heavier. maybe 3/5ths. So will the president be able to garner positive approval from his perceived impact on COVID-19 in the US. So far they have, so lets give them a +5% Will a stimulus package get passed? If yes that likely will garner positive approval, so lets give a +5 if passes (currently congress appears stuck) +0% Will there be an positive approval impact from not being Trump? I think this is actually a component of the current stability in the approval figure. +5% for status quo (50-55)  box. If unemployment benefits lapse and unemployment increases - I would expect a decrease in approval rating. -5% Apologies for this random stream of thought - "], [100923, "2021-05-14T22:48:33Z", [0.04, 0.26, 0.55, 0.15], ""], [95503, "2021-05-14T22:41:06Z", [0.04, 0.17, 0.55, 0.24], ""], [22689, "2021-05-14T20:53:07Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.9, 0.05], ""], [38, "2021-05-14T20:07:33Z", [0.02, 0.08, 0.78, 0.12], ""], [8826, "2021-05-14T19:36:21Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [94737, "2021-05-14T19:05:12Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [95503, "2021-05-14T18:30:08Z", [0.04, 0.23, 0.43, 0.3], ""], [99780, "2021-05-14T18:28:34Z", [0.02, 0.13, 0.47, 0.38], "Projecting forward the status quo, the economy will keep growing and people will be back largely to normal life.
