Congress has not passed a law explicitly authorizing face recognition for law enforcement use that clearly dictates what safeguards must be in place. Yet, federal agencies, including the FBI, have continued to expand the use of face recognition without safeguards. The FBI has access to over 640 million photos for face matching, including the driver\u2019s license databases of 20 states and passport application photos, has performed hundreds of thousands of face recognition searches, and is now reportedly piloting new uses of the technology. Despite this, the agency appears to be skirting even its most basic obligation to provide notice to individuals who have thistechnology used against them. Congressmust take action to prevent the harms associated with face recognition and other invasive and discriminatory surveillance technologies. Thus, it should pass legislation like the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act of 2020 that will halt the use of face recognition technology and prohibit use of funding for such technology. In addition, it should stop continued investment and funding in discriminatory and invasive technologies, like face recognition.\"\nhttps://epic.org/privacy/facerecognition/FRT-Moratorium-and-Divestment-Coalition-Letter-July2020.pdf Artificial stupidity. https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4084"], [93028, "2021-04-11T08:07:53Z", [0.0], ""], [45594, "2021-04-11T07:22:49Z", [0.05], ""], [92079, "2021-04-11T01:23:24Z", [0.0], ""], [60695, "2021-04-10T13:28:21Z", [0.0], ""], [53391, "2021-04-10T11:55:13Z", [0.0], "Sounds like another presidential commission is needed to review this topic.
