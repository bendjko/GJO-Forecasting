STI appears to be the most unlikely to perform the best between 01/10/2019, despite its performance in the past six months it has not shown recent growth, nor long term growth to the same level as other indexes.\nKOSPI has the best performance over five years, but has been slow in recent months.\nTWSE, by a slight margin has the best performance since 01/10/2019, but has been the third best performer over the longer terms.\nHSI finishes on top in the two most recent terms and is the only index to see growth over the past six months, but is a distance behind the KOSPI over the past five years. I believe that the HSI will be the best performer baring any major market shift, if there is a significant shakeup the STI may be the best performer despite its lack of growth it has been the most level index over five years.

I generated distributions for the daily % movements in each index (using their historical averages and standard deviation) and used these distributions to construct random walks (assuming normal distributions) for each index from now (using latest closing prices) to 28 June. I repeated these random walks 10,000 times using Monte Carlo. I then compare the resulting index levels on 28 June to the starting ones from 10 January, and extract the best performing index. This provides 10,000 simulations of the best performer. The final step is to calculate frequencies of being best for each index out of these 10,000 simulated outcomes. Results: 35, 10, 36, 19 Also noting that if I just take all 6-month periods between now and March 2011 and check best performer base rates these are: 35, 19, 19, 27. This method, while interesting for curiosity sake is not ideal here because the question is asking how the indexes will perform relative to a specific date in the past. Still, interesting differences for KOSPI and TWI. Inside View:  I will address this in the future.
