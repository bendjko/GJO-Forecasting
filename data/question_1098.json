While the blackface scandal had a seemingly measurable effect based on the changes in polling after public reporting, trend lines seem to indicate that this was more of a temporary effect, with polling numbers regressing back to the 20-25 point margins that have held consistent since the election was announced.  Demographics play an key role in the eventual outcome of the  election.

The latest Nanos Poll indicates that the Lib are regaining the lead over the Con [1].  Indeed, if you look at the polling trend [2], the polls for the Lib are gaining in the last two weeks [2].   According to Nanos, the recent shifting of the trend is essentially driven by the women voters who are increasingly concerned about the consequences on women issues in a Con government.   While the latest Monte Carlos simulations reported in the CBC's poll tracker still show a 53% versus 47% chance for a Con government, but the rising trend for the Lib is in evidence (58% versus 42% for a Con government in April) [2].   In view of the historical rapid change in the polls close to the election [3, 4], I am sticking to the 10% rise for the Lib at the end.  So my forecast is 47+10=57%.

Finally the leadership polls have Trudeau (Lib) leading slightly over Scheer (Con), 34% versus 31%, instead of leading by more than 10% earlier [1].  However, Singh (NDP) has only 21%.  The Wilson-Raybould scandal is finally stablized.  It looks like Trudeau is not going to resign.  Since NDP has no chance of winning the election.  At the end of the day, those NDP voters who do not want a Con government will, once again, vote for the Lib (holding their nose, maybe).  I give that a 10 percentage point from historical data.

First of all, Trudeau is the leader of one of the four major political parties. At first, it seems like they all have an equal chance to win the majority/plurality in parliament. However, for the last two decades, Canadian parliament has been dominated by leftist parties, especially the Liberal Party of Canada. Even with the rise of nationalism globally, it is not likely to have much of an effect in Canada. Trudeau continues to be poplar among Canadian citizens, in part due to the legacy of his father, but mostly due to his leadership and coordination during the last couple of years, especially in areas such as climate change and cyber security. If this were the end of it, my probability would be much lower. However, recently there has been a major scandal among the Canadian political elites. One news sources cites that \"57 percent of Canadians have had their view of Mr. Trudeau tainted by the crisis while 59 percent added the affair will impact who they will vote for in the federal election.\" If these numbers are to be believed, then Mr. Trudeau could possibly has some trouble in the upcoming election. Even with this scandal, I still believe that Trudeau will remain in office. His party may not obtain a majority, but I believe that they will retain the plurality.

The forecast probability for a Conservative majority and minority government is 22.4% and 27.2%, respectively, yielding a total of 49.6% (compared to a mere 33% a month earlier) [2]. Interestingly the \u201cleadership\u201d polls for Trudeau did not change much [1].  He is still consistently ahead of the Conservative leader by 10 to 20 percentage points, and also ahead of the NDP leader (by more than 20 percentage points).  This popularity will help him in the crossover vote described in the next paragraph. Since the Liberals and NDP are both left of center parties, there will be crossover votes from the NDP to the Liberals since NDP has no chance of getting the plurality of the votes in this coming election.  This crossover happens frequently near the end of the campaigning. I estimate a 10% crossover votes. This number is estimated based on the NDP crossover to the Liberal in the 2015 election [3], and the Liberal crossover to NDP in the 2011 election [4]. I subtract 10% from the 50% to account for the end of campaigning crossover.

Some of these data can be found in Wikipedia [1] and [2].  The polls for the upcoming election can be found here [3].  Examining these data suggests that there were frequent drastic shifts in the support for the parties in the last couple of months before the election.  Therefore using the current poll results for forecasting the election results could be way off. To it as it may, currently the Federal average supports for the Liberals and Conservatives are within the margin of error (37 versus 35%, respectively).  CBC performed Monte Carlo simulations to predict the outcome of the election, using the current poll results.  (Thanks to @nigster for providing the link [4]).  The forecast probability for a Conservative majority and minority government is 16% and 17%. respectively, yielding a total of 33%.   Since the Liberals and NDP are both left of center parties, there will be crossover votes from the NDP to the Liberals since NDP has no chance of getting the plurality of the votes.  This happens frequently near the end of the campaigning.  I estimate a 10% crossover votes.  This number is estimated based on the NDP crossover to the Liberal in the 2015 election [1], and the Liberal crossover to NDP in the 2011 election [2].

Of the three parties, the NDP (primarily socialist) have already crashed and burned with their current leader so unless they get a new leader they will barely register. The Conservatives (think ever so slightly right of centre) are led by a career politician unable to get his point across without speaking like the politician he is...meaning limited connection to people (so far). That leaves Trudeau and Liberals (ever so slightly left of centre). Canadians don\u2019t like too much change.
