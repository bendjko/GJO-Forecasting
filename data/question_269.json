It is clear that a deal must be made to rebalance the market, but given the current political situation (e.g. possible impact Trump could have on Iran with sanctions) - some countries will be looking to focus on what is more beneficial to them rather than as a global market. \nThe important thing to remember is the DME Oman Crude oil futures contract trading closes 1630 Singapore time (0930 in Austria).

DME Oman publication also reported increased activity at \u2018teapot\u2019 refineries which also adds to the demand\n           Oil markets supported by fuel for heating in the winter (OPEC MOMR October 16) - Worth keeping an eye on long-term weather forecasts throughout November to get a general idea of how much temperatures will drop in the coming winter.  According to OPEC MOMR October\u201916 issue Oman production will increase by 20tb/d. There are also a number of oil fields starting/resuming production in the 4Q and at the start of next year namely; Russia; Vostochno-Messoyakhskoye field, Launch of Suzunskoye field (which was supposedly in October) and Filanovsky filed in the Caspian sea (also supposed to be in October), Kashagan Field - Kazakhstan and Goliat - Norway.\n         There were also media reports indicating that Yemen resumed oil production in August of this year - since the civil war began more than 18 months ago. \n         Non-OPEC oil supply is also expected to rise due to oil sands production (which was shut down due to wildfires in Alberta), continued rise in US oil rig counts and end of seasonal maintenance.            OPEC had stated in a meeting in Algiers (28th September 2016) that they would plan to freeze oil production in order to rebalance the market - an article from DME (dated 12 October 2016) said since this agreement was made, and comments from Vladimir Putin agreeing to such a deal, caused DME Oman crude to increase 17% since late September. \n          The OPEC meeting on November 30th is where the deal will officially be agreed. However, many analysts say OPEC won\u2019t make a deal in November (Capitol Crude: \u201cPost-Algiers Prospects: what\u2019s really at stake when OPEC meets again in November\u201d Podcast). A news article on CNBC stated that OPEC has been producing at record highs, making investors skeptical of its target at cutting productions\n         According to CNN Money, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States are the worlds top oil producers of 2016. However, neither Russia nor the US are members of OPEC. Putin has agreed that Russia would partake in a deal to cut production - but with 3 new projects coming online in Russia, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that they will uphold an agreement to such a deal.  OPEC crude oil production increased in September with the main output increases coming from Iraq, Nigeria and Libya. Worth noting that Libya and Nigeria are expected to receive special conditions from the OPEC deal, along with Iran. \n         News article (platts.com) quoted as saying \u201cIraqi officials now want a higher allocation within any OPEC production deal or else will seek exemption, claiming revenue is needed to battle Islamic State militants\u201d  Oil demand expected to grow based on the assumption of rising vehicle sales in US, China and India, and demand for petrochemical feedstocks There are also global political issues to focus on within the next month that could have big impacts of the price of crude oil: USA Presidential elections, increasing political tensions between Russia and the West, fight against ISIS, impacts from Brexit\u2026 Crude prices rose in August partly due to the weakness of the US dollar. However, US Feds have said it is possible that interest rates will increase in December which will bring down the price/barrel of oil \nThe December-loading Oman futures contract settled at $50.23/b (breaking the $50 mark for the first time in 12 months). Given the price rise that occurred when OPEC announced it would make a deal to freeze production, it is possible that the oil price will increase after their meeting, however given the number of political issues that will affect oil prices right now it seems the price for November will be just marginally above $50 or marginally below $50.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 a barrel.\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/24/oil-prices-dip-on-opec-squabbles-ahead-of-planned-production-cut.html OQF17 (Jan '17) \t47.72s \nhttp://www.barchart.com/commodityfutures/DME_Crude_Oil_Oman_Futures/OQ http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/crude-oil/1-week/ "], [29074, "2016-10-27T01:27:14Z", [0.05, 0.51, 0.41, 0.03], ""], [368, "2016-10-26T21:49:08Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [28414, "2016-10-26T21:14:07Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [29763, "2016-10-26T18:35:31Z", [0.18, 0.34, 0.32, 0.16], ""], [691, "2016-10-26T12:16:32Z", [0.02, 0.72, 0.26, 0.0], ""], [241, "2016-10-26T11:00:19Z", [0.02, 0.6, 0.35, 0.03], ""], [15621, "2016-10-26T08:19:00Z", [0.0, 0.54, 0.45, 0.01], "http://dubaimerc.com/uploads/dme_historical_data/09092016_DME_Exchange_Products.pdf\n$45.11  9 Sept\n$43.17 16 Sept\n$49.05  5th Oct\n$49.34 21st Oct\n$48.35 25th Oct\nPrice falling slightly, so going a lower to reflect this."], [5386, "2016-10-26T06:30:15Z", [0.0, 0.55, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [14761, "2016-10-25T23:45:25Z", [0.02, 0.68, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [27101, "2016-10-25T21:22:19Z", [0.0, 0.46, 0.53, 0.01], ""], [22833, "2016-10-25T20:11:28Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [180, "2016-10-25T20:00:24Z", [0.2, 0.65, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [368, "2016-10-25T19:27:59Z", [0.0, 0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [14493, "2016-10-25T15:39:58Z", [0.04, 0.46, 0.46, 0.04], ""], [19801, "2016-10-25T13:08:35Z", [0.0, 0.75, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [691, "2016-10-25T12:34:08Z", [0.02, 0.71, 0.27, 0.0], ""], [3363, "2016-10-25T09:44:07Z", [0.08, 0.34, 0.48, 0.1], ""], [10759, "2016-10-25T06:20:57Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.4, 0.03], ""], [4634, "2016-10-25T06:20:37Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.4, 0.03], ""], [29729, "2016-10-25T03:49:31Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.33, 0.02], ""], [29729, "2016-10-25T03:49:02Z", [0.05, 0.6, 0.35, 0.0], "I don't know anything about oil prices.

This forecast obviously has a shorter time frame, but the point holds even if diluted somewhat. I've worked as a scientist on a lot of oil and gas projects, but not as a petroleum futures expert.  I do know that USA drillers have been so innovative at reducing costs in the last several years that they can mostly produce profitably at around $50/ barrel and much lower in any cases. And there is so much oil available in the USA and production capacity/ security is so ensured with the right prices that I don't see how even a doubtful output limit agreement between Russia and OPEC could boost prices much above $50/ barrel in the next 2 months. Having said all that, an unexpected polar vortex for instance could put Europe into an early winter onset accompanied by a forecast for it to continue through the winter, thereby blowing any $50/ barrel prediction out of the water. Likewise there are security and war concerns, and we are talking about Dubai contracts.
