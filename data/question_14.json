It is possible we could see the final case ever [worldwide] within the next year, the World Health Organization\u2019s director of polio eradication told the Guardian today. With so few cases in recent years and improved vaccination campaigns, the end may really be near.  But we\u2019ve heard this before.  . . .  \"The [worldwide] polio eradication effort started in 1988 with the aim of reaching zero cases of the wild form of the virus by 2000. Experts were skeptical given the fact that prior initiatives failed to achieve their eradication goals, such as the push against malaria starting in 1955 and against measles in 1977. . . .  \"Major gains were made,. . . but the effort failed to reach its 2000 goal. The campaign gained wider attention when the Gates Foundation joined the eradication push in 2005. Billions of dollars were injected into the effort in recent years \u2013 far exceeding the financial contributions of groups like Rotary International. As time went on and the difficult task of finishing the last mile dragged on, the projected end dates kept pushing out. \"The foundation put forward $1.8 billion in 2013 with the hopes of eradicating polio by 2018. Last year, Gates said the virus may be eradicated by 2019 and earlier this year he raised the possibility that the last case could be seen this year.  \u201cWe need some good execution and a little bit of luck,\u201d Gates said at the World Economic Forum in January. \"Right now the effort is seeing some good luck. . . .  \". . . But this does not mean all is clear. Even when cases are eliminated, it is possible for flare-ups. That is especially the case in countries where unrest and violence can cut off basic health services. Iraq, Nigeria and Syria all had cases return in 2013 after achieving eradication. Instability in Iraq allowed for cases to emerge and then cross into Syria as it dealt with its ongoing civil war.

The only two countries with on-going infections of WPV are Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a total of 6 reported cases between them. Vaccination efforts are on-going, but it's difficult in areas facing unrest. There is also a case of circulating vaccine-derived polio virus (cVDPV) to contend with, though the vaccinations causing this are being phased out. On the other hand, with only 6 cases of WPV and 1 of cVDPV at this time, the effective; although not formal; eradication of polio is a genuine prospect by the end of the year. Further, there's 10 months until the end of the year, so a high estimate should be made. It's hard to arrive at a sensible base rate for this, though my best guess of a re-infection rate put's it at 1.7% per country per year, but it's trending downwards. With 55 countries in Africa, and only 10 months to go, this would indicate to me that an estimate of 70.2% is most supported by the raw data. However, there should be a significant swing from the facts above: the low number of cases, the phasing out of the cVDPC-causing vaccine, the prospect of an effective elimination of polio. I think I'll settle somewhere in the mid-to-high 90s.

The items were representational human figures of various types.  He told me they came from Niger and Mali.  You can check examples of Dogon artifacts displayed in major museums.  Another source, the Saturday edition of the WSJ, tells the sad tale of what you could call the new evangelical form of Islam that is creating mahem in these countries.  The small story effect is that fearful people are packing up bundles of representational sculpture and selling them for scrap because they don't want to get caught with anti-Islamic items that depict the human form.  The big story effect is chaos across the mid-section of the continent.  If you sweep these disparate pieces together, you come back around to the main concern for this question.

You mentioned your Merck manual, are you a nurse? I am a BSN-RN PHN, but a very green new grad, with absolutely no experience yet, still looking for my first job. The only thing I have to inform me on this question are the most basic 101 classes in microbiology and pathophysiology, an overview of the public health model and what I learned in those classes makes me want to keep my forecast very low, and be very pessimistic. On the other hand, I look at the wonderful progress that has been made world wide since the eradication programs started in 1988, and in Africa, I see that there has been no diagnosed WPV for 2015 and I wonder if it\u2019s possible that they have pulled off an incredible achievement that was targeted for 2019. If not, they are sooooo close. They are approaching the finish line. I guess that\u2019s why the powers-that-be at GJ picked this topic for a question, curse you GJ powers! (shakes fist in air). \nStill, at the end of it all, the final success of polio eradication in Africa depends on how well the following countries (identified as \u201cstates no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread\u201d Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Somalia.  http://www.polioeradication.org/Keycountries/PolioEmergency.aspx) have complied with the plans and recommendations given over the last couple of years, and this necessitates a knowledge of their recent history of political and social conditions, and the state of their public health programs. Also, I should think the amount of concern, and public funds dedicated to the cause by governments plays a big part.\n I stand by my statements previously about the precarious and tenuous state of the whole campaign at this twilight moment before polio sets like the sun on the world horizon. Any disengagement by authorities, gaps in meeting quotas, slip ups, health care personnel problems, non-conforming to the action plans could easily manifest as individual or small outbreaks of polio somewhere. The sense of concern and warning about this is very noticeable in the October Global Eradication Initiative report. \nSo, more research digging around in google is called for, I have decided to go back up to 20% and sit there while researching how well these countries have carried out their eradication programs as best I can.

I was eager to read your post and hopeful that it would give me the clarity and confidence to make a stronger forecast.  It did, and it didn't, and it inspired me to do some more research.  Here's the factors that push me towards yes or no: Yes/WPV free:  \n-Because poliovirus can only survive for a short time in the environment (a few weeks at room temperature, and a few months at 0\u20138 \u00b0C (32\u201346 \u00b0F)) without a human host the virus dies out, if there's been no cases for over a year, then the wild poliovirus has been extinguished.\n-what is the liklihood of someone with polio from Pakistan or Afghanistan traveling to an African country, and transmitting it?  I think that this is extremely low.\n-no cases of wild poliovirus have been reported in Africa for over a year . . . . but, see below\n-large regions of the world have been polio-free for decades:  proof it CAN be extinguished.\n-the report summary says:  \"The Polio Oversight Board (POB), at its meeting at the end of September 2015, after reviewing four end-of- transmission scenarios, concluded that the most likely outcome of the eradication programme is that polio transmission will be interrupted in 2016\" (1)\n-\"environmental surveillance . . .  samples are taken from effluent sewage sites every 2\u20134 weeks for poliovirus testing. By July 2015, environmental surveillance was being conducted in 38 sites, mostly in northern Nigeria: Borno (four sites), Kaduna (three), Kano (five), Lagos (five), Sokoto (four), the Federal Capital Territory (two), Kebbi (three), Katsina (three), Jigawa (three), Yobe (three), and Adamawa (three). During January\u2013July 2015, cVDPV2 was identified in one sewage sample collected from Kaduna (March). (2)  No WPV was reported from any of these sites since 1/1/15. No/not WPV free:  \n-Among those individuals who receive oral polio vaccine, only 95 percent will develop immunity.\n-unobserved polio transmission and in vaccine-derived poliovirus: in 99% of infections, polio is a mild condition that causes very few symptoms and most infected people are unaware that they carry the disease, allowing polio to spread widely before cases are seen.\n-\"The risk of re-introduction of infection remains substantial\" in Nigeria & the rest of Africa\n-\"recent positive environmental samples in Kaduna \u2013 show that the virus is still in the country\" (1).  See above, however. Bottomline for me:  I think/hope that Africa remains wild poliovirus free.  I've been forecasting \"no\" for a while in the beginning just in case the unexpected occurs.  Since this question was launched, all the cases of polio in Africa have been circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), not a wild poliovirus.   So, I'm going to move toward the \"Yes/WPV side\". Going from 45 to 50.  Not exactly a strong forecast!!!"], [556, "2015-11-16T21:32:38Z", [0.55], "sharms10k's link (Thanks!)

This is an interesting question, because as time goes on, two opposing factors determine the risk: 1) The areas where wild polio is present become smaller and smaller as the virus dies out with no human hosts to infect\n2) Governments drop their guards as \"eradication\" becomes \"resilience\" and funding drops off. I wound up with a slightly more optimistic prediction than Khalid after checking on the history of smallpox eradication. I'd expected that, in an era when the world was poorer, technology was weaker, and our knowledge was lesser, factor (2) above would have led to a series of cases popping up just when we thought we'd won, over and over again. But that doesn't seem to have happened -- once we'd reached a state of control over smallpox similar to the control we have today over polio, smallpox disappeared very quickly. Today, we know more about epidemiology, risk communication, and every other discipline relevant to disease eradication than we did in 1975. I don't know how well polio survives in the wild compared to smallpox, but every other factor is on our side (save perhaps for people traveling more often on average, and regional populations being denser, so that any isolated patch of ground has a greater chance of being crossed -- though I don't know whether this is true in rural Nigeria given the pace of migration to cities). Anyway, to sum things up: Had this question been asked about smallpox at the same stage of the game in 1975, the optimists would've been correct. I think there's a good chance they'll also be correct about polio, given our superior ability to handle the problem in the modern era. (Honestly, it's also something of a gut feeling, and I'm trying not to stray too far from 50/50.) * * * * * Note: In the year smallpox was eradicated, something like 3000 people were infected in March. By October, it was down to three new infections, and then zero. This was in Somalia, a country with very few roads and a large population of nomads who were hard to track down. Nigeria seems like an easier place to keep infectious disease under control. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Maow_Maalin#Smallpox_eradication_in_Africa On the other hand, polio is harder to keep track of than smallpox given the high rate of asymptomatic infection, so there are more factors to balance out.

They are aiming to make 2016 the year that polio is finally interrupted worldwide, but it won't be easy. For Africa, particularly Nigeria, shifting from a focus on eradication to one of resilience requires a different mindset and approach. The concerned organizations must guard against resting on laurels and slackening efforts prematurely. I'm hopeful this will be managed in the next 59 weeks, but there's a significant risk that it may not be. For convenience, an extract from the section on Nigeria is copied below, which summarizes the risk.  \" It is vital that all levels of government, including state and regional remain engaged and do not succumb to \u201cpolio fatigue\u201d. The falling level of engagement recorded against agreed measure of local involvement for high-risk states is a cause for concern. Local government becoming detached is a major programme risk. Failure to ensure the flow of funds to do resilience properly would be a disaster. Access in the north east of the country remains difficult, and 60% of communities were not reached in Borno this year during immunization activities. This leaves a quarter of a million children missed, and low immunity to both type 1 and 2 polio virus. In addition, while the state level surveillance indicators reveal a reassuring sweep of green across the whole country, this is not the case for some sub-state areas \u2013 both for acute flaccid paralysis and environmental sampling. Poor performance must not be hidden by aggregation with better performing surrounding areas.

Two things:  (1) Polio can pop up again in places wracked by civil disorder and fighting where public health measures break down.  Africa has a number of places like this.  (2) The disease is still active in Pakistan and Afghanistan so someone could bring it back into Africa.  Many African countries have large Islamic populations.  There are some folks who travel back and forth to other Muslim countries including these two (for various reasons).

Substantial numbers of WHO and United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) polio staff in the region and from headquarters were deployed to assist in the outbreak response\" And also this, specifically about Nigeria, one of the three endemic countries: \u201cNigeria: The last WPV1 case was reported in July 2014 and Nigeria has not had a cVDPV case for over six months. cVDPV\nhas been isolated through ES as late as March 2015, so circulation remains a risk. Progress is encouraging, but fragile due\nto concerns over pockets of low immunity and challenges associated with population movements and insecurity in the\nNortheast. Despite meeting surveillance performance indicators sub nationally, the identification of orphan viruses in\n2014 and 2015 and areas of inaccessibility indicate the need to strengthen surveillance in parts of the country.\u201d Here\u2019s the link for the weekly WHO report: http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx"], [691, "2015-09-18T12:27:34Z", [0.15], ""], [1389, "2015-09-18T09:11:11Z", [0.33], "Africa is such a big continent and health-challenges can pop up everywhere given civil unrest and famine.

There have been 13 months polio-free, but in one out of the last 14 months (the one longest ago) there was a case of polio.  The time frame is 16 months to go.  100 percent /14 months = 7 percent chance a month (high) down to a zero percent chance (low) if you'd like to believe it's eradicated, no way it could spread from elsewhere, etc.  7 percent a month leaves a 93 percent chance it hasn't happened by next month to the power of 16 months leaves a 29 percent chance of Africa being polio-free after 16 months.  If I split the difference between 29 and 100 percent, since I think a seven percent chance a month is too high, I get 64.5 (remarkably similar to someone else's guess).  If I split the difference between 0 percent and 7 percent, and go with (1.00-.035)^16, that works out to 54.6 percent.  However, what do we know about eradication of other diseases, or any other analagous cases?  If the per-month chance of it coming back is really only 2 percent, then the advance probability of continued eradication by then is \"really\" closer to 72 percent.  And if you figure a 2 percent chance this month, but only a one percent change 8 months from now, and only a .5 percent chance 8 months after that (probably closer to how a good actuarial model of these events might really look), then the probability of longer-term eradication only goes up from there.  Some research into past cases of disease eradication might clarify what the marginal probability each month really might be, and better frame the overall chances.
