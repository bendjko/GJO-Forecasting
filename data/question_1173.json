See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 16.7%. [1] \n- Crowd forecast here is 0%. Inside view: \n- EWP: \"We record an ongoing non-state-led mass killing by the Taliban Movement of Pakistan (TTP) and associated militias since 2001.\" [1] So there is already an ongoing campaign of mass killing in the country. This forecast is about potential new ones.\n- Potential perpetrators include the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) [2] and ISIL [3]. Both engaged in deadly violence against civilians last year. I find it very implausible that the Pakistani government would engage in such a campaign at this point. The war with the Taliban has been going on for years. There is always a risk of course.\n- BLA seems very implausible. They have existed for a long time and I don't see any reason why it should escalate this year. They're \"just\" another run-of-the-mill terrorist group.\n- ISIL also seems fairly implausible. They killed 33 people in 2018 based on Wikipedia [4], 238 in 2017, 178 in 2016. [5] They have not claimed responsibility for any 2019 attacks. Overall judgment:\n- The EWP estimate seems too high, the crowd estimate too low. I'd estimate 5%, slightly higher than the base rate. Mainly because ISIL seems to be hard to predict.
