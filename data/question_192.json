Since late 2014, the area has suffered a series of attacks, largely attributed to a Ugandan rebel group known as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). The violence has left nearly 700 civilians dead, according to Human Rights Watch, but local sources put the figure considerably higher. \"Eastern DRC has been riven by conflict since 1994, when a massive influx of Hutu refugees fled across the border from neighboring Rwanda, fearing persecution by the new Tutsi administration in that country. Among them were many of the g\u00e9nocidaires accused of participating in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the spring of 1994.Two years later, Rwanda invaded, attacking the refugee camps that had become the temporary homes for Hutu militia groups. The Rwandan forces also toppled Congo\u2019s infamously corrupt dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.\n. . . \n\"The militias never entirely disbanded, however, and the next decade saw a spiral of messy conflicts that drew in nine African states and myriad rebel groups. The war was fueled by the region\u2019s immense natural riches. . . with the massacres in Beni continuing unabated, locals are increasingly frustrated about the inability of both the army and MONUSCO to control the violence. The ADF, they point out, is currently thought to number only a few hundred fighters.The people of Beni are also angry and afraid. . . In August, a dozen people were crushed to death in a panicked stampede after a drunken off-duty soldier fired four rounds into the air. Later that month, rioting broke out after 50 people were killed during a massacre in the Rwangoma suburb of the town.\u201cThis [ADF] conflict has been going on since 1996, but this is the worst it\u2019s ever been,\u201d . . . \n. . . \n\"A report published earlier this year by the U.N.\u2019s Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo alleged that elements of the military were in fact supporting the ADF by providing the rebels with arms and ammunition. In earlier reports, the U.N. group suggested army officers were benefiting from timber felled in the rebels\u2019 jungle strongholds.Some of Beni\u2019s residents suspect the government is using the chaos in the east as a distraction from a bitter political row over the postponement of elections until 2018. (President Joseph Kabila\u2019s legal mandate ran out on December 19.)Others argue that Rwandan Hutus are driving the violence in the hopes of snatching land traditionally owned by the ethnic Nande group, while others say that neighboring countries are stoking the violence so they can continue to benefit from the flow of gold through ADF areas.  \"The presence of an active jihadi organization has also proved a useful bargaining chip for nearby states looking to bring in foreign military aid.In a report published last March, the nonprofit Congo Research Group said it had found \u201cextensive evidence indicating that members of the FARDC [the armed forces] have actively participated in massacres.\u201dMany survivors of the killings speak of fighters dressed in the uniform of the national army. Others question why some of the attacks have been allowed to take place within minutes of army bases.\u201cThe soldiers are becoming rebels, and the government is not telling us the truth. They just fire in the air,\u201d says Vivuya, echoing a common belief in the town: that the army has been ordered not to fight the rebels. \"Beni\u2019s mayor, Nyonyi Bwanakawa, denied that the group was receiving support from the government. When Newsweek visited him at his office in downtown Beni, he was surrounded in the atrium by a group of around 40 women, widows of soldiers killed by the ADF who were demanding their unpaid pensions.Bwanakawa insisted that no members of the military have taken part in the attacks, saying ADF fighters have been stealing uniforms from the soldiers they kill, leading to confusion among the public. He added that the government changed the design of its soldiers\u2019 uniforms in August to help avoid false identification of soldiers.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  This is basically background info.

Looking under the hood a bit, it seems the model continued to predict low monthly counts throughout the forecast period, even though the observed counts were consistently higher than the predicted ones (17 per month).

This would be on the low end of the fatalities in this 2nd prediction section. If we forcasted out the highest of the year thus far, March with 119 fatalities, it would then be 833.

Additionally, if we exclude these spikes, than the average deaths per month is approximately 119.  With the contentious election decisions imminent, even taking a modest average of deaths per month, and not factoring in a spike, it still appears highly possible that there will be over 750+ fatalities.

The offensive UN mission has been very succesful in the defeat of the M23, but there are over 30 active militias in north-eastern DR Congo, especially in the Maniema, Katanga, Sud Kivu and Nord Kivu Provinces. Amongst the biggest militias are the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). The army of the DR Congo and  MONUSCO conducted succesful operations against both militias in 2015 and their strength has been reduced significantly. In 2015 the ADF still killed at least 130 civilians. Disarmament, Demobilization, Repatriation, Reintegration and Resettlement (DDRRR) Programs are ongoing and since 2002 around 10.000 FDLR-members laid down their weapons. The UN estimates that only 1.000-1.500 remained. Both militias nontheless continue to attack civlians. Aditionally, there are a lot of criminal, local \"self-defense\" forces, so called May-May-militias, that regularly attack and loot villages. Furthermore, there is ethnic violence in other parts of the country that from time to time escalates, e.g between the Luba and Pygmy. In April 2015 members of the Luba attacked a refugee camp and killed at least thirty Pygmy. Numbers:\nIn the first four months of 2015 145 killed civilians have been included in the \"violence against civilians\"-category.\nFurther three civilians have been killed by remote violence on 14.04.2016 in Sud-Kivu. That incident has not been included in the \"violence against civilians\"-category. Without any further analysis, this makes around 37 civilian deaths per month. The various militias so far are resposible for most of the deaths in the DR Kongo. If violence would maintain at the current level, this would lead to 296 deaths in the upcoming eight months. Last year (12 months instead of 8!) 956 civilians have been killed according to ACLEDs \"violence against civilians\"-category. 420 of them belong to a mass grave, digged by security forces of the DR Kongo on 18.03.2015. It is still unclear, what has been going on there: https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/18/dispatches-still-no-clarity-dr-congo-mass-grave. Without that mass grave, the number would come down to 536 in 12 months; obv. less than 750 in 8 months.  Outlook:\nThe upcoming election (whether it will take place in 2016 or not) will def.  lead to further clashes in other parts of the country. Violence in north-eastern DR Congo won't go down though it may also not intensify; security reforms are still not implemented and the area is rather remote. With the gov. being occupied by the protests, I see no major movement there. Especially since the army (or at least the presidential guard) has been deployed to crack down protests, I sadly see no way the DR Congo gets through this year with less than 350 killed civilians. I am not so sure about 750+ though.Then again, while there already have been protests against the government during the last year, they will definitely intensify; especially if Joseph Kabila will indeed run or the elections get postponed due to electoral-reform-issues, which have been regarded as a move to lay off the elections and seek an illegal unofficial third term.
