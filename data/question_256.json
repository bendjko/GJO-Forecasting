However, there are a large number of smaller ethnic groups that don't necessarily interact much with the central government, and which might have rough feelings with other ethnic groups. It don't think that a mass killing is *likely*, but I'll put it at a non-zero chance. Also note: India does have a history of mass killings.

This is one geography where historical reasons and near-term escalation of discord may cause an episode of widespread civilian deaths to qualify as mass killing. However, statistically, an episode of mass killing within a twelve month timeframe has not occurred in Kashmir, even though cumulatively there have been over 40,000 fatalities over a 25 year period. Mass killing within the purview of the definition is unlikely to happen within the timeframe mentioned.  The Naxalite-Maoist insurgency is another potential candidate for a mass killing. Even though total casualties exceeding 1000 in a year have happened before (2009, 2010), noncombatant deaths have never been close to a mass killing episode. This remains, however, a potential risk, given historical reasons.  The other geography at risk is the Indian North East, where intermittent clashes have led to episodes of civilian deaths over the years.  Terrorist acts have led to widespread deaths in single locations but have fallen short of the EWP's definition of mass killing.  In recent years, wins, or alliances, with nationalist parties has stoked reactionary sentiment, increasing the likelihood of escalation in armed conflicts .   A common thread running across the above cited instances is the demographic of the affected. They tend to be marginalised minorities, tribals, and the historically oppressed. Geographies with high densities of this demographic tend to be at higher risk of falling under the definition here. However, as things stand today, difficult to see a high likelihood of an episode of mass killing before Jan'17.
