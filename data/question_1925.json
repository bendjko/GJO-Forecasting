While they finished the regular season with a better record than their Finals opponent (the Milwaukee Bucks), advanced stats portray the Suns and Bucks as similarly strong teams. In the postseason thus far, the Suns have a slightly better net rating, but postseason stats have a smaller sample-size and are largely matchup-based. The two regular season games in which the teams matched up were determined by 1-point margins, so the results of those games are inconclusive. I believe the Suns will win however, because of their dominance throughout this postseason relative to the Bucks. The Suns comfortably defeated both the Lakers and Nuggets, and struggled slightly against the Clippers, while the Bucks only comfortably swept the Heat, having major issues against the Nets and Hawks. The Bucks have various exploitable weaknesses, including Giannis Antetokounmpo's current injury and inability to shoot the ball well, Mike Budenholzer controversial coaching decisions and lack of adjustments, and the Bucks' overreliance on 3-point shooting. The Suns have the ability to score more efficiently at the rim, in the midrange, from the free-throw line, and only slightly less efficient from beyond the arc. The Bucks have no answer for Deandre Ayton, who is having the most efficient scoring postseason of all time, and can conversely defend Giannis better than any other defender in the league (per NBA.com). Chris Paul, Devin Booker, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder, Cameron Payne, Cameron Johnson, and Torrey Craig can provide efficient offense and lockdown defense for Phoenix, whereas Milwaukee lacks the depth to square off with them. Jrue Holiday and Khris Middleton can provide star support for Giannis, P.J. Tucker can provide good defense and corner shooting, and Bobby Portis Jr. can have his way against the Suns bench lineup, but they simply aren't equipped to deal with the resilient Suns team. Additionally, Monty Williams was a frontrunner for Coach of the Year this season, and has made quality adjustments in every series, and his superior coaching along with Chris Paul's superior leadership will let this Suns team win the series in 5 or 6 games."], [95503, "2021-07-05T17:43:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.34, 0.66, 0.0], ""], [691, "2021-07-05T16:38:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.28, 0.72,

They neutralize Nikola Joki\u0107 perfectly, and will dominate probably Utah in the conference finals. Whoever wins the Eastern Conference, will find it hard to compete, allthemore all other pairs seem to need a full-stretch best-of-seven series to determine who will advance to the conference finals. \nLA Clippers: low to no chances\nBrooklyn Nets: very good season, very talented team, but a long season appears to take its toll (Harden) and they could lose focus.\nMilwaukee Bucks: even though they're the underdogs, they have a chance to recover from an early 0-2 in this series against Nets, which would put the psychologic momentum in their favor.

There are lots of other teams out there who are vying for the championship this year though. Philly and Utah are looking strong during the regular season, but neither of these squads have shown they have what it takes as players, or as established teams to win when the pressure is on in the playoffs. When picking \"another team\" you're also banking on the fact you have 26 other teams out of a pool of 30 (realistically there's only 6ish contenders). The Nets look frisky and are a wildcard here. Kevin Durant is one of few current players to beat LeBron in the finals over the past 5 years and he's looking like an MVP too. Unfortunately, the Nets team are not a well made team, and rookie coach Steve Nash may be in over his head come playoff time. Giannis is the reigning MVP too, and he looks like he's saving himself for the playoffs. I'd give him a slight nod here too. Finally, the Clippers while having a great team and arguably the second best player in the league (Kawhi) they also haven't shown they have the guts to beat the Lakers. However, I don't like betting against Kawhi given his record of success and I'd be likely to change my mind on this post All Star break.

So an injury to anyone of these players will significantly diminish the team's probabilities for winning the 2021 championship If AD and Lebron are healthy, it is most likely of the available choices that Lakers can repeat. Brooklyn, on paper, is the best team however 2 of the superstars have significant injury issues (KD and Kyrie). Harden although being an almost unstoppable offensive force, has not had any Finals experience. For the Clippers, PG is the X-factor. If he can perform like he has been in 2021 they have a at least a 25% chance of winning. Although, Giannis is showing improvement every year, he does not have a defensible track record in the playoffs.\nIt is is still possible for a dark horse candidate like Miami or Jazz to make and maybe win the Championship.

Lastly, I think that there has to be a >0% that the season gets canceled, which @Rad4Caster does, but some other people do not. Additionally, as a basketball fan my entire life, I also need to adjust the sportsbooks numbers slightly based on what i've seen.

Repeats seem at first to be fairly uncommon in the NBA, but they've happened four times in the last 20 years, with one of those being a three-peat...so 5 out of 20 years we've had a repeat winner. 25% chances aren't bad. Oh, and one of those was the Heat, with Lebron on board. Next is Brooklyn, who have a dynamic trio of all-stars. I'm on board with giving them a high likelihood of being good, but I'm not sure all three will be able to share the limelight well. They bear more scrutiny as the season wears on, and especially in tight games, as it might be an indication of how they'll perform under pressure.  The Clippers and Bucks round out the top four, and #5 is pretty clearly far beyond those top four. So it looks like we have four leaders early in the season. There's something to be said for being able to bet on the field here, though. That's another 26 teams. You can't sleep on getting to put odds on another 26. The NBA always leans pretty heavily in favor of the frontrunners, and it's not THAT often that someone comes right out and surprises everyone, but it's 26 teams! And we're still early in the season! I'm giving that choice some love, especially because Golden State's included in that number. As for no championship, I'm giving that a fairly low probability here. Of course, COVID could be crazy, but the NBA and their bubble showed us that they were the class of the American pro sports leagues, and that was when we had no vaccine and were in the *height* of the pandemic.
