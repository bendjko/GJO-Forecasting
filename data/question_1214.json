Pai is starting a rule-making process and appears to be favoring opening up the spectrum beyond the automotive industry. There is next to no chance that the FCC is going to undermine the rule-making process by granting this waiver before the rule-making process is complete.  If you review what the rule-making process entails from the FCC website, it is clear this is going to take us outside the time window.[1] They have to come up with a rule. They have to publish a notice in the Federal Register. They need to receive comments for at least 30 days. They need to allocate time for replies. Then, they need to adopt a final rule. Then, this has to go through a peer-review process. Etc. Not going to happen in the time period.

The Internet & Television Association has called the 5.9 GHz band 'the future of Wi-Fi,' saying it's a critical tool to end Wi-Fi bottlenecks.\"[2] On the other hand, \"The [Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers] contends NHTSA must complete a third testing phase to see if sharing the spectrum would even be safe. 'You can't have, call it low latency, where the signal isn't going fast enough because people are sharing it when you're in a car on a highway,' Bergquist said. 'We actually want the ability to use the spectrum and have confidence in it for autos. And we can't really speak to the idea of sharing it yet because the testing hasn't been done. If they could do the testing, and we all feel confident, that's terrific. We could share it if the testing says we could, but we just need to be sure that the spectrum is going to be safe.'[2] [1] https://www.fcc.gov/about-fcc/rulemaking-process\n[2] https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report-newsletter/states-call-preserving-talking-car-spectrum"], [62808, "2019-08-18T00:18:23Z", [0.31], ""], [1333, "2019-08-17T18:27:22Z", [0.5], ""], [691, "2019-08-15T12:06:51Z", [0.55], ""], [77475, "2019-08-11T10:17:44Z", [0.27], ""], [691, "2019-08-10T17:03:04Z", [0.55], ""], [77742, "2019-08-09T02:33:41Z", [0.6], ""], [77716, "2019-08-08T03:46:58Z", [0.5], ""], [77475, "2019-08-05T18:34:09Z", [0.29], ""], [1333, "2019-07-30T18:29:29Z", [0.49], ""], [77475, "2019-07-30T17:15:40Z", [0.31], ""], [691, "2019-07-30T13:49:52Z", [0.54], ""], [77475, "2019-07-30T06:03:04Z", [0.33], "Initial impression:  the key to this question is will they have a vote"], [59028, "2019-07-29T18:57:47Z", [0.45], ""], [1333, "2019-07-27T18:11:06Z", [0.48], ""], [691, "2019-07-27T11:20:59Z", [0.66], ""], [29980, "2019-07-23T21:58:43Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2019-07-21T13:04:40Z", [0.72], ""], [76964, "2019-07-21T09:55:42Z", [0.75], ""], [76567, "2019-07-18T12:49:31Z", [0.3], ""], [76165, "2019-07-18T07:00:53Z", [0.65], ""], [62808, "2019-07-18T00:04:27Z", [0.3], ""], [691, "2019-07-17T14:17:04Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2019-07-15T15:19:45Z", [0.77], ""], [41707, "2019-07-14T11:14:31Z", [0.4], ""], [75518, "2019-07-11T07:01:54Z", [0.15], ""], [72713, "2019-07-10T06:38:29Z", [0.55], "From what I am understanding, a section of band was set aside for the auto industry and they basically did nothing with it for the past several years.

The FCC has not provided a timeline for the rule-making, but we expect release of the rule-making sometime this summer.\"[1] \"In this new proceeding, the FCC will consider whether and how to allow sharing in the band between DSRC, gigabit Wi-Fi, and C-V2X technologies. Chairman Pai outlined a wide range of potential outcomes for the new rule-making. As examples, the FCC could:     Maintain the current allocation for DSRC(this outcome seems unlikely because the chairman has already revealed his skepticism about this approach, given the history and outlook for DSRC).\n    Allocate the band for exclusive use for C-V2X technology.\n    Allocate the band for exclusive use by automotive communications technology generally.\n    Allocate the band exclusively for unlicensed uses such as gigabit Wi-Fi.\n    Permit sharing between unlicensed uses and automotive safety and other communications in the lower 45 MHz of the band, and permit exclusive use for V2V technologies in the upper 30 MHz of the band.\n    Permit exclusive use for unlicensed technologies in the lower 45 MHZ of the band and exclusive use for automotive safety and other communications in the upper 30 MHZ of the band.\"[2] \"\u201cWe predict that the FCC will grant the 5GAA's waiver request to allow the deployment of C-V2X in the 5.9 GHz band,\u201d SNS said in response to questions via email. \u201cThis will give automakers and other stakeholders the opportunity to evaluate and compare the benefits and performance of both technologies in real-world environments, and consequently help the U.S. Government to appropriately decide which V2X technology is the best path forward \u2212 we expect to see a mandate in the early 2020s.\u201d[3] [1] https://www.internationallawoffice.com/Newsletters/Tech-Data-Telecoms-Media/USA/Hogan-Lovells/Update-on-FCC-59GHz-band-rulemaking-proceeding\n[2] https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=bd720b14-03d2-4173-9adc-3abb5fd56806\n[3] https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/sns-analysts-predict-5gaa-will-get-waiver-request-for-c-v2x-5-9-ghz-band"], [68572, "2019-06-22T13:38:57Z", [0.75], ""], [1333, "2019-06-21T17:32:31Z", [0.35], ""]]}
