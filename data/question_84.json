Here is why. Comment: Released this morning: politicians do NOT impose capital controls on an economy that is growing at a well above average ME pace.\nhttp://m.yenisafak.com/en/economy/turkeys-economy-records-over-3-percent-growth-2528892 More fundamentally, \"time is now of the essence\" as there are less than ninety (90) days for resolution of this GJ Q. Imposition of capital controls IS a major event seldom used and, often times with shorter term dire economic consequences for the country's population.(FN1)  It often leads to significant change in the existing  political leadership, an element Erdogan is very aware of. Considering the resolution date of this Q, this fact has now become a critical factor, when one takes the totality of events taking place since the failed military coup into consideration when forecasting the probability of this event.  For example, on the one hand, Erdogan like  Putin, has cleverly taken advantage of a concerned public by instilling a majoritarian form of nationalism that has commonality to a security state. (2). The Turks are a proud people yet remain, as most in EU, very sensitive to terrorism & immigrant issues. Erdogan has played good politics to these sensitivities,  in many ways unleashing a sense of greater nationalism.  More Erdogan control, yes. A complete clamp down, including capital controls, no. On the other hand, every external measure taken by Erdogan speaks to an unmistakable effort being made to conduct business with foreign partners, albeit with a clear tilt towards non EU & US partners. Whether it be w/ the Russians to further develop funding for the AKKUYU Nuclear Power Plant or, the Sino-Turkish parliamentary ratification cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the economic picture is clear. (3)  Turkish Government has no intention taking on inward looking measures such as capital controls. Late in July, they made this announcement explicitly. (4) Government still is absolutely convinced business development abroad continues to be an important key towards economic development. (5) Indeed, the Turkish Chamber of Commerce these days \"pitches\" the \"we are stronger post the coup\" claim. (6) Conclusion:  On the one hand, Erdogan is Erdogan so, there is always a \"capital control\"uncertainty argument. Importantly, however, balanced  against this argument,  Erdogan has out maneuvered the EU leaving it in a difficult corner over the so called EU Turkey immigration deal.  On this score alone, Erdogan is cleverly playing his financial package in hand. Imposition of capital controls would blow both a financial & political hole to his body politic.  NATO's chief Stolenberg even WELCOMED Turkey's right to defend itself against IS. Further geopolitical evidence slapping capital controls at this stage is simply out of question.(7) Considering all of the above-mentioned, in a sum of the parts weighted analysis, leaves one with little room for doubt: a) Erdogan's Turkey needs to get back on economic track which it has proven in the past that it can, b) Erdogan has every intention of strengthening his hand and stay in Turkey; and, c) he can only assure his position by walking this fine line of economic development on the one hand &, and maintaining his political capital through establishing his people his is making every reasonable effort to bring Turkish economic interests towards equilibrium. UNDER these circumstances, CAPITAL CONTROLS have no place. The implications are clear. A Greek or Cyprus like imposition of capital controls in Erdogan's Turkey w/in the NEXT ninety (90) days is a zero (0) probability event.

Second question seems easier to answer than the first one. It is very probable that Turkey government will impose capital controls in case of a grave crisis, since IMF is starting to acknowledge capital controls as a valid politic to manage financial crisis and Erdrogan is a traditional populist. However, the odds of capital control is smaller in a not-so hard crisis and it lowers when crisis severity drops.

In recent years, Iceland, Cyprus, Greece have taken this step in response to very acute situations. Otherwise, ther are not that many examples aside from significantly less developed economies in Africa etc.  Capital controls do not happen often in relatively sophistical economies and when they do it is usually in response to an acute situation that has developed over a significant amount of time rather than as a shock response. In each of these cases (Cyprus, Greece etc.), 5yr CDS (5 year debt insurance contracts) traded at well in excess of 10% per annum  (ie it would cost you 10%+ per year of the insured sum to insure against default of the debt issuing country) at the time of the capital control introduction.  This is quite a significant level of distress (ie holders of debt are willing to commit to paying 10% per year for 5yrs of the amount they are insuring - would you pay a total of 50% (10% per year for 5yrs) of your house value for fire insurance? Not unless that wild fire was already burning down the house next door!).  CDS contracts are a pretty good indication of the likelihood of Turkey default - which is a fair parallel to the likelihood of capital controls being introduced as an attempt to avoid such a default.  At the moment, Turkey 5yr CDS trades at 2.6%. This is elevated, but much better than Brazil (5%) or South Africa (3.2%).  CDS contracts will very likely trade at elevated levels well ahead of capital controls being introduced, so this is an effective lead indicator for this question. The Fed has now hiked and in fact Turkey 5yr CDS traded LOWER. This is despite the expectation of several more hikes in the year ahead. Capital outflows from Turkey are very unlikely to be so significant as to warrant controls.
