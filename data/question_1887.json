This leaves 22 days through 1 February 2021 for this forecast.  For the last two months, the WHO reported an average of 1,987,695 new infections per week, or 283,956 per day.  Simply following this trend, total infections reported through 1 February would be 45,108,700. Mass gatherings associated with national-level celebrations appear to have a significant impact on weekly transmissivity rates.  The two weeks after Thanksgiving saw increases in new infections above the two-month average.  Weekly infections for 7 December rose by 2,054,064 and rates for the week of 14 December rose by 2,321,202, (greater than one standard deviation).  The explanation for the delayed increase following mass gatherings is COVID\u2019s incubation and pre-symptomatic period.  COVID patients can remain pre-symptomatic between 2 and 14 days after infection, meaning reported infections don\u2019t spike for up to two weeks following mass gatherings.  The week of 4 January (the first week of data after Christmas/New Year\u2019s) already exhibits the same post-Thanksgiving trend, only on a larger scale (many more people in the Americas Region celebrate Christmas and New Year\u2019s than Thanksgiving).  New cases for 4 January rose by 2,522,297 (almost two standard deviations).  Following this trend, we should expect new infections to rise again the week of 11 January, before returning to the two-month average.  Applying the same percentage increase from the \u201cThanksgiving bump\u201d (7 to 14 December), we should expect new infections for the week of 11 January to rise 13% over the previous week.  This would put 11 January\u2019s weekly infection rate at 2,850,195.  Adding this to the two-month weekly average for the remainder of the forecast period gives us 45,971,203 confirmed COVID cases by 1 February. Two other factors worth considering are public health restrictions and vaccinations.  A cursory review of State Department travel advisories shows several countries in the Americas Region implemented more stringent travel, social distancing, and gathering requirements on or about 17 December.  Since this was largely a response to the \u201cThanksgiving bump\u201d I anticipate these measures will only restore new weekly infections to the two-month average and not further decrease infections in just 22 days. Vaccination will also have a negligible impact in the next 22 days.  Of all the countries in the Americas region, just the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile and Argentina have started administering vaccines (the latter three countries have vaccinated less than 0.5% of their populations).  The U.S. currently vaccinates approximately 500,000 patients per day and the Centers for Disease Control states that it takes up to 28 days for a patient\u2019s immune system to develop sufficient antibodies to prevent infection.  This should not significantly alter my forecast of 45,971,203 infections.   My confidence level of 67% is based on the standard deviation of the two-month weekly data (312,664).  67% of data samples should fall within one standard deviation of the mean.  Since 45.9 million is at the upper end of the designated range bracket (44M to 46M) one standard deviation above would push my forecast above this bracket."], [88452, "2021-01-10T19:23:25Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], ""], [586, "2021-01-10T18:24:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "I am pushing to 100% for more than 48m.\nBetween 06/01 and 10/01 number of cases increased for 1.91m (38861668-36943000=1918668), which give 479k per day.

Whereas North America is fluctuating quite wildly, the curve for South America appears more stable. Importantly, the more transmissible variant b.1.1.7 has only recently been confirmed in Colorado, California, Florida and New York. It is quite likely that the variant has reached both North/South America regions, given it was discovered in Kent/London as early as September. However, while it is likely to be present, the extent to which is contributing to spread is unclear. All other things equal, the inveitable introduction or continued spread of the more transmissible variant is likely to increase cases at a higher rate than what is currently seen. So what rate of confirmed cases are we currently seeing? In the past month, North America has seen an increase of approximately 400 confirmed cases/million people every day, i.e. approximately 230-235,000 cases per day. Compared to the 7th of December, this is an approximate doubling of the number of cases/day. With the introduction of the new variant, and taking into consideration Christmas and NYE, as wella as the slow rollout of vaccinations, I think it's reasonable another doubling in the month to come. While not a full month away, this would mean that on February 7th there would be approximately 460,000 new confirmed cases per day. On average, this means an additional 345,000 cases per day between now and February 1st. 24 days remain until the 1st of February. 345,000*24 = 8,280,000. For simplicity's sake,  For S America, the growth has been somewhat slower overall, but is showing a strong upwards trend currently. Assuming another doubling between now and and February 1st, this means an increase from the current 165 confirmed daily cases per million people, or 71,000, to 330 per million people, or 142,000. On average, this means 106,000 cases per day until then, or 2,544,000 cases.  39,000,000+8,280,000+2,544,000 = 49,824,000, which would put my prediction towards the very top of the question alternatives.  Going against this is the increasing immunization of people, either through exposure themselves or vaccination. Without vaccination data in South America, it is difficult to factor this in. "], [97560, "2021-01-08T23:25:04Z", [0.02, 0.05, 0.75, 0.15, 0.03], "According to the WHO website's COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update dated 3 January,  there are 36,337,439 cases in the Americas as of 3 January. There are 28 days, or four weeks, between 3 January and 1 February. The question boils down to identifying if the trend will continue (relatively) linear, or increase (steeper slope), or decrease (trend downwards). According to the Weekly Epidemiological Update (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---5-january-2021), there were 1,935,621 new cases over the past week in the Americas.  If that straight trend continued, that would be 7,742,484 new cases in the next 4 weeks, meaning 44,079,923 cases on 1 February.  - The week of 3 January, the case rise was 1,935,621\n- The week of 27 December, the case rise was 1,965,774\n- The week of 20 December, the case rise was 2,321,202\n- The week of 13 December. the case rise was  2,054,064\n- 6 Dec: 1,845,816\n- 29 Nov: 1,652,915\n- 22 Nov: 1,603,498\n- Going further back to 1 November for a sanity check: 999,652 new cases. Bottom line: Cases in the Americas are steady, or going up.   So the weekly change has a low boundary of 1.6 million and a high of 2.3 million over the past 6 weeks; that is a difference of 700,00 cases per week.  Extrapolated over 4 weeks, that could lead an error of 2.8 million if the lower number is used as opposed to the higher number.  That is definitely enough to move from one bin to another bin, so it is fairly important to get the upper and lower boundaries correct. - I don't believe the vaccine will play a major role in stemming the rise of cases.  There just is not enough people receiving the vaccine quickly enough to stem the rise. - However, Christmas gatherings could significantly increase the rate at which people spread the disease.  Christmas is a Christian holiday, which the vast majority of American nations practice Christianity.   - Let's assume an average of 2.5 million new infections per week over the next four weeks (a higher number than we've seen, but reasonable boundary).  That would be 10 million new cases, putting us just over 46 million confirmed cases.   - If there were 1.6 million new cases a week (lower boundary), that would be 6.4 million new cases, putting us at 43 million cases.  - 2 million cases a week seems like the sweet spot.  That is 8 million over the next 4 weeks, which puts us at 44,337,439. I don't see rates significantly slowing down.  I don't think there is enough to get us over 46 million either.  The sweet spot is 44-46 million.  "], [96717, "2021-01-08T23:15:38Z", [0.02, 0.13, 0.51, 0.22, 0.12], "I expect in the next 22 days that confirmed cases will average 300,000 per day.

I do not expect this to slow down in the next few weeks since those that were exposed during the holidays will start getting sick right about now. With quarantine fatigue and the unlikely potential for shutdowns effecting the numbers for several weeks even if implemented today, I do not see this being anything less than the current weekly average of 306,443.571 cases per day. At this average, we would be in the 44,000,000-46,000,000 bin by 1 Feb (306,443.571*24=7,354,645.704+37,538,493=44,893,138.704). However, today\u2019s numbers are probably more telling, as we have reached 348,951 cases and the reporting period is still not over. I can easily see the numbers in the U.S. getting up to around 270,000-300,000 cases a day on its own. The U.S. had 260,937 cases reported yesterday according to a source other than the WHO, who is a little bit slower at increasing numbers. However, the U.S. is at 227,369 today according to the WHO. The other site I used has a similar number for two days ago, at 234,711. I expect tomorrow\u2019s WHO numbers for the U.S. will likely be somewhere between 240,000 and 260,000, and the total for the Americas will also likely go up significantly. There are always dips in the numbers over the weekends, so I expect that the average will stay somewhere in Bin 4 for now, but we will see as the next few days show us what is happening after the holiday family gatherings.  I didn\u2019t calculate the first bin because I don\u2019t think we will see numbers that low at all.
