Beyond that, market trends across sectors are toward consolidation and acquisition. 2) Inside perspective: AWS is amazons most powerful and profitable division. Other than the web store, AWS is very nearly one half of the company. More over, the unanimity of amazons presence and size, and synergies from keeping their own web page in their own platform, forbid consideration of a spin off. 3) i restricting the question: regulatory action would be highly likely to fail, barring the adoption by the courts of a new anti-trust regime. Anti-trust cases are predicated on market dominance, but AWS has many virile competitors. The courts have not even begun the process of adopting new anti-trust rules, so there is no reason to on the horizon to believe any legal pressure will have effect. 4) why 5%? People make mistakes, businesses, even massive ones, fall from grace. Without a more refined statistical analysis predicated on data not available to me I cannot assess the question in a more fine grained way. So I\u2019m assessing the probability in units of 5 points.

Splitting off AWS could save Amazon lots of time spent in restructuring down the line. On the other hand though, AWS does account for much of the income of Amazon. In 2020 Q4, AWS accounted for 52% of Amazon's operating income. It is essentially a cash cow for Amazon that allows Amazon to take risks such as the Kindle, Alexa, or the FireStick.

The only company I cannot find a spinoff for is CVS. We cannot use this -- that 19 of these 20 companies have had spinoffs -- directly however. After all, predicting a spinoff of AWS is significantly different than predicting whether Amazon will ever spin off a subsidiary at all. Let's say that these companies have had an average life of (approximately) 20-40 years, and 1-3 spinoffs for an average of 2 (based on the research I did online this seems reasonable, but not too sure). There is about 0.5 of a year left until 1 January 2022. This gives an average of 0.95*2/30*0.5 which is just over a 3% chance of an Amazon spinoff until 1 January 2022.  But, considering that predicting a spinoff of AWS is significantly different than predicting whether Amazon will ever spin off a subsidiary at all and considering that Amazon has a particular situation rather than just being the aggregate of tech and retail companies, we should now take the inside view. There are a couple of factors here pointing in opposite directions. On one hand, Jingdong mall is similar to Amazon being an e-commerce company based in China and has had spinoffs in late 2020 and early 2021, suggesting it would not be unreasonable if Amazon did the same. On the other hand, there is historical (https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/aws-ceo-laughs-off-amazon-spin-off-question/) and recent (https://www.gfmag.com/topics/blogs/jassy-promotion-dims-amazon-web-services-spinoff) news suggesting that Amazon will not spin off AWS.

As a result, and assuming there is not a significant change in inertia in such a short period, I put the probability at 5% as a starting value. From my perspective, there are three reasons for Amazon to spin-off AWS: 1.  Regulatory Requirement Driven by Antitrust Lawsuit:  The news of antitrust lawsuits against Amazon has been increasing.  There are lawsuits from Europe (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/eu-investigates-amazon-what-it-means-for-us-antitrust-probes.html) as well as the Washington DC (https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/dc-s-antitrust-suit-against-amazon-will-rely-on-high-burden-of-proof-8211-experts-64539029).  Further, the new FTC chair is Lina Khan, who has expressed antitrust concerns related to Big Tech (https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox & https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-ftc-chair-tech-24fa3aa0-d3ba-47b0-bbda-db87f401ac25.html).   This takes time and it is hard.  Further,  according to form FTC chair William Kovacic in referencing the Washington DC antitrust lawsuit, \"There isn't a body of litigation that has looked at this in detail, in this setting, in trial proceedings.\" \"Without the benefit of cases that have said 'this practice is anti-competitive,' you have to explore some new terrain. The burden is always on the plaintiff to show anti-competitive effects.\" At the same time, the Axios article indicates, \"If Khan pursues a wide-ranging regulatory agenda, as she is expected to, and quickly gets another Democratic commissioner confirmed, the FTC can move to pursue aggressive cases and enforcement, especially with the support of Congress.\"  Could something happen quickly?  Maybe, but it is dependent on getting another Democratic commission confirmed quickly.  If this happens, this would change my probability. 2.  Shareholder or Board Activism to Unlock Latent Value:  This seems unlikely for several reasons.  (A) With a new CEO in February 2021 (https://www.vox.com/recode/22264330/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-aws), it does not seem likely the Board of Directors would want to announce such a large corporate change in the first year with a new CEO.  (2) Amazon's retail business is in high gear around Christmas.  This is an enormously important time of the year.  Taking focus away from execution would be problematic in my opinion and damage the new CEO's credibility.  (3) With the annual shareholder meeting most likely in May 2022 (based on 2019 - 2021 timing), it would make the most sense to announce a spin-off in Q1'2022 or at the annual shareholder meeting itself.   (4) With a significant portion of the profitability of AMZN associated with AWS, which is important to create investments in other business units, it is not clear where the new incremental free cash flow would be sourced to fund innovation in the rest of the business.  As a result, it is not obvious a spin-off is accretive to shareholders, who are typically focused on long-term growth opportunities.  If AMZN turns into a value-oriented firm whereby generating free cash flow to return to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks, I could see a reason for AWS to spin-off.  That does not seem to be the case today. 3. Game Theory:  With increasing pressure from antitrust regulators around the world, the most cooperative Big Tech firm to regulatory changes may be able to better control the impact of regulation on their core business.  This may be in the form of a settlement with a multi-year implementation or the creation of internal firewalls between subsidiaries (i.e. large commercial banks such as Bank of America or JP Morgan).  As this type of game theory takes multiple months to negotiate, raise through proper channels, and would likely need board approval, unless it is already being discussed, it is less likely to happen before 1 January 2022.   Areas to Monitor:\n- Language from New FTC Chairwomen:  Lina Khan wrote a note titled, Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox, in the Yale Law Journal: https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\n- New Commissions at the FTC:  https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-ftc-chair-tech-24fa3aa0-d3ba-47b0-bbda-db87f401ac25.html\n- European Antitrust Regulators:  The pace of the recently announced European antitrust lawsuit against Amazon is worth monitoring.  Europe has historically had a stronger antitrust framework and enforcement mechanisms.  Europe is the biggest wild card as they have the more experience with antitrust regulations and frameworks.  https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/eu-investigates-amazon-what-it-means-for-us-antitrust-probes.html. \n"], [101235, "2021-06-19T18:13:57Z", [0.12], ""], [101422, "2021-06-18T06:25:02Z", [0.5], ""], [101420, "2021-06-18T04:21:59Z", [0.85], ""], [101414, "2021-06-17T19:32:16Z", [0.0], ""], [101413, "2021-06-17T18:53:47Z", [0.0], "Comment deleted on Jun 17, 2021 06:54PM UTC"], [101410, "2021-06-17T17:57:12Z", [0.17], "While Big Tech is under the radar for Senator Amy Klobucher, in charge of the antitrust subcommittee, and pressure is increasing on tech companies who are creating conglomerates in different sectors of the economy hampering open competition and are creating closed systems which have little interoperability, the value of AWS is extremely high on the market currently (up to 500 $ billion) and its growth and margin is significantly higher than the rest of Amazon, which will make it very hard for Amazon to accept to sell it, and to sell it beneath market value should pressures increase on Amazon to do so as competitors would wait until the price falls."], [101307, "2021-06-17T16:43:16Z", [0.04], "The primary incentive for a company to spinoff a subsidiary is the added potential for financial benefits, if the strategic priorities of the companies are diverging, if it's interested in getting acquired, or (particularly relevant in the case of Amazon) to avoid anti-trust scrutiny.

Various experts close to Big-Tech and antitrust regulation predict that given the history of Big-Tech's response to anti-trust, Facebook and Google will be the first to be hit by government regulation, at which point Amazon will follow.

I found this not great resource https://www.stockspinoffs.com/recent-spinoffs/. This lists 30 spinoffs in 2016, 23 in 2017, 22 in 2018, 19 in 2019, and 13 in 2020 (avg 21.4 / year). There are ~3500 public stocks in the US so an approximate base rate of 0.6%. Given uncertainty in data, I think it's far more likely this undercounts spinoffs than overcounts them, so I would estimate between 0.25% - 3% of public companies have a spinoff per year. We have slightly less than 8 months left in the year, but this question is about announcing vs completing, and it looks like this often takes ~2 months, so we'll go with 10/12 * (0.25 - 3%) and a base rate of .21% - 2.5% base rate range.  Reasons spinoff more likely than base-rate...\n- Lots of folks believe this is a good idea based on businesses being separated with different capital needs\n- Tech stock getting bid up dramatically these days\n- Regulatory pressure to split companies\n- Belief that spinoff can unlock growth for AWS because of customer concerns (e.g Walmart won't use AWS) https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/former-amazon-senior-engineer-calls-for-aws-spinoff.html Reasons against spinoff...\n- Bezos replacement is the former CEO of AWS. He likely has empire building reasons to keep AWS in-house and has publicly laughed at the idea. https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/aws-ceo-laughs-off-amazon-spin-off-question/\n- So long as Amazon continues to own the spinoff, it seems unlikely competitors with Retail like Walmart will want to to spend money in AWS anyway. The only way to assuage this concern would be divestment, which would force Amazon to give up ownership of arguably the best growth asset in business. Unlikely!\n- Regulatory focus on Amazon doesn't really seem to be about AWS, more about the Retail side, if anything.  Overall I'd say the unique structure which enables a spinoff makes this a lot more likely than the base rate. Regulatory risk is a huge uncertainty.

What is good for consumers in the short term, promises a powerful monopoly at squeezingly higher price levels in the future. This will be a main point that the FTC will have to deal with at a certain point. The question is, whether they will wait until it will basically be too late for brick-and-mortar retailers to surive, which would be sad.\nTwo points from the most recent news make me bet higher on this question for a 2021 pre-emptive aws IPO:\n/amazon.com Inc. is the combination of two economic superpowers in one conglomerate: the world market leader in online retail owns the world market leader in web services and cloud computing (market share 31%, challenged by Microsoft Azure (20%), Alpahabet's Google Cloud branch (7%) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (6%). In the public sector cloud business, aws commands almost half of the market (45%).\n/aws has a CEO of its own, which might be determined to be Teresa Carlson, currently aws vice president of international public sector business, and recently Amazon.com Inc. also reported  progress of its HQ2 in Arlington, VA construction, which some describe as a \"glass poop emoji covered in trees\" architecturally by some. Although the timeline for construction is not outlined, a having second headquarter clearly points to preparedness and the ability to fully disintegrate and separate the operational businesses of both amazon businesses in the future. From the market valuation perspective and experiences with conglomerates from the past, such as General Electric (GE) or Siemens, it is well known that the stock markets dislike conglomerates and see a higher value added in IPOs for a couple of reasons (risk, flexibility, agility of business restructuring, focus), and especially Siemens has a track record of disintegration of business sectors to the maximum and now more or less a financial holding company. In order to maximize its own market valuation, amazon.com Inc. could be tempted to go this way by its own choice sooner or later.

Standard Oil was a monopoly for decades and for almost two decades after the Sherman Act was passed before the USG forced a break up.[1]   The Biden administration is putting in place its personnel quickly, but it will be at least several months before the key decision makers in the Justice Department, who would decide the way forward on Amazon, will be confirmed and up to speed.  New administrations customarily engage in policy reviews of important issues facing them when they start their term.  This sort of policy review would have at least 90 to 120 days of inter-agency consultations.  AWS's role in the national security community will only lengthen the inter-agency fighting over the policy.  If the DOJ, announced an action to break up Amazon, including forcing a spin-off of AWS, it would happen in late summer at the earliest under the most optimistic scenario.

He disdains measurements of GAAP profit, and Wall Street valuation metrics seems to agree - as per a now-old AMZN assessment from Barrons:    https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-is-a-free-cash-rocket-ship-time-to-jump-on-board-51578099601 . \nBut valuing something as a multiple of sales, without any earnings or cash flows behind it, can be quite problematic as the euphoria wears off. \nSo then we have to get more granular, \nThe Sep 30 AMZN earnings release indicated TTM Operational CF of $55billion and TTM FCF of $29 billion.: https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazoncom-announces-third-quarter-results.\nBut it gets squishy about how much CF comes from AWS. Rough guess: If service revenues over the TTM went from $83B to $113B - how much of that can realistically be from things like Prime? More likely it is in the main from AWS, whose CFs and profits are scalable at this point - they're likely minting coin from all the prior CapEx.  \nSo if I estimate 80% of service revenue as AWS - 70-80% of company cash flows are coming from this one SBU. That infers strongly that Bezos would not suffer the divestiture or IPO of AWS if he wants to continue using its strong cash flows to support growth in all areas, especially its newer business that have not yet scaled up to generate its own sustainable cash flows.\nAnd Wall Street would not have doubled the stock in one year if it was actually valuing multiples of revenues with nothing behind it-. It's probably valuing tomorrow's price at multiples of today's cash flow (in whatever manner measured) with a growth factor based upon continued expectations of topline growth.. From supporting operational needs to supporting Wall Street valuations - to me AWS becomes a \"must-keep\" for Bezos.\nThus - I'm thinking there's minimal chance of spinoff before 1-1-2022"], [96758, "2020-12-22T18:19:28Z", [0.04], ""], [62808, "2020-12-21T22:40:22Z", [0.0], ""], [97442, "2020-12-21T18:43:57Z", [0.12], ""], [95789, "2020-12-21T14:33:05Z", [0.04], ""], [95789, "2020-12-21T14:32:52Z", [0.14], ""], [97424, "2020-12-20T19:13:11Z", [0.17], "There will likely be some continued discussion on regulating big-tech.

If anyone has a good resource on historical DOJ anti-trust cases and their average length etc, would be highly interested.  There are three broad reasons for a spinoff.  (1) Economic benefit, through some combination of enhanced earnings, but more typically through higher valuation;  (2) as a means of defending against a corporate takeover, by selling the most valuable assets of the firm to a friendly third party [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewel_Defense#:~:text=In%20business%2C%20when%20a%20company,attracted%20to%20the%20company%20assets.]; (3) Due to government-mandated action, typically due to anti-trust It's pretty clear that Amazon is too big to be taken over by anyone, so (2) can be ruled out. On (1) the entire business already commands a premium valuation, and so spinning out AWS isn't a great way to get a valuation boost. You could argue that spinning it out could improve earnings growth, but I doubt that matters much.  So that leaves (3), and that's exactly what Amazon has said on the issue: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/aws-ceo-we-would-follow-the-law-if-regulators-demand-amazon-spin-out.html So it comes down to what the anti-trust action will be, and how swift it could be.  First, let's distinguish anti-trust from the other ways of \"going after\" amazon via taxes. Some form of explicit \"Amazon tax\" seems likely and feasible with a Biden administration: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/i-think-amazon-should-start-paying-their-taxes-joe-biden-says.html Anti-trust, on the other hand, is a slower process and requires some pretty clear hurdles to be met, either consumer harm or bad acts. It seems pretty clear that there is a massive consumer surplus from Amazon, and so then you're on to bad and anti-competitive acts. I have no view as to whether Amazon is doing these things, but it takes time to assemble and advance such cases. IBM (colloquially known as the Vietnam of the DOJ) took 13 years, and Microsoft took 11 years.  So the probability is low. Let's assume the average DOJ anti-trust investigation can be wrapped up in 2 years, with a 1 year standard deviation. This is a complete made up distribution, but I had trouble finding historical case database. I'm assuming that the IBM and Microsoft cases were tail events, and that Democrats will push to advance the investigation, if there is one, much quicker. The fact that a suit has been filed against Google is illustrative of this. So that means there would be something like a 16% probability of concluding the case after 1 year.  Let's assume the probability of the govt winning is 50%.  And let's further assume the probability of a spinoff as a result of the govt win is 50% (to me it seems more liekly that they would just want money, but let's assume 50%).  16% * 50% * 50% = 4%.  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/aws-ceo-we-would-follow-the-law-if-regulators-demand-amazon-spin-out.html"], [86367, "2020-11-01T02:27:18Z", [0.15], ""], [41952, "2020-11-01T01:34:10Z", [0.5], ""], [92079, "2020-11-01T01:23:05Z", [0.0], ""], [15500, "2020-10-31T21:20:14Z", [0.05], ""], [11817, "2020-10-31T19:45:24Z", [0.03], ""], [96546, "2020-10-31T19:25:35Z", [0.09], "Amazon and AWS have not made such statements.

It will be the first year of a Democratic presidency, and perhaps full Democratic control of house and senate. It will take significant time to build a true anti-trust case and put real pressure on Amazon. An actual anti-trust case will take many years to litigate and Amazon is unlikely to initiate a spin-off until deep into the process and a clear understanding of where future anti-trust laws may evolve to. A self-initiated spinoff would be very unusual move. Given the dominance of AWS and the synergy effects from being embedded within the Amazon ecosystem, they are likely to keep things as is. Also, given that an Amazon spin-off has not occurred so far in it's history it makes the short time frame of the question extremely unlikely.
