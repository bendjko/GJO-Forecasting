For today's incumbent, Theresa May, the past 24 hours must have felt even longer. When May traveled to Brussels on Monday, it was in the expectation that she would sign a historic agreement with European Union leaders that would enable Brexit talks to move on to a crucial new stage -- the nature of a future relationship between Europe and the UK. The timetable was tight: The remaining 27 EU nations are set to meet on December 14 and 15 to decide if \"sufficient progress\" has been made to move on to the second phase of negotiations. Even though Britain doesn't leave the EU until 2019, businesses want clarity now so they can make crucial investment decisions. So, the choreography was set: a working lunch with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, followed by a meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk and capped off with a triumphant statement to the House of Commons in London on Tuesday. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, right, greets British Prime Minister Theresa May in Brussels.\nIt didn't quite work out like that. May relies for support in the UK Parliament from a small but hardline party in Northern Ireland -- the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). And when the DUP's 10 members of Parliament got wind of the language in the May's deal around the arcane but historically significant issue of the Irish border, they had something of a public meltdown. May was forced to abandon her plans and return to London (para. 1-5). What will happen now? The European Commission has made it clear that it believes a deal was done. The Irish government's position is the same. The clock is ticking: EU officials say an agreement must be made within days if the UK wants a European summit on December 14 and 15 to agree to move on to trade talks (para. 28). But all sides are prepared to give May time to square off the 10 MPs of the Democratic Unionist Party. \"The show is now in London,\" one official said. Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, British Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted he was \"very confident\" that there would me movement over the coming days. \"We have made a lot of progress over the last weeks,\" he told reporters. \"We have made tremendous steps forward.

The Daily Telegraph newspaper said the net bill would total 45 billion to 55 billion pounds ($53 billion to $65 billion). A government official cast doubt on those numbers and the European Commission declined to comment, but there is a growing expectation that the sides will clinch a deal on cash. Veteran Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said Britain should walk away from the talks rather than offer such huge sums. \u201cThis is a complete sell-out that is not in our national interest,\u201d said Farage, a former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) who played a big role in the 2016 referendum in which 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU. \u201cThe British prime minister needs to say: \u2018Look, either start to behave reasonably, either start to behave in a grown-up way, or ... we are walking away\u2019,\u201d Farage, who remains a member of the European Parliament, told Reuters (para. 1-5).

On Wednesday, it was quietly interred by the government as it capitulated on the amount it will have to pay for a divorce settlement. And this was not Britain\u2019s first capitulation over Brexit, nor \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 will it be the last, analysts said. What Mr. Johnson was saying was that Britain could secure the economic benefits of membership in the European Union without paying a penalty or being subject to its rules, particularly on the free movement of labor within the bloc. On Wednesday, Britain reportedly agreed in principle to a divorce check of around $47 billion to $53 billion in the hope of securing the start of talks on a future trade arrangement with the 27 nations. The unofficial offer, which covers commitments made while a member of the club, roughly doubles Britain\u2019s initial $24 billion pledge, made in September, which fell flat with the European Union leadership. For months, supporters of the withdrawal, known as Brexit, have rejected the idea of paying a substantial exit bill to honor commitments. Some, like the Euroskeptic lawmaker John Redwood has insisted that Britain owed nothing at all. Yet, with time running out for Britain before it departs in March 2019, such pledges have collided, brutally, with reality. Earlier this year, Britain\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Davis, told Parliament he could achieve a trade deal with the European Union that provided the \u201cexact same benefits\u201d as its current membership in the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union. He has not repeated that promise recently, probably because European leaders have said repeatedly that Britain cannot possibly enjoy the benefits of membership if it is outside the bloc (para. 1-8).

But that requires the two other initial issues to have made progress toward an agreement; there is so far no clue as to how the Irish border problem can be sorted out - the UK side seems better at defining solutions that it will not agree to, than defining a workable method of having an invisible border between the EU and a Northern Ireland outside the EU Customs Union. \nThe lack of a \"strong and stable\" government in Germany can now be added to the UK's lack of a \"strong and stable\" leader.

(How ever much they might want it, you cannot have no border controls with Ireland and for the UK to outside the Customs Union for example. A simple Free Trade deal will not give the UK the same ability to trade in services inside the EU as it does now.) Unless she wants to continue to fail I suggest a different approach. She should cut the Gordian Knot and propose a single simple solution that can be agreed with the EU. e.g. immediately leave the EU (to please the Brexit camp) but remain in the EEA on exactly the same terms (to please the Remain camp). The EU would need to agree that once in the EEA the UK can start talks with the EU about changes to the relationship between the EEA members and the EU (the EU has already thought about doing so). Instead of trying to sell this idea to the pro-Brexit MPs Mrs May should present the idea as take-it-or leave-it. If they don't want her plan she would resign. The MPs would then need to find someone else that would be capable of finding a solution to Brexit (my view is that there is no much different to what I have suggested that would work.) That would be better than just dithering and arguing which way to turn as the UK drifts into the rocks.

Mrs May gets weaker still. If the UK had any hope of negotiating a \"unique bespoke\" trade deal with the EU and getting it agreed before before March 2019 then that hope is disappearing, as the EU has already pointed out that the deal would need ratification to start by October 2018, which is less than one year from now. It has so far taken 7 months to make no noticeable progress on the 3 items that were to be dealt with before talks on trade are started, so at this rate nothing will be agreed on trade in the next 12 months.  It has just got harder for Mrs May to sell to voters a financial deal that will cost more than the Brexit press have  lead Brits to expect, (The UK Government is currently very busy stabbing each other in the back, any weakness and Mrs May will be out). Davis appears to be happy to string things out until the EU gives up, but the EU presumably believes that as the UK needs a deal more than the EU does,  and that the UK will blink first. It seems that it is generally accepted that \"no deal\" would be worse than any deal. If the UK has already run out of time for a \"unique bespoke deal\" that seems to leave only 2 options (a) stay in the EU after March 2019 - either permanently or for a long enough period to negotiate a \"unique bespoke trade deal\"  OR  (b) the UK agree to what is more or less an existing EU trade deal e.g. the Single Market and Customs Union, plus Services (call it EEA+).  Note (a) would not be an \"implementation\" period because an agreement would need to already exist before you can start to implement it.  It is possible (but unlikely) that the EU will allow trade talks to start without any agreement on outstanding liabilities on the grounds that some progress has been made. The issue then for Forecasters will be has this question actually been answered, Since March 2017 polls show that confidence in Mrs May getting a good Brexit deal have declined from just under 50% to under 40%; over 60% think \"no deal\" would be bad or very bad, vs only around 15% that think it would be good or very good. Already the majory think that Brexit will make them worse off, by this time next year if there is no deal agreed that majority will become a lot bigger.

They're just one of two parties in the negotiation.  It would be just as legitimate for the UK to declare that there would be no talk on the rights of EU citizens at all until there was an agreement on financial services access. This is, of course, a typical negotiation style for the French-led faction, who (for example)  waited for the regular CAP negotiations to end, then afterward demanded a reduction in the British rebate in 2005.  When Britain noted the rebate was what the UK got instead of French-level CAP payments, the French turned around and declared that the CAP had just been \"settled\" and _of_course_ could not be re-opened, while the rebate wasn't.  This \"two-stage\" strategy cost Britain 20% of its rebate 2007-2013. Given this history of bad faith, it accordingly would be entirely stupid for Britain to \"settle\" any issue, particularly the so-called \"outstanding liabilities\", without concessions from the EU on issues of importance to the UK.  Refusing to go along with the EU framing of what \"requires\" progress first, or what constitute \"commitments\" that survive the end of membership, while trying to win concessions in the \"side talks\" that always surround any formal international negotiation, is the only rational negotiation strategy for the UK to take."], [39568, "2017-10-18T13:17:31Z", [0.05], ""], [39523, "2017-10-18T07:03:34Z", [0.0], "Not this Year"], [39949, "2017-10-17T20:27:46Z", [0.2], ""], [368, "2017-10-17T20:04:02Z", [0.0], ""], [37115, "2017-10-17T17:09:41Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T21:50:32Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-10-16T21:29:31Z", [0.0], ""], [36188, "2017-10-16T18:44:33Z", [0.15], ""], [40704, "2017-10-16T16:07:04Z", [0.35], "Judging by some of the other forecasts on here my forecast seems on the optimistic side so I'd like to share my thinking. Firstly, a country has never withdrawn from the European Union before so I think there is very limited certainty about how negotiations will proceed and nothing to benchmark the UK's negotiations against. However, the consensus view (which I broadly agree with) seems to be the negotiations are not going well. It had been hoped that by now progress would have been made on the three issues (financial settlement, the rights of citizens and the status of the Irish border) that the EU require progress to be made on before negotiations move to the next phase of talks. Taking the issue that this forecast focuses on - financial settlement - it appears some progress has been made in recent weeks but not enough to satisfy the EU. The UK government faces a difficult political situation on this issue that it doesn't want to be viewed as caving in to the EU but at the same time if a deal is to be done with the EU then trade talks do need to start in the near future (and almost certainly in advance of the New Year). Meanwhile the EU favours some kind of deal and moving to trade talks but needs to be seen to be holding the UK to its financial commitments in regards to liabilities.   it's important to remember in all this that while there is a lot of bravado on both sides in relation to the negotiations there is also the cold reality that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal - a so-called hard Brexit - then they'll be a significant economic impact on both the UK and the EU, something which I think all governments concerned would be very keen to avoid.  I see the possible scenarios broadly as:\n1) Talks collapse in the next two months and the UK pursues a hard Brexit approach, which means no agreement on payment\n2) The impasse on the three issues is broken and the December EU Council meeting agrees to allow negotiations to proceed. It's important to note that this would likely involve an agreement on payment but there are definitely some possible scenarios where the agreement on payment is left a little fuzzy, which might mean 'agreement on payment' in relation to this forecast has not been met\n3) The first stage of talks drag on into the New Year, which means no agreement on payment before 1 January 2018 Based on this my view is it's not likely the United Kingdom and the European Union reach an agreement on payment of the UK's outstanding liabilities to the EU before 1 January 2018. However, I certainly think there are scenarios where it is possible - hence my forecast of 35%.

As is well known this famous British military disaster was eulogised as demonstrating the bravery of British Cavalry in charging to their certain death straight at the Russian artillery. A order had been given that had been wrongly interpreted to mean the Light Brigade was to charge the guns. Those whose duty was to carry out the order could see that it would result in a disaster, but felt that they were honour bound to do what they thought they had been ordered to, rather than refuse.   \"Theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die\" I feel that Brexit is been approached the same way. The referendum to leave the EU was really a referendum on \"are you fed up with things in general? If so lets blame someone. Vote to leave the UK and we promise things will be great!\" Most voters did not actually expect that the vote would be for Brexit. But having voted for Brexit it seems that,like the Light Brigade, the UK thinks it has a duty to carry out the voters orders, even though those carrying out the orders can see that doing to can only lead to disaster.  Very few politicians are willing to say the orders are crazy and that they will disobey, some politicians are trying to carry out the orders which they know are crazy, but are trying to go in a slightly different direction to avoid the worst of the massacre, while other are bravely and nobly headed straight into it, a few are too stupid to understand what they are doing.  That 15 months after the referendum no noticeable progress has been made in the negotiations and that the government is still split between those who favour riding straight \"into the valley of death\" (hard Brexit) and those who prefer a slow careful advance (soft Brexit), seems to show that most of the government realise that Brexit will be a disaster. I don't think they actually have anything as clear as a plan, but they have a hope that if they slow things enough, that something will turn up that will stop the nightmare. Maybe they will lose an election and some other party can deal with the mess, or maybe Mrs Merkel or Mr Macron will come up with some way out. Or maybe the public will grow tired and forget that its their duty to carry out the popular will.  So I think excuses to drag out reaching out any agreement on any part of Brexit will continue, until a way to stop or postpone Brexit for as long as possible it found.

Mrs May's Florence speech was supposed to promote this idea. I do not detect any signs of this happening and its more likely that Mrs May admitting that the UK needs an interim deal, so that any new trade deal would not start until 2021, will encourage the EU to keep to the order of issues that was agreed by the 27, and is being followed by Barnier. In spite of the media saying that the current sticking point of the negotiations is the financial settlement, I see the real problem as how to deal with the Irish border. I have not heard any credible answer to how trade and migration between Northern Ireland and Eire can remain as it is now except by having have both sides inside the same free movement area and customs union. The UK has asked the EU to be creative, but has not itself provided possible answers. The UK does have a point that the Irish border question seems to be closely tied up in what trade deal ends up in place, but as far as I can see the only \"significant progress\" that could be made now would be for the UK and EU to agree that the end deal needs to include free movement and continuation of the customs union. (I am mystified why the UK agreed to the EU's order of issues, when it was obvious that it would create this difficulty.) \nThe UK could agree a financial settlement outline without there being any trade deal, but the only financial deal it could agree now would involve paying the EU a lot more than the keen Brexiteers want to pay without being able to claim it was to \"pay for trade\". May will have to face her party conference in a few days and is not likely to make any offers to the EU until after that. The only evidence that an agreement on the finance might be possible is that the most outspoken hard Brexiteers seem to be lacking in the numbers needed to tell the EU to \"go and whistle for the money\". \nThe expectation that the negotiation impasse  would be saved by Macron and Merkel's intervention looks some way off, and the German election has not brought this forward. The expectation is that Merkel will be very busy with domestic matters for at least weeks, possibly months. Even if the EU agrees to move on to trade talks presumably the UK would still not want to agree a financial settlement until there was some agreement on the trade talks. So we could be talking about another year!

On citizens' rights, our priority in this negotiation:\n* \t\u2022\tThe issue of guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom has not been solved.\n* \t\u2022\tIt is absolutely necessary that all these citizens, hundreds of thousands of whom are Italian citizens living and working in the United Kingdom, can continue to live as they did before, with the same rights and safeguards.\n* \t\u2022\tThis is a human and social question, which the European Parliament and its president, Antonio Tajani, are vigilantly watching, and rightly so.\n* \t\u2022\tCitizens should be able to enforce their rights directly from the withdrawal agreement. This would prevent any possible dilution of these rights, if the rules implementing them in the UK were to change.\n* \t\u2022\tIn the same way, we want these rights to be valid in national courts and that national courts have the possibility \u2013 or even the obligation \u2013 to refer questions related to the interpretation of rights deriving from European law to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice would remain the ultimate guarantor of the agreement.\n* \t\u2022\tThis is for a simple reason: rights need to be effectively guaranteed.\n* \t\u2022\tOur citizens have real concerns today \u2013 which we share \u2013 when the Home Office sends deportation letters or appears to defy High Court orders, as we read in the press.\n* \t\u2022\tOur position on this point has been clear since the beginning. We want to provide the strongest safeguards for the rights of citizens on both sides of the Channel. We are waiting for the United Kingdom to express the same wish.\n2/ On the financial settlement:\n* \t\u2022\tAll that is necessary in this negotiation is that everyone honours the commitments that they have made to each other. To settle the accounts. No more, no less.\n* \t\u2022\tTo settle the accounts in an objective manner, on the basis of all commitments made at 28.\n* \t\u2022\tWe want to provide \u2013 and we must provide \u2013 certainty for project managers working in Europe, such as in Italy and its regions, and in other continents, such as Africa, on the basis of the commitment of the 28.\n* \t\u2022\tBut beyond money, this is a question of trust between the 27 and the United Kingdom, based on the respect of one's signature. And everyone knows that we will need this trust to create a solid relationship in the future.\n3/ Finally, on Ireland, and the Border in particular, we must act responsibly to respect both the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the integrity of the Single Market. We are advancing, but there is still more political work to be done.\nAs I was saying, I am asking myself questions. These questions, as far as I see it, should not be controversial because this is about protecting our citizens, our businesses, our partners, and the credibility of our promises\n________________________\nCOMMENT: T.

I am not so sure that May really understands how the EU operates. Some reports today suggest May assumes that Merkel will be elected Chancellor on Sunday 24th and within days will be changing Barnier's negotiating objectives and telling all EU countries to let the UK start discussing future trade deals.  This idea could be mistaken. It is almost certain that Merkel will first be in negotiation with other parties to set up a new coalition, which depending on the outcome of the election could take some time. If Merkel then wants to change Barnier's instructions at least some show of getting all EU countries to agree new instructions would have to take place. I don't know what Mrs May can say to persuade all EU countries that \"sufficient progress\" on the  the three initial  issues has been made to move on. So far no rumours  of significant progress of any of the three issues has been reported. The UK seems to be assuming the \"outstanding liabilities\" will be settled by haggling to arrive at a figure, my take on what the EU is wanting at this stage is a list of what items that the UK accepts it is liable for, with the amounts to be calculated in due course. It is quite possible whatever Mrs May says on Friday will upset many of her own MPs, and the EU will be well aware of that.

The difficulty is that Johnson (a) implies that he would not bother with a transitional period (out of the EU but maintaining the status quo including payments) (b) would not seek a \"close\" trade deal in the long term (e.g. no Single Market, No Customs Union) but an \"arms length\"  trade  deal more similar to the EU, Japan or Canadian deals (c) would want deals with many EU institutions but would not expect to  pay anything.  This is not much different from what Mrs May said her objectives were in the Lancaster House Speech last January, but since then it has become increasingly apparent that this form of Brexit would be very damaging to the UK (businesses would need to restructure their ecosystem; currently the UK is part of a single market that has a Europe wide supply chain, if the UK is not in the Single Market and Customs Union being part of a Europe wide supply chain it is somewhere between difficult and impossible for industrial businesses, and not good for services). It is also now becoming obvious that between now and March 2019 there is not time to negotiate a bespoke trade deal (even if there is the will in the EU to do so) and not time after the outline of such a deal has been agreed, to build the infrastructure needed to operate such a trade system (goods inspection areas at ports, IT systems, recruit and train customs officers.)  \nIt had been assumed that the consensus had shifted towards a softer Brexit, and that Mrs May was likely to soften her tone in her planned speech in Florence later this week, which could have led to progress on Brexit talks. but it is now clear that the UK government it split. As far as the EU is concerned it cannot tell if any outline agreement made with the UK would survive until 2019 because no one can tell who will be running the UK government in 2019.\nJohnson's move also illustrates several aspects of his personality. Like Trump he regards facts and truth as malleable things that can be bent or stretched to fit your argument; Johnson thinks he is justified to refer to \u00a3350 million a week becoming available for the NHS or other uses, even when it is pointed out that that is not the amount that would be available to the UK. By writing the article and publishing it now, during a terrorist alert, and just before Mrs May gives a speech on the same subject, its should have been obvious to Johnson that many in government would call for him to be sacked. He must have calculated that getting sacked was risk worth taking. The way it has been described in the media, is that there only two likely outcomes, Either Boris wins and becomes PM or he losses and its the end of him. So its confirmed that Boris thinks like a gambler, place big bets and take big risks. We also know that what Boris says in his article is not a carefully considered position that he has reached after careful analysis of the facts (as he thinks facts are malleable its no surprise he takes no notice of them) but what he has concluded is a position that it is in his interest to try to sell today. It should not be forgotten that until a few months before the referendum in 2016 Johnson had not been at all sure if he would support Leave or Remain. He famously wrote two prospective newspaper columns one saying he was firmly behind Brexit, the other saying he supported staying in the EU. He chose which view to publish. Some suggested he tossed a coin, other that he calculated that saying he supported Brexit would advance his career more. No one seemed to believe any interests other than his own played any part in his decision. In fact previously his stated view was that the UK should vote to Leave the EU as a way of getting the EU to offer the UK a better deal to Remain in it (maybe he still believes that. I am sure the EU remembers his plan).  \nIt is quite possible that Boris thinks if Mrs May does sack him, he can cause trouble out of government by claiming that what ever Brexit deal May gets is worse than the deal he claims he could have got. If he is not sacked it shows that Mrs May is weak. No one seems to think Mrs May can last long as PM, so at some point in the next couple of years there will be a vacancy for leader of the Conservatives. So Johnson calculates a challenge now is in his interest. Its clearly not in the UK interest as it risks putting the Brexit negotiations back to square one.       \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/17/boris-johnson-slapped-down-statistics-chief-fresh-350m-brexit-claim"], [1034, "2017-09-18T05:09:30Z", [0.0], ""], [6303, "2017-09-18T04:18:18Z", [0.05], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [368, "2017-09-17T20:46:46Z", [0.0], ""], [919, "2017-09-17T17:06:11Z", [0.35], ""], [1034, "2017-09-17T16:41:18Z", [0.0], ""], [29145, "2017-09-17T12:49:12Z", [0.01], ""], [368, "2017-09-16T21:35:37Z", [0.0], ""], [31756, "2017-09-16T18:20:51Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2017-09-16T14:58:31Z", [0.02], ""], [37379, "2017-09-15T21:43:01Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2017-09-15T20:36:14Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-09-15T19:48:05Z", [0.0], ""], [14493, "2017-09-15T18:02:29Z", [0.1], "More evidence of total Brexit confusion and  new terminology; Davis now says there will be a period of \"acclimatization\"  possibly lasting as long as four years after Brexit in March 2019.

I assume that what Davis says is supposed to be interpreted by the listener so that they hear what they want to hear. Saying the Outstanding Liabilities had reduced to \u00a360 billion only sounds impressive to someone who thought the bill would be 100 billion Euros, but if it has been leaked that the UK would be OK with paying \u00a350 billion is sounds as if a deal can be reached, but \u00a350 billion is quite a lot higher than the nothing that Boris had suggested was appropriate.

If Mrs May continues to dither or sticks to the idea that a bespoke EU deal can be agreed with the EU, ratified by all and implemented by March 2019 I cannot see any agreement on the outstanding payments happening this year (or ever).\nEvidence for the dithering: Hammond last week was telling business that he wanted an interim period after March 2019 that maintained the \"status quo\". This implied the same relationship between the UK and EU regarding the Single Market, Customs Union, continued paying into the EU budget, continuing Freedom of Movement, continued relationship to the ECJ. Now the message has changed to \"close to the status quo\", \"a similar relationship to the Single Market, a similar but different Customs Union\", maybe, maybe not payments to the EU, maybe, maybe not some kind of sort of free-ish movement of people, but with controls.\nThe UK government is continuing to blame \"foreign\" organizations for forcing the UK to follow stupid rules, when in fact the fault is that the UK has boxed itself into problems. An example this week has been Mrs May and others blaming the OECD and saying the OECD will not let the UK spend money of hurricane relief in the Caribbean because the countries the UK wants to help are too rich. This seems to me to be exactly the sort of misleading nonsense that encouraged Brexit.  I don't believe there is any OECD rule that is stopping the UK spending money on Hurricane relief, what the rule is, is that spending money in relatively better of countries for Hurricane relief is not defined by the OECD as \"official development assistance to developing countries\". The fact that the UK wants to use money from its OECD Development aid budget to a disaster relieve budget is a problem that has been created wholly by the UK. Hardly any OECD countries comes anywhere near the recommended 0.7% of GDP fort \"development assistance\", the fact that the UK has put the 0.7% into a law is what is stopping the UK using some of the 0.7% for Hurricane relief, not the OECD. \nThis might seem a trivial matter, but it is symptomatic of the way that \"foreign interference\" in the UK has been used by UK politicians and parts of the media to push a populist agenda.  First the UK works with an international body to get an international agreement about something that is laudable. Then the UK implements an interpretation of that agreement that is very literal and allows no flexibility. Then the UK finds it is in breach of the agreement that it was instrumental in setting up. Then the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph (both papers owned by UK tax exiles) berate the \"international organizations\" for daring to tell the UK what to do, and demand that the international organizations change the rules or the UK will quit whatever international organization it is.  The game is called \"blame someone else, preferably someone foreign\". \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41274743\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4881734/Britain-BANNED-using-13billion-aid-budget.html  "], [5018, "2017-09-15T01:56:05Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T20:30:29Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-09-14T20:26:32Z", [0.0], ""], [14166, "2017-09-14T19:33:18Z", [0.07], ""], [1333, "2017-09-14T14:19:00Z", [0.15], ""], [26005, "2017-09-14T09:21:17Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-09-14T02:18:44Z", [0.02], ""], [368, "2017-09-13T20:31:45Z", [0.0], ""], [38, "2017-09-13T19:21:53Z", [0.0], "I'm wondering what GJO Admins will consider an \"agreement\".

The main person who has not admitted the reality of the UK's options is Mrs May who has been sticking to what she said in her Lancaster House speech in January which ruled out the Single Market and Customs Union.   The next round of Brexit negotiations have been postponed for a week, until after a speech that Mrs May is expected to make on 21st Sep. The speculation is that she will accept that she also wants a \"status quo\" interim period after Brexit. Presumably during this interim period the UK would continue making payments into the EU. As these payments would be taking place during the same EU budget period that the UK had already signed up to, any payments would reduce the size of that part of the outstanding liabilities that relate to the current EU budget period, making the overall Brexit bill lower.  \nI commented on the advantage of this in my post of 31st Aug. Of course Mrs May could be going to shoot Hammand down and insist that the UK does not want a \"status quo\" interim deal, but a bespoke deal. (Hammond had already suggested that a \"status quo\" deal would allow the UK to negotiate (but not sign) 3rd party trade deals.) Some in the UK might expect to get the \"status quo\" on trade but a stop to Freedom of Movement.

The psychology is very interesting. I am not a psychologist so I am wading in dangerous waters, but I can see a man who is constantly putting up obstacles to block his own progress. For example yesterday he presented a bill to parliament (The EU withdrawal bill) that was described in the parliamentary debate as an \"astonishing monstrosity\" and was heavily criticized not only by opposition MPs, but by both Pro and Anti Brexit MPs as giving a \"blank cheque\" to ministers. It appears Davis had ignored suggestions to publish a draft, which had he done so, the complained about clauses could have been amended before it got to Parliament.  Davis then decided that those pointing out what was wrong with the bill were trying stop Brexit. \nBarnier has accused Davis as going backward in the Brexit negotiations, by changing his mind on things that he had previously accepted such as that the UK would settle what it owned and that he accepted Barnier's sequence of topics (no trade talks, until the first three items had made progress) - now Davis seems to expect to move to trade talks without progressing on other matters.\nIt is difficult to see how the Brexit negotiations are helped by Davis saying that he has ruled out membership of the EEA and EFTA even as an interim, when the UK government is apparently asking for a transitional agreement that gives the UK the same relationship with the EU Single Market and Customs Union as it does now. Ignoring the question of how the EU may feel about it, it is obvious that given that 15 months have passed since the referendum with no visible progress on any Brexit deal it is unrealistic to expect to be able to negotiate, not only the Brexit leaving arrangements, but a totally new legal construction for an interim EU/UK Single Market and Customs Union and get that agreed by all 27 countries in the next 18 months. Rejecting the off the shelf options of the EEA and EFTA, Davis appears to be planing to fail to have any deal agreed by March 2019. \nWe then need to ask why he wants to slow down negotiations by creating objections to what appear to be possible solutions.

There are sharply differing legal interpretations of the \u201cBrexit bill\u201d that Britain will legally be obliged to pay in a divorce settlement with Brussels. But there are signs too of where compromise may emerge that could allow Prime Minister Theresa May deliver a headline figure more palatable to British voters than the 60 billion euros ($70 billion) widely talked about and without leaving the other 27 leaders staring at a hole in budgets. The key could be to take account of payments Britain is willing to make after leaving as part of a transition to a new cooperation pact with the bloc, EU officials and diplomats involved in negotiations told Reuters on Friday after tense talks in Brussels (para 1-4). A snag though is that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is bound by his 27 national masters not even to discuss any post-Brexit arrangements until \u201csignificant progress\u201d is made on agreeing a divorce (para 5). However, Barnier has made clear he does not need to agree any figure before asking EU leaders to launch parallel talks on the future EU-UK relationship -- possibly at a summit with May in October. He would be content with agreeing the \u201cmethodology\u201d of calculation before launching Phase Two (para 5-6). The confidential legal analysis, which British officials said rejected EU assertions that the bloc\u2019s seven-year financing plans are legally binding on member states, meant London was refusing to pay for any commitments after Brexit, Barnier said -- at odds with what May\u2019s government has previously said (para 8).

The UK just saying it does not like the EU proposal is not likely to lead to a resolution. I assume Davis might be trying to put off reaching any agreement on this or anything else, in the hope that as clock keeps running the EU will start talking about an implementation period instead. A three year implementation period, where everything stayed the same, except that the UK was technically out of the EU (out of the Commission, out of the Council of Ministers, out of the Parliament, but in the Single Market, in the Customers Union, still under the ECJ, still subject to the 4 freedoms, still paying its subs), would be convenient for Davis because most of the outstanding liabilities are commitments that the UK entered into are for the EU Budget pertiod 2014 to 2020.

For example the papers state that they do not wish to impose any measures to \"control the UK borders\", in fact they are now suggesting that it would be happy for goods and people to travel to and from the EU after Brexit with no border controls at all. The papers also suggest that in order for this to happen the UK would need to share the same product standards and rules as the EU, and elsewhere the papers reject the idea of the UK accepting any trade deals with third countries that have lower animal welfare and health standards, and that they would not accept trade deals that allowed companies to insist on being allowed to bid to supply  NHS services . These statements appear to mean that as EU laws change the UK would be obliged to change its laws to keep in step, and that any trade deal with the US (for example) would exclude several food products and bidding for healthcare provisions, areas that I had understood the US was keen to include in any trade deal. So far there is no clues as to what the UK wants to replace the role of the ECJ with. Maybe the UK is going to do the same creative thinking regarding the ECJ as it did this week with the Customs Union; leave \"the\"Customs Union, but join \"a\" Customs Union, so leave \"the ECJ\" but join \"a\" ECJ.

The UK will probably suggest that the European Court of Justice is replaced by either a court that is almost identical to the EFTA Court but with a different name and different panel of judges, or try to sell the EU on the idea that EU citizens and companies will have to trust UK courts. I doubt either idea will fly. \nThe UK says it wants to discuss post-Brexit trade deals. If that really was its prime objective it would have got on with presenting credible ideas to resolve the first 3 items on the Brexit agenda, the fact that it has spent 5 months since A50 was invoked and 14 months since the referendum and has not got anywhere close to agreeing anything suggests either great incompetence or a lack of will.

Some sources have the story as the \u00a336 billion including \u00a310 billion a year during a 3 year \"implementation\" period after the UK has officially left the EU, during this period if the UK is getting the benefits of the EU it would be expected that it would need to keep paying at the current rate.

The UK appears to want to ignore the EU sequence. As the EU seems to hold all the cards I would expect the EU to insist that its negotiating sequence is kept to. There has so far been no sign of any progress on the other two stage one issues. The UK has not yet explained how the issue of the ECJ can be got around, not how the Irish border issue can be deal with. As it has become clear that walking away from the EU with no deal would not command majority support, and that most commentators now think that there is no chance in sorting out a \"not off the shelf\" trade deal between the UK and EU by March 2019, the UE would only seem to need to wait for the UK to ask that the EU leaving date be delayed (delayed by having an \"implementation period\" of several years).  \nOf course the UK could just cave in at any time, but that would be politically difficult without another election or referendum, and I don't see either of these things happening this year.  \n"], [4918, "2017-08-06T17:25:11Z", [0.25], ""], [1092, "2017-08-06T17:16:03Z", [0.05], ""], [38, "2017-08-06T16:07:13Z", [0.5], "Thanks, @sevedb for the link.\nhttp://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/546882 May seems to have faced some realities while on vacation and is being more pragmatic."], [34918, "2017-08-06T14:38:26Z", [0.55], ""], [36739, "2017-08-06T12:20:47Z", [0.32], ""], [1639, "2017-08-06T10:27:26Z", [0.3], "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/05/uk-ready-pay-40bn-brexit-bill-eu-talks-trade/\n---------------\nCOMMENTS:  perhaps it was that summer vacation in the Dolomites that made T.

The mere fact that this debate is taking place at all is unreal. It was never remotely plausible that the U.K. and European Union could negotiate and ratify both a divorce agreement and a new free-trade deal in the two years allowed under the Article 50 timetable, let alone the 21 months remaining after Prime Minister Theresa May squandered the first three months on a snap general election. So the fact that it has taken until now for the cabinet to accept that a transitional deal will be essential\u2014even if official government policy is still that a new Brexit trade deal can be agreed by March 2019\u2014is alarming. But there is an air of unreality about the debate over the form of transition too. Only now is it finally dawning on the British political class that a transitional deal can\u2019t possibly take the form of interim membership in the European Economic Area alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Not only is the EEA outside the EU\u2019s customs union\u2014and so does nothing to shield the U.K. from one of the most damaging Brexit cliff edges\u2014but temporary membership would require a complex, time-sapping negotiation in its own right. The only transitional deal that has ever made sense is a standstill arrangement under which the EU and U.K. agree to maintain all existing rights and obligations for a limited period. This has been obvious to the EU Commission since at least November and is clearly set out in the EU\u2019s negotiating directives. Yet even now, some in the U.K. still fantasize about a bespoke interim deal that would allow the U.K. to restrict EU immigration or sign new trade deals during the transition (para. 1-5). Nixon, S.

Britain has already started negotiating with the EU over how to extricate itself from the bloc after more than 40 years of social, economic and legal integration, with an exit scheduled for March 2019. But while ministers are increasingly united on the need for a transitional arrangement to dampen the impact of exit, their opinions differ on exactly what that will involve on issues like trade and immigration, and the overall strategy remains unclear. \"There is now a window of opportunity for the government to flesh this out as a policy objective in order to reassure companies that a smooth and orderly Brexit is on the cards,\" said Allie Renison, Head of EU and Trade Policy at the Institute of Directors (para. 1-4).

Since May's failed gamble on a snap election last month, the future of Brexit has been thrown into question with squabbling between her ministers over the pace, tone and terms of Britain's departure from the club it joined in 1973 (para 1-2). Hague, also a former foreign minister, said that there was a danger that some Brexit supporters were underestimating the risks of a sharp economic slowdown or even the possible stalling of Brexit talks with the EU (para 4). \"There is the clear potential for Brexit to become the occasion of the greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the Government and the Brexit project itself,\" Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph. Hague said that an approach to Brexit was needed that made the negotiations simpler, reduced the need for rushed legislation, reassured businesses and included staying in the single market during a transition period. Hague, who campaigned to remain a member of the European Union, praised Chancellor of the Exchequer Hammond for seeking such an approach to the EU divorce. \"This is seen by longstanding advocates of leaving as a 'soft' position or a climbdown.

As part of my research I emailed someone I have known for many years who voted Leave. I explained I was doing research as part of Good Judgement forecasting, told her what GJ was about doing forecasts and gave details about who the sponsors are etc. to give her an idea about what we consider in giving a forecast I copied the \"reasons\" given by @wildwood2000  to this question, which was based on \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-idUSKBN1AD1I4\nand asked if she would be willing to answer some questions about Brexit.

We owe it to our kids to get the best deal possible which will require skill and compromise.\nYour fellow forecaster's piece and the article are both totally negative in their view point, as I would expect, as they have clearly been been written for Remain camp followers. I ask you how does this help? Pieces like this only encourage the EU to be awkward thus potentially increasing the chance of the UK negotiators being left with no option but to walk away.\"\nMy sample questions were ignored. \nI have found a similar problem with other Leave voters. I am trying to find out what sort of compromise would be possible. The Leave voters say there needs to be a compromise, but they are very unwilling to say which are their most crucial objectives, which makes arriving at a compromise next to impossible. Leave voters seem to demand that everyone has to pretend that everyone is united and so @wildwood2000 is viewed as propagandist for Remainers. (I had explained to her that most of the forecasters were not British). \nI do not believe that all Leave voters have the same attitude (one told me her reason was that she had been told blueberries would cheaper outside the EU), but there are a hardcore that are not interested in reason or reasoned discussion. They appear (but will not actually explicitly say) that they want no ECJ, no payments to the EU, no freedom of movement, but a trade deal. My guess is they expect all the compromises to come from the EU. I don't expect that will happen, which means that either there is no deal at all or the wishes of this subset of Leave voters will have to ignored, because I don't see any sign of them changing their views.\n@wildwood2000 forecast reason Brexit web tangled by spats over how to leave, Irish border Faulconbridge and Milliken (2017) July 28, states that: Britain's progress towards life outside the European Union became more entangled on Friday, with divisions deepening over Northern Ireland's border and even the type of divorce Britain actually wants.

The EU's top Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday briefed ambassadors from the 27 countries that will remain in the EU after Britain leaves in March 2019 on the outcome of the July round of the monthly divorce talks with London last week. \"He said the likelihood of starting the future relationship talks in October appeared to be decreasing,\" one EU official involved in the Brexit talks said. Britain's Brexit government department responded by saying it was confident it would make enough progress by October to move on to talks about the future relationship with the bloc (para. 1-4). But with no progress on the financial settlement except Britain's general admission that it would owe the EU an unspecified amount, and little to no real progress on other issues, the odds of a future trade relationship discussion starting in two months are declining (para. 8). \"On the financial settlement, we have been clear that we recognize the UK has obligations to the EU and that the EU also has obligations to the UK,\" the Brexit department spokesman said. EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. \"Barnier expressed concerns that sufficient progress in October looked difficult now. Mainly because Britain has no position on finances, but also because they don't have positions on other issues as well,\" a second EU official said (para. 8-11).

Last Thursday, the European Union and the United Kingdom concluded the second round of Brexit talks, which was seen to be as the full conclusion of the first leg of negotiations and was regarded as the litmus test of the general progress of the works. And, despite negotiators of both sides said days before the talks kicked off they would work to identify both \u201ctheir differences and their similarities\u201d, it seems that they made good progress just on the former. Background When last month the negotiators of the EU and the UK met for the first official round of the Brexit talks, after the United Kingdom triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the objective of the meeting was only to agree on the \u201corganisation of the negotiations\u201d, as repeatedly said by all key players involved. When the second round came closer though, it seemed clear that both sides had higher objectives and they wanted to bring home some substantial progress. At the start of the meeting, Monday last week, Britain\u2019s Brexit minister and veteran anti-EU campaigner David Davis said it was \u201ctime to get down to work and make this a successful negotiation\u201d, and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said, \u201cwe will now delve into the heart of the matter\u201d, before the two sat down for a first meeting (para. 1-2). Exit bill Another area of disagreement surely was the financial one, with the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d being the hottest topic. Michel Barnier immediately called for clarity on the British position on the financial settlement. \u201cI know one has to compromise in negotiations but we are not there yet\u201d, Mr. Barnier said. \u201cA clarification of the UK position is indispensable for us to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers\u201d, he also added. The EU\u2019s position in such a crucial matter is that Britain needs to agree a \u201csingle financial settlement\u201d, as often stated by EU negotiators, covering debts and unpaid bills after more than four decades of membership. \u201cWe know that agreement will not be achieved through incremental steps. As soon as the UK is ready to clarify the nature of its commitments, we will be prepared to discuss this with the British negotiators\u201d, EU\u2019s Barnier also commented last week (para. 6). The UK\u2019s \u201cobligations\u201d The British side acknowledged for the first time last week they have \u201cobligations\u201d to the EU, while uncertainty persisted over the size of such obligations and more. \u201cOn financial settlement we both recognise the importance of sorting out the obligations we have to one another, both legally and in a spirit of mutual cooperation\u201d, said UK\u2019s David Davis. \u201cWe had robust but constructive talks this week. There is a lot left to talk about, and further work before we can resolve this\u201d, Mr. Davis also added. However, during the Q&A at the end of last Thursday\u2019s conference in Brussels, Mr. Davis refused to give any fresh evidence of the government\u2019s willingness to compromise, as also reported by the Guardian. The EU executive has quantified the exit bill to be in a region of 60 billion euros ($70 billion) (para. 6-7). Future talks The two sides published a joint traffic lights report at the end of last week\u2019s round of talks, to show progress on 44 separate issues of contention and coloured them according to how advanced the state of play is. Out of 44 separate issues, the report shows there is an agreement on 22 \u201cgreen areas\u201d while severe disagreements on 14 \u201cred\u201d issues exist and as many as 8 \u201camber\u201d areas that need further clarification remain. Now the next round of talks is set for August 28, where progress on questions such as Northern Ireland and its borders with the Republic of Ireland is expected to be made. But, despite high hopes and expectations, Mr. Davis clearly said last week we \u201cshouldn\u2019t expect incremental progress in every round\u201d (para. 10). Motta, C. (2017).

To drive his point home, he evoked the spirit of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when she won a rebate on Britain\u2019s payments to the central EU budget, complaining that the U.K. was losing out despite being one of the biggest contributors. \u201cI will say what Margaret Thatcher used to say: \u2018We want our money back,\u2019\u201d Le Maire said, citing the 100-billion-euro figure that has been on the high end of the amounts touted. \u201cWe can always debate the amount, but the fact that the United Kingdom must pay what it owes to the European Union budget is a non-negotiable prerequisite at the start of the talks.\u201d Brexit Secretary David Davis returned to Brussels on Wednesday night and, with his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, will have lunch together and chair a meeting of negotiators who have spent the past three days thrashing out issues such as Britain\u2019s financial obligations and the rights of European citizens in the U.K. Stumbling Blocks The so-called Brexit bill has proved the biggest stumbling block, with the two sides setting out vastly different stances on how the U.K.\u2019s obligations should be calculated. The U.K. has now acknowledged that it will be on the hook when it leaves the bloc in March 2019 but hasn\u2019t gone much beyond that.

As long as there is no clear statement on what the UK want the relation ship UK-EU to look like, there is no way the negotiations can find a \"fair\" solution. For the EU-side the risk factor is the complete breakup of the union, which will happen if the UK is allowed to cherry-pick. This is the large elephant in the room. However, this means, that the acceptable outcomes (from the EU perspective) basically reduce to:\n1) some kind of hard-brexit, (including separation from the EU-justice system and subsequent agreements (Open-Skies, Euratom (both covered by the european court of justice), Free Market, Erasmus, etc.)\n2) no Brexit at all (open question: What about the current cherry-picks of the UK?)\n3) a relationship similar to Switzerland or Norway, which essentially ends up to no-Brexit but without representation I don't see a clear path to 2) but at the moment think that it's the most likely outcome.

U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU\u2019s top negotiator Michel Barnier returned to the negotiating table in Brussels for the first time since the official opening of talks on June 19, with the focus on U.K. and EU citizens\u2019 rights after Brexit and how much London must pay to cover the U.K.\u2019s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc. The two sides also are due to discuss how to manage the U.K.\u2019s border with Ireland after withdrawal, expected in March 2019. The EU has insisted progress must be made on these and other separation issues before it will consider discussing future economic ties to the U.K., highlighting the challenge of agreeing a far-reaching settlement on Brexit within the 18 months remaining for talks (para. 1-4). Despite such differences, analysts say that the two sides should be able to reach a deal on citizens\u2019 rights, but a much bigger disagreement looms over money (para. 8). The EU estimates the U.K. is on the hook for upward of \u20ac60 billion euros ($69 billion) in spending pledges made but not yet fulfilled. The prospect of payment on such a scale is political dynamite in the U.K., where advocates of Brexit won last year\u2019s referendum in part on a promise to stop sending Brussels any money at all.

A fourth set of talks, run by Davis and Barnier's deputies Oliver Robbins and Sabine Weyand, will focus on curbing problems in Northern Ireland once a new EU land border separates the British province from EU member Ireland to the south.

Today's issue concerns Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) which is a separate organisation from the EU, it is not under the control of the European Parliament, but is under the European Court of Justice. The UK gave notice in March that it was leaving Euratom when it leaves the EU, but a cross party group of MPs have pointed out that leaving Euratom will create problems in maintaining supplies of nuclear material of all types (including medical isotopes) and it appears that this cross party group has enough Conservative supporters to cause problems for Mrs May.\nThis argument provides a test of what Brexit actually means. The referendum asked if the UK should leave the EU, it did not ask if the UK should leave Euratom nor did it specifically ask if the UK should leave the jurisdiction of the ECJ. It is Mrs May who has interpreted the referendum to mean that the UK has to leave the jurisdiction of the ECJ, and it is Mrs May (possibly with legal advice from the EU) who has concluded that therefore the UK has to leave Euratom. \nThe ECJ seems to be hinge on which Brexit is swinging. All the European agreements that Mrs May wants to retain links to come under the jurisdiction of  the ECJ. To retain the links without the ECJ would seem to require that all the members of these organisations agree to the jurisdiction of a new (so far undefined) court. There seems to be no obvious advantage to any of the other 28 members of Euratom (or any of the other organisations) in charging the court and its difficult to see why they would all agree. It is far from obvious what advantage the UK would get either. It seems to be an example of where the Leave campaign has shot themselves in the foot. By claiming that its necessary to leave the jurisdiction  of the ECJ  in order to \"take back control\", it has made it impossible to have any relationship with not only the EU, but with other European organisations, without the whole of Europe agreeing to change to fit what the UK wants. There is no sign of that happening.  So either the UK must back down (which seems most likely) or its over the cliff edge. \nA very similar argument about the role of the ECJ will stop any agreement about protection of EU citizens in the UK. \nMrs May created three tests of leaving the EU. Leaving the jurisdiction of the ECJ was one. It appears that this will not be possible. That leaves two remaining tests. One concerned payments to the EU, which seems now to have been accepted will continue if the UK gets a trade deal with the EU, Which just leaves the issue of Freedom of Movement. So we seem to be back to where we were in early 2016. \nI would suggest that the Leavers picked the wrong EU institution it should have said it no longer wanted the European Parliament or European Commission not blame the ECJ for what they did not like about the EU.

But like most things the May government does they don't seem to have thought it through, because in September Germany will be in election mode and Germany. France and EU wil be just as keen as the UK is to show how tough they can be. \nMrs May is rapidly losing political control of the UK. There are daily briefing by off-message ministers contradicting each other and the official government position on whatever policy is unpopular on the day. Mrs May is now being called \"Mrs U Turn\". Mrs May needs to change direction to regain control. I have a couple of suggestions for her:-\n(a) make all votes connected with Brexit free votes. Mrs May's version of Brexit is increasingly being challenged, so rather than lurch from stubborn refusal to change her mind, to U turn, to stubborn to change her mind again, to another U turn, why not say that Brexit is a non-party political issue, it was decided by the public in a referendum so its up to the whole of parliament to interpret what Brexit means (i.e. not just her) and to implement it. That way she avoids having to make U turns and if parliament messes up, is to \"hard\" or too \"soft\" the public can blame their local MP not the PM.\n(b) address the \"people\" as a grown up. Explain that continuing austerity is a direct consequence of Brexit. Those who voted \"Leave\" have to accept that it was explained that Brexit would cost them. (I have spoken to many \"Leave\" voters who told me they would not mind being a bit poorer as long as they got back control.) Obviously as the UK has not left the EU yet, the full cost of Brexit to them is not yet known. The lower pound and higher inflation are just the foothills of the mountains the UK has to climb. There is an imbalance between the austerity suffered by different sectors of society that will need to be rectified. Therefore she should propose a reversal; that younger public sector workers will get pay rises equal to 1% less than the rate of inflation, and pension increases will be caped at 1% a year. She should say that this will be tough for everyone, but that country should remember the dark days of World War II, and how everyone suffered for freedom and that no one moaned last time rationing was required.

Faulconbridge (2017) Fri Jun 23, states that: In the year since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, the future of Brexit has been thrown into question by Prime Minister Theresa May's failed gamble on a snap general election. While both May's Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party now explicitly support leaving the club the United Kingdom joined in 1973, some of the Union's most powerful politicians have raised the possibility of Britain cancelling Brexit. Will Brexit actually happen? And if it does, how might it look? Following are some of the options. 1) BREXIT IN NAME ONLY Under this scenario, Britain leaves the EU but gets a deal that is as close as possible to EU membership (para. 1-4). 2) BREXIT NEVER Brexit doesn't happen: The $2.5 trillion economy stalls, prompting calls for a second EU referendum that - if held during a deep recession - could produce a vote to remain in the EU (para. 14). \"Many are secretly and shockingly praying for a recession: they want people weeping in the streets from economic pain so that they can have a second EU referendum,\" said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups. \"If that happened all bets would be off and we would be in a democratic and constitutional crisis in Britain the likes of which none of us have ever seen in our lifetimes.\"  If the Brexit decision was reversed by a second vote, the Article 50 notice that triggered formal divorce talks would be withdrawn, though there is no legal certainty on how, and Britain would remain a member of the EU (para. 14-17). 3) DISORDERLY BREXIT With her authority so weakened, May will have to gauge whether she can get a deal from the EU that she can sell at home (para. 26). If she thinks she will fail to get a Brexit deal through parliament, some business leaders fear she will allow talks with the EU to collapse and take Britain out with no deal. A disorderly Brexit could spook financial markets, tarnish London's reputation as one of the world's top two financial centers and sow chaos through the economies of Britain and the EU by dislocating trading relationships (para. 26-28).

But then he tells us that as \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\"  the order of the discussions does not actually matter. On that basis presumably he will not agree anything on the EU payments until after he has negotiated the famous trade deal (the one that provides cake even if you eat it), but the EU has made it clear that until \"sufficient progress\" on an agreement on the EU payments has occurred  there will be no negotiations on trade. So this questions could be settled on semantics. My view is that what the EU regards as \"sufficient progress\"  will not be a definitive agreement either to how much is to be paid nor even the exact mechanism for calculating it.

What is usually a ceremonial address, dominated by costumed pageantry, has become a critical test of May's ability to run the country during its most testing period in generations. The so-called Queen's Speech, prepared by ministers and read out by the monarch, will spell out the policies May's government intends to pursue over the next two years. It comes at a time of unprecedented political flux with May yet to secure a deal to prop up her government after a botched snap election left her short of a majority. Lawmakers will have to approve the speech in a vote, expected next Thursday, that will be a de facto vote of confidence. Minority governments are a rare occurrence in British parliamentary politics where the nature of the electoral system usually produces a governing majority. May's authority is badly damaged as Britain begins negotiations on leaving the European Union. Four militant attacks have questioned her grip on national security, and the death of at least 79 people in a tower block fire has become a flashpoint for public anger at her party's record in government. \"The election result was not the one I hoped for, but this Government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent,\" May said ahead of the speech. \"First, we need to get Brexit right. That means getting a deal which delivers the result of last year\u2019s referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support.\" The speech is expected to set out a raft of new laws needed to implement Brexit, plans to strengthen counter-terrorism powers and a series of bills designed to reform Britain's infrastructure and economy in preparation for life after the EU (para. 1-9).

Therefore, nobody on the UK side is paving the way for a smooth and successful negotiation.\n3) The EU isn't looking for a quick UK success story either.

The probabilities of the various outcomes for Brexit have certainly changed in the last week. Prior to the UK General Election it was considered anti-democratic to question Mrs May's interpretation that the public was demanding a Brexit that would mean the UK no longer allowing the Free Movement of People (within the EU), would not accept the rulings of the EU Court of Justice, and would not pay substantial sums into the EU. Many, if not most people, who had any knowledge of what these things were, considered that if the UK rules these things out there was zero chance of any substantive trade deal with the EU. Mrs May has ruled out the UK remaining in the EU Customs Union, which most people believe would be a necessity for a \"friction less trade deal\". Membership of the Customs Unions would also (appear) be required to keep an open border between the two parts of Ireland. Thus the UK's Brexit aims appeared to be contradictory (as in \"having your cake and eating it\"). \nThe election campaign and the result suggest that fewer UK voters than it was thought believe that Mrs May is capable of delivering the Brexit that she has outlined. It is also clear that many voters did not actually want the \"hard Brexit\" that Mrs May had promised to deliver, as they had voted for for parties or candidates that made it clear that they did not believe that Brexit meant no Customs Union, no ECJ, and maybe not even no Free movement of People. Mrs May will need to rely on at least one of these parties (the DUP) and one faction (the Scottish Conservatives) in order to remain PM (plus other non-believers in Hard Brexit in the English Conservative Party). So it not clear how she can cling to \"hard Brexit\".\nThe two previous Conservative PMs (as well as the two previous Labour PMs) have now all made public their views that Mrs May should not be the sole arbiter of what Brexit means. \nSo logically Mrs May will be forced to take notice of those who while accepting that the referendum said the UK should leave the EU, did not say what the UK's relationship with the EU should be. \nTherefore it appears that the UK could move toward a compromise and that an agreement with the EU could be easier. \nBut there still exists a block of true believers in a hard Brexit and until that block admits that a hard Brexit would be an economic and social disaster, will continue to claim that the only reason that the UK is being denied \"having its cake and eating it\" is that Brexit is being sabotaged by liberals globalists. Therefore the UK Government might still continue with the delusion that it is possible to reach an agreement with the EU that will give the hard core Brexiteers what they say UK voters want (but the election has shown may not be what they want). As the UK economy continues to deteriorate (compared to the US, EU and OECD) and no progress is made in made with Brexit negotiations, it would not be unreasonable to guess that most UK voters will get fed up with Mrs May's \"weak and wobbly\" leadership and demand an end to the Brexit uncertainty. A further test for Mrs May will the converting of  EU legislation into UK legislation. I am expecting that this will prove far more complex than has so far been recognized. My guess is that at some point voters will be happy to settle for the UK leaving the EU, but remaining in the Customs Union and EEA.\nThis would require almost no contentious deals with the EU, as Freedom of Movement would still exist (albeit with temporary opt outs for some zones of the UK as permitted under the rules), the ECJ would be replaced by the EFTA Court (they both use the same laws just have different judges), and EEA members are required to pay into the EEA/EU (so not much to argue about there). \nTherefore the softest option (a) cancel A50 and remain in the EU (as suggested by Macron) and the soft option (b) leaving the EU but not the EEA  would appear easy to achieve. I think one or other of these option is quite likely, what is in doubt is at what point the UK gets fed up with trying to get the unobtainable. My guess is that Mrs May will want to continue to move as slowly as possible, using the excuse that Germany is having elections in the autumn (had no one told her before she triggered A50?) \nI am not sure why Mrs May wants to go through the charade that she is going to get the hard Brexit deal she says the UK wants. I assume she is still under the delusion that UK voters think they need her to deliver what cannot be delivered. The election should have taught her that the UK voters are not as stupid as she thinks they are and very few actually believe she can deliver. (They have noticed her track record on on delivering what she says are her aims is not very good; after 7 years she (fortunately for the economy) got nowhere on reducing the net migration numbers, and has not stopped terrorist attacks, reduced the poverty gap and will probably now be blamed for the tower block fire in London). \nGetting back to the detail of the question- it remains likely that no deal on the UK EU liabilities will be struck this year. Either because the EU and UK cannot agree the figures (or even ab outline), because the UK refuses to follow the EU's sequence of what to negotiate (and therefore the EU does what it has threatened to do, spend another year producing a terms of reference for its trade negotiators.) Or the UK will have cancelled A50 or have opted for remaining in the EEA and therefore it is arguable that there is no need to calculate outstanding liabilities as it will continue making payments). \n "], [1034, "2017-06-14T05:47:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-06-13T23:41:43Z", [1.0], ""], [38, "2017-06-13T18:37:38Z", [0.33], "I'm thinking that my current forecast (14%) is too strong given the increasing uncertainty in EU countries:\n-the outcome of the election in the UK, and the recent significant weakening of May.

The big question is whether an outline agreement can be reached by the hard March 2019 deadline. The main two sticking points: the size of the UK\u2019s exit bill \u2013 reported to be \u20ac60-100 billion \u2013 and a deal on citizens\u2019 rights on both sides, including any ongoing role for the European Court of Justice. The EU wants to settle these issues before discussing any future relationship. The EU is likely to give the UK some time before beginning any formal discussions, originally scheduled for later this month. The UK\u2019s uncertain political outlook means the timetable for reaching an agreement is even more compressed, with the clock already ticking. There are now bigger risks of an economically disruptive \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit \u2013 one that leaves the UK without existing trade or security agreements by the hard March 30, 2019 deadline. But there could be a wider range of potential outcomes, including a softer Brexit in light of parliament\u2019s new makeup. The EU is willing to do a deal, we believe, but wants to draw a clear line between the benefits and responsibilities of members versus non-members. The EU has other priorities. New French President Emmanuel Macron looks poised to build on his win with a parliamentary majority that may make it easier to pass business-friendly reforms. Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are leading a revived drive to reform the EU, a bigger priority than spending energy haggling over Brexit terms.\n____________________________\nCOMMENTS:  Someone the day after the referendum told me that David Cameron will go down in history very badly.

Barnier sounded conciliatory: \"Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready,\" he tweeted. \"Timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal.\" Donald Tusk, the former Polish premier who will oversee the process as chair of EU national leaders' summits, also stressed there was \"no time to lose\" and a need for London and Brussels to cooperate to minimise disruption for people, businesses and governments across Europe when Britain walks out in 22 months. \"Our shared responsibility and urgent task now is to conduct the negotiations ... in the best possible spirit, securing the least disruptive outcome,\" said Tusk, who warned last month that emotions stirred up on either side of the English Channel during the British election campaign were jeopardizing agreement (para. 1-7).

Britons will go to the polls in a vote that will decide whether May, from the centre-right Conservatives, or Corbyn of the leftist Labour Party, gets to sit down with Brussels and hammer out an exit deal that will define the country's trade and diplomatic ties with the EU. Their differing stances could set the tone for what both Britain and the EU expect will be two years of difficult talks on everything from how much cash should be paid upon exit, to border arrangements for migrants, goods and services. May is expected to win comfortably on June 8, but her party's lead in opinion polls has narrowed sharply in the last week, calling into question her decision to call the unscheduled election seeking a strong endorsement of her Brexit strategy. One poll published on Tuesday showed her lead had been cut to 6 percentage points from 9 points a week ago and 18 points two weeks ago as voters reacted badly to the Conservatives' manifesto. The two-party leaders' differences on how to handle talks with Brussels came to the fore on Monday during the main televised event of the campaign, in which they separately fielded questions from the public and were then interviewed. \"We will be there to negotiate the right deal but what I have said is that no deal is better than a bad deal. We have to be prepared to walk out,\" she said to applause during the Sky News interview. May had previously expressed her willingness to walk away from talks, warning that Brussels could seek to punish Britain to deter other EU states from leaving by taking a hardline stance (para. 1-8).

EU BILL:\nThe net bill could look far lower than the headline payment. Some credits, such as the UK\u2019s approximately \u20ac6bn rebate from 2018, would be deducted from the gross bill almost immediately. Other reimbursements would take more time. Farm subsidies would take a couple of years, EU spending on projects could take up to 2023 and some loan repayments would take a decade or more.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/29fc1abc-2fe0-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a A CLOSER LOOK:\nTaking stock of EU liabilities at the end of 2015\n1.\tSpending commitments related to the 2014-20 MFF, and some other similar items, such as the EU budget\u2019s contribution to the \u2018Juncker investment plan\u2019; \n2.\tPension/sickness insurance liabilities related to EU employees; \n3.\tEU borrowing to finance financial assistance programmes; \n4.\tContingent liabilities. \n5.\tOther planned commitments (OPC) Liability 1: The EU\u2019s balance sheet. The obvious starting point summarising the EU\u2019s liabilities is the EU\u2019s balance sheet, published as part of the EU\u2019s consolidated annual accounts. It is based on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). At the end of 2015, the balance sheet showed assets worth \u20ac153.7, liabilities amounting to \u20ac226.1 billion, thus yielding a net liability position of \u20ac72.4 billion. Broadly speaking, the EU\u2019s balance sheet includes three types of liabilities, related to: The multiannual financial framework (MFF); The capitalised value of pension/sickness insurance liabilities related to EU employees; EU borrowing to finance financial assistance programmes. Liability 2: Outstanding budgetary commitments, or from its French name, reste \u00e0 liquider (RAL). Each line of the EU budget consists of payments and budgetary commitments for each year. Because of the different time horizons for payments and commitments, payments in a given year partly relate to commitments made in past budgets.  Liability 3: Significant legal commitments (SLC). The bulk of these commitments are amounts for specific actions (rather than general ceilings) that have been pledged in legal terms but not yet been committed in an annual budget. Since these legal commitments are only gradually expensed and committed in the budget over a long period, at a given point in time, they are not included in the EU\u2019s balance sheet or in the RAL. The consolidated accounts of the EU reported that there were \u20ac376.3 billion of such legal commitments in 2015.  Liability 4: Contingent liabilities. Contingent assets and liabilities relate to claims and obligations respectively that might arise in the future. On the asset side there is \u20ac0.4 billion worth of guarantees received, the bulk of which (\u20ac0.3 billion) is performance guarantees received from beneficiaries of funds and is contingent on meeting contractual obligations. Liabilities are far larger at \u20ac27.6 billion. Of these, EU guarantees account for \u20ac21.4 billion. This includes guarantees from the EU budget covering part or the total amount of loans made to third countries by the European Investment Bank (\u20ac19.4 billion), and smaller guarantees given in the context of other financing instruments and facilities (the EFSI portfolio, Horizon 2020, Risk-sharing Finance Facility and Loan Guarantee Instrument for TEN-T projects). The contingent liabilities also contain a sizable sum of paid competition fines that are either subject to an appeal or that could be subject to an appeal.  Liability 5: Other planned commitments (OPC) to be made in 2019-20. Possible liabilities and commitments that will be accumulated by end-2018. These include, for example, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments and administrative payments. Calculations suggest that the total value of these other planned 2019-20 commitments is \u20ac182.5 billion, will be gradually paid by annual EU budgets between 2019 and approximately 2025.\n[Source:  http://bruegel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WP_2017_03-.pdf ] THE UK:\n1.\tThe financial and related services sector accounts for 12% of U.K. GDP. London is the world's No.1 location for trading in foreign currencies.\n2.\tLondon also handles about 75% of all trade in euro-denominated interest rate derivatives. Eurozone officials are likely to push for these transactions to be conducted within the EU.\n3.\tA deal that preserves some banking access to EU markets would be a major win. A failure could cost London thousands of well paid jobs and billions in business.\n4.\tIf Britain crashes out of the EU and is forced to trade under WTO rules, automakers will face new tariffs on cars shipped to Europe, and higher costs on imported parts. Cars made in Britain get nearly 60% of their parts from outside the U.K. -- mostly from the EU -- and 56% of those cars are sold back into the EU.\n5.\t\u201dNo deal would be the very worst case for the U.K. auto industry and would put at risk the competitiveness of the industry\" said Ford's (F) European CEO Jim Farley on Wednesday. Carmakers have already sought government assurances that they will be protected if Britain leaves the EU internal market. Nissan (NSANY) is said to have received some -- although the details have never been revealed.\n6.\tAviation presents its own thorny challenges. Flights to and from the U.K. are covered by an Open Skies agreement with the EU. If no replacement deal is reached on time, flights could be grounded.\n7.\tAirlines need an agreement by the middle of next year so they can plan their flight schedules for 2019. British airlines that want to continue to operate flights within the EU, for example from Germany to Italy, face another headache. They could be forced to establish EU subsidiaries and rework their ownership structures. The U.K. is an island nation but it still shares a land border with the EU.\nThe Republic of Ireland is a member of the EU (and will remain so), while neighboring Northern Ireland is part of the U.K. Residents currently enjoy free movement across the border. Since 1985, the UK has been entitled to a financial rebate of about 66 percent of its net contribution to the EU budget in the previous year. If the UK is asked to contribute to the EU budget after Brexit in line with current budget commitments, then the UK might continue to benefit from a rebate in relation to those UK financial contributions PASSPORTING:\nGoldman Sachs expects Britain to lose financial passporting rights after Brexit.  The investment bank made the call in its latest \"Top of Mind\" note sent to clients on Monday, saying: \"Ultimately, we expect the negotiations to result in a UK-EU FTA [free trade agreement] that applies to goods but not services, and a loss of the UK\u2019s rights to financial passporting.\" Reliance on passporting would depend on whether \u201cthe firm in question is mainly operating in wholesale financial services where it can sell its services crossborder or whether it needs to connect with retail consumers. If you need to connect with retail consumers, you basically need to physically operate in the member state, and the loss of passporting rights will essentially mean that firms will need to set up subsidiaries over there.\u201d Many major non-EU banks headquartered in London already had subsidiaries in other parts of the EU.  The Association of Foreign Banks noted that banks were more or less concerned, depending on their country of origin. UK branches of EEA banks, providing both wholesale and retail services, were concerned about the loss of passporting (more so for retail services) while UK branches of non-EEA banks and UK-incorporated subsidiaries of overseas banks did not view passporting as a central issue. JPMorgan and UBS have both publicly warned they will have to move jobs elsewhere in Europe if passporting rights are lost. Goldman Sachs itself is also said to be planning behind closed doors to move 2,000 jobs to the continent if the rights are lost.\nhttp://uk.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-expects-uk-to-lose-financial-passporting-rights-post-brexit-2016-12 Passporting and equivalence:\n1.  By virtue of the UK being in the EU, financial services firms authorised in the UK are able to provide services into and within other EU Member States without the need for further authorisations. This is commonly referred to as \u2018passporting\u2019. The ability to passport services means that a firm can either provide its services directly on a cross-border basis or can establish a branch in another Member State, having received authorisation from its home state regulator and without the additional requirements and costs associated with establishing a subsidiary in that Member State. Subsidiaries, in contrast, may be subject to local governance and regulatory requirements, and may require separate capitalisation, both of which increase costs.\n2.  Passporting rights are set out in several pieces of EU legislation, most of which regulate particular activities or services. An individual firm can provide more than one of these services, so the extent to which a firm relies on passporting will vary depending on the range of its activities, with the result that the legislative regime governing a particular business can be difficult to untangle.  WTO terms:\nIn the absence of a deal with the EU the UK would fall back on WTO terms, and in particular the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Under GATS, WTO members must ensure \u201ctreatment of services and suppliers from other members no less favourable that that accorded to like services and suppliers of any other country\u201d.  NO AGREEMENT: EU PROBLEMS:\n1.\tThe EU has an AA credit rating, the second highest awarded by S&P. Previously the EU enjoyed the highest AAA rating but was downgraded shortly after the results of the UK referendum.\n2. \u201dIt goes without saying that a no-deal scenario, while a distinct possibility, would have severe consequences for EU people and EU economies. BUT, It would undoubtedly leave the UK worse off.  [M. Barnier]\n3. \"Severe disruption to air transport and long queues at the Channel Port of Dover are just some of the many examples of the negative consequences of failing to reach a deal. Others include the disruption of supply chains,\u00a0including the suspension of the delivery of nuclear material to the UK.\n4. \u201dWhile the 27 member states will find it easier to adjust \u2013\u00a0as they will still benefit from the single market, the customs union and more than 60 trade deals with their international partners,\u00a0it is in the best interests of both sides to reach a deal on the UK's orderly withdrawal from the EU.\"\n5.\tThe UK trade with the EU amounts to 46% of the UK\u2019s foreign trade. The EU-27 trade with the UK amounts to between 8\u201317% of the EU-27\u2019s foreign trade.\n6.\tNow, while the EU-27 certainly don\u2019t want to lose up to 1/6 of their foreign trade, it is hopefully obvious to anyone that if the UK were to lose up to half of their foreign trade, there is simply no phrase in the English language to describe the ensuing mayhem. UK PROBLEMS:\n1.  The 27 remaining countries of the EU will hold a lot of cards in the negotiations. A failure to engage constructively with those talks would have potentially serious consequences that would, in the long-term, cost a whole lot more than a few billion euros here and there.\n2.  If Britain does lose passporting rights it\u00a0would be a huge blow to the financial services industry. The EU's passporting\u00a0rules allow businesses to sell services across the union from anywhere within it and only require companies to be regulated in one country, rather than everywhere they operate.\n3.  5,500 companies with a combined turnover of \u00a39 billion rely on passporting in the UK, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). However, a House of Lords report in to the potential impact of Brexit on financial services, released last week, pointed out that the interconnectedness of financial services in Britain meant that many firms relied on passporting without knowing it.\n4.  It is striking that some firms do not themselves appear to be aware of their reliance on the current passporting arrangements. It would be in the interests of the firms themselves, as well as in the national interest, if they were to cooperate with the Government and the regulators to determine the true extent of such reliance, so as to inform the Government\u2019s negotiating position.\n5.  Negotiating everything on WTO terms, while Under the customs union individual Member States are prevented from introducing charges which have an effect equivalent to that of customs duties on goods; nor are they permitted to impose quantitative restrictions or quotas. The customs union also has a Common External Tariff, imposed on all goods imported from third countries.\n6.\tThe UK trade with the EU amounts to 13% of the UK\u2019s economy. The EU-27 trade with the UK amounts to about 4% of the EU-27\u2019s economy.\n7.\tWithout a Brexit deal, the British Retail Consortium said that food imported into the UK from the rest European Union will face an average of a 22% tariff.  A quarter of UK food is imported from the rest of the EU. Currently, there\u2019s no tariffs or quota on these food imports. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then the UK will apply tariffs and quotas on food imported from the EU.

EU ministers endorsed 18 pages of legally binding instructions for the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who is aiming to start formal talks in the week beginning June 19, almost exactly a year after Britain\u2019s referendum vote to leave the union. The EU stance demands the maximum possible from London on the so-called \u201cdivorce\u201d phase of the negotiation, showing little restraint on demands over financial liabilities or legacy obligations. During the ministers\u2019 discussions, Michael Roth, Germany\u2019s European affairs minister, said that the reality of Brexit\u2019s costs had yet to break through in London and that the EU27 had to brace for that moment in weeks to come. \u201cWe have two years. The clock is ticking,\u201d Mr Roth told journalists in Brussels. \u201cWe have to get down to work.\u201d In recent weeks member states have hardened the EU\u2019s stance, setting increasingly exacting requirements for Britain in the divorce stage of the negotiations to meet before trade talks can begin. Even with an election campaign in full flow in Britain, there were few signs of reservations or dissent among the 27 ministers over the aim-high approach to talks. This includes a maximalist view of Britain\u2019s financial obligations that underpins an estimated exit bill of \u20ac55-75bn in net terms, covering everything from the costs of moving London-based EU agencies to EU farm payments in 2019 and 2020. In gross terms, the EU has raised its opening demand for Britain\u2019s Brexit bill to up to \u20ac100bn.

In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs. May reiterated a longstanding British position that reaching agreement over the terms of Britain's exit and its future relationship with the EU must be done together. \"I'm very clear that at end of the negotiations we need to be clear not just about the Brexit arrangements--the exit, how we withdraw--but also what our future relationship is going to be,\" Mrs. May said on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Asked if that meant the U.K. wouldn't agree to settle any divorce bill until all negotiations are finished, including those covering trade, Mrs. May said: \"The EU itself has said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" The EU, which on Saturday set out its core positions on Brexit after a summit of leaders, wants a phased approach to negotiations in which Britain agrees to settle its outstanding liabilities to the EU and other divorce issues before talks turn to trade. The EU calculates the U.K. could owe it EUR55 billion to EUR60 billion ($60 billion to $65 billion) to settle commitments made to the EU budget but not yet paid. Several leaders expressed frustration with the U.K. government, saying it hadn't fully understood the importance of settling the divorce issues before moving on to talks on the U.K.'s future relationship with the bloc. \"I have the impression that these phases--phase one separation, phase two future relationship--are not clearly understood by some in the U.K.,\" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She said talks will move on to the next phase only if all 27 EU leaders agree there is sufficient progress in divorce talks. EU officials said Saturday the British government still seems to believe that, on the issue of the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K., it would be enough to secure a broad agreement promising fair treatment when, in fact, the EU wants a detailed deal in place. \"I have the impression sometimes that our British friends...do underestimate the technical difficulties we have to face,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said. \"The single and not simple question of citizens rights is in fact a cortege of 25 different questions which have to be solved. So this will take time.\" Mrs. May acknowledged Sunday that Brexit talks will be tough, but said she is confident the two sides can reach a deal (para. 1-10). Douglas, J., Norman, L. & Pop, V.

At Saturday's Brussels summit of the 27 other EU states, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker accused unnamed pro-Brexit figures of underestimating the complexity of the task and German Chancellor Angela Merkel repeated her concern that London still harbored \"illusions\" about negotiating a quick free-trade pact. May, who has called an election for June 8 in the hope of strengthening her position, repeated her insistence that no deal would be better than a bad deal -- a position many in Brussels view as bluff, arguing that the legal void that would dawn on March 30, 2019, would hurt Britain much more than the others. But Juncker, quoted on Sunday by Germany's FAS newspaper, highlighted growing fears that the two sides are talking past each other, raising a significant risk of negotiations collapsing. \"I\u2019m leaving Downing Street 10 times more skeptical than I was before,\" the Frankfurt paper quoted the European Commission president as saying after he and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier met May in London over dinner on Wednesday. Juncker had arrived hefting two weighty EU treaties -- last year's 1,600-page CETA free-trade pact with Canada and the 2012 EU accession of the bloc's newest member, Croatia (population 4.2 million). They were props to convince May of the complexity of unwinding 46 years of EU membership and keeping trade open. So alarmed was he at what he said on Saturday were British officials who \"underestimate the technical difficulties\" that he alerted Merkel, the EU's main power broker, in an early morning call to Berlin on Thursday. She then used a speech in parliament to warn against British \"illusions\" that it could retain much of the benefits of EU membership after Brexit (para. 1-8). James, W. & Macdonald, A. (2017).

It seems the EU will have much the stronger position in the talks, and increases the chance that they can push through their demands, including the agreement on the Brexit bill.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters on Saturday, after a Brussels summit where EU leaders approved instructions for their negotiator, that Britain had blocked billions of euros (dollars) in EU spending last week. \"It would be desirable and it would facilitate the beginning of the negotiations if the UK were to be able to withdraw the reserve it has entered,\" Juncker said, referring to talks on Britain's 2019 exit from the EU. They are expected to begin after a parliamentary election on June 8, which Prime Minister Theresa May called this month hoping that an increased majority will strengthen her position. British officials said it was due to the election that its diplomats informed the EU on Tuesday that they could not approve a package of some 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in spending measures on Wednesday, out of respect for the pre-vote \"purdah\" when ministers hold off deciding on \"sensitive issues\". A British official said: \"This has nothing to do with a change in position. We sought to delay a vote on a sensitive file in keeping with our pre-election protocol.\" However, EU officials were not convinced, saying the veto appeared unprecedented and affected policies that Britain had agreed during months of prior deliberation: \"This is clearly not a technical decision,\" one said. \"It could be a show of force.\" Among measures affected was 2.5 billion euros for bolstering EU frontier controls to deal with the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean and 1.4 billion euros to tackle the \"root causes\" of migration in poor nations -- a policy Britain strongly backs. Further spending on youth employment initiatives, student exchanges and scientific research were also hit. The move was seen as a poor omen in Brussels for two years of difficult talks on a tight timetable.

At a Brussels summit marked by unusual harmony among the 27 leaders, there was a flash of the cross-Channel acrimony which some fear could wreck any deal when officials accused London of cynically vetoing some EU spending and demanded it back down or face disrupting the start of talks next month. Meeting for the first time since Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the two-year countdown to Brexit in late March, her counterparts took just minutes as they sat down to lunch in Brussels to approve eight pages of negotiating guidelines hammered out by their diplomats over the past month. They greeted the decision with applause, officials said. The text will bind Michel Barnier, their chief negotiator, to seek a deal that secures the rights of 3 million EU expats living in Britain, ensures London pays tens of billions of euros Brussels thinks it will be owed, and avoids destabilizing peace by creating a hard EU-UK border across the island of Ireland. \"We are ready,\" Barnier said. \"We are together.\" With Barnier expecting to launch negotiations after the June 8 election May called to strengthen her position, the EU leaders also firmly ruled out discussing the free trade deal May wants until they see \"significant progress\" on key withdrawal terms. \"Before discussing the future, we have to sort out our past,\" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters. He criticized British politicians -- who have included May herself -- for speaking of a quick deal to reassure expatriates when the legal complexities required much more detailed talks. \"We need a serious British response,\" Tusk said (para. 1-10).

Saturday\u2019s summit is the first official gathering of the 27 EU leaders without Britain since May sent a letter formally triggering the Article 50 withdrawal process in late March. Diplomats said the concerns were tied directly to a dinner that May hosted in London Wednesday night with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, and other senior officials. Participants in the dinner were extraordinarily tight-lipped about it afterward, but an EU diplomat said Juncker called Chancellor Angela Merkel at 7:30 a.m. the day after the dinner. And in a speech to the German parliament on Thursday, Merkel sent a pointed wake-up call, saying the U.K. \u201ccannot and will not have the same rights\u201d as EU members and that Britain should have \u201cno illusions.\u201d May, responding to Merkel\u2019s comments, said that the 27 \u201cwere lining up to oppose\u201d the U.K., and she noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that actually there will be times when these negotiations are going to get tough.\u201d One senior EU official said there was some relief that even hard-line Brexiteers were no longer suggesting that leaving the EU without a formal withdrawal agreement might be a good idea. Officials on both sides generally agree that would lead to chaos.

The demands are contained in a paper, seen by Reuters on Thursday, that outlines \"key elements\" of directives for Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, who will launch talks on a Brexit treaty after Britain holds a general election on June 8. Prime Minister Theresa May has put ending \"free movement\" of workers from other EU states, budget contributions to Brussels and oversight by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) among central planks of her plans for leaving the European Union, due to happen in March 2019 after a two-year negotiating period. But in language that echoes a tough line taken by the 27 other EU leaders who will endorse a common position at a summit on April 29, the paper spells out Brussels' aim to protect the rights of 3 million EU citizens living in Britain, extract cash from London to cover a wide range of existing commitments and ensure EU judges can hold Britain to the treaty after Brexit. It does not put a figure on what Britain might owe -- May's ministers dismiss an estimate of 60 billion euros ($64 billion) floated by the EU -- but said the exit treaty should both set a \"global amount\" to honor financial obligations, subject to later adjustments. It will be fixed in euros, not pounds. And there would also be \"a schedule of annual payments\". That would reflect the fact that loans and guarantees made by the EU while Britain is a member extend well beyond 2019. During this transition period, rules would be enforced by the ECJ, the paper states, in one of numerous references to the Luxembourg judges' continuing role in Britain. It said the EU might consider an \"alternative dispute settlement\" system for the treaty, but only if that was \"equivalent\" to the ECJ. In a particularly pungent demand in a week where Brussels has slapped down London's claim that it might hang on to two EU agencies based in the capital, the paper says Britain should \"fully cover ... costs\" related to moving them and any other EU bodies to member states staying in the bloc (para. 1-9).

As such, it's difficult to take an 'outside' view on this. Michel Barnier, the EU's lead negotiator, has stated he wants to take a 'step by step' approach. According to this article in the FT, these steps are: \"disentangling past ties and commitments; setting goals for future relations; and arranging transition terms to avoid unnecessary disruption. Each one could take between four and eight months.\" https://www.ft.com/content/bd046284-1464-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76 I take it that reaching \"an agreement on payment of the UK's oustanding liabilities to the EU\" relates to step 1, \"disentangling past ties and commitments\". Theresa May has called a general election for 08/06/2017. It is likely she will win with an enhanced majority (80%). It is unlikely (5%) that any substantive negotiations will take place prior to the election. Assuming she immediately starts negotiating on the first step, and assuming the EU co-operates, and using the midpoint of the FT estimate of 4 to 8 months, the agreement will be finalised approximately 6 months after the 08/06/2017 date. So that gives an agreement date of 08/01/2018, with a variance of plus or minus two months. However, given the unprecedented nature of the negotiation, my bias would be to assume that it is more likely it will be delayed than that it will be brought forward. Factors that might cause it to occur prior to 01/01/2018 include:\n1) Theresa May's desire to frontload 'bad news' i.e. get it out of the way as early as possible within her electoral cycle. This assumes the bill will be significant, which given the weakness of the UK's bargaining position is likely.\n2) Theresa May's (and the UK's) desire to get the first step out of the way quickly to enable a swift progression to the next two steps in Barnier's timetable, given that there is a risk of dropping out of the end of the 2 year negotiation window into WTO rules. Factors that might cause it to be delayed until after 01/01/2018 include:\n1) Intransigence on producing an agreed formula by either negotiating partners prior to the midpoint of the time estimate. (I have a suspicion that with a healthy majority in parliament, TM may actually find it easier to weather bad news on this front than otherwise. That said, the EU side have made it clear that the UK will be worse off out of the union than inside it. Whether this is meant in terms of general trading arrangements or not remains to be seen.)\n2) Unexpected events. Literally anything that causes problems in the negotiations. Given the unprecedented nature of this, and given that the stronger negotiating side has time on its side, it is likely there will be delays.\n3) I hear people in Europe like to take long holidays in August. If I were in their position, I would basically halt serious negotiations in late summer. I don't know how the Christmas/New Year holiday element will effect things. I suspect TM will want to delay bad news until after the Christmas/New Year holidays anyway. The mid-point estimate is just after 01/01/2017, and I think the factors in favour of a further delay are likely to be greater than the factors in favour of an accelerated agreement. So I'm going with 15% Yes.

Since both positions have staked a positive outcome for this phase (formally phase 1 where the parameters on the negotiation - on the EUs end) of the negotiations will depend on a number of aspects:  the probability and likelihood of an outcome that favors the completion of all phase 1 aspects including location of the negotiations;  the policy distances between the two entities relative to specified deliverables of the negotiation framework will influence, as a function time, will determine progress in this phase.

The ability of each agent to address uncertainty through intelligence activity, adds additional uncertainty due to random noise in the interactions among agents.

European Council President Donald Tusk said there must be a \u201cphased approach\u201d and no trade talks could begin until autumn at the earliest. And this was on the condition \u201csufficient progress\u201d had been made on settling the \u00a350billion divorce bill and \u00adguaranteeing the status of EU \u00adcitizens. Mr Tusk said the EU did not want to punish the UK as Brexit \u201cis punitive enough\u201d (para. 1-3). EU'S FOUR KEY DEMANDS 1. EU citizens (para. 10). What the EU wants: There are three million EU citizens in the UK and more than one million Brits in EU countries. Brussels wants assurances on EU nationals\u2019 ability to work in the UK and their welfare and healthcare rights. Will the UK agree? Britain wants to protect UK nationals living overseas so will be keen to do a deal. Key issues are how EU nationals prove right of residency, the rights they\u2019ll be entitled to and the cutoff date for free movement. 2. \u00a350billion bill What the EU wants: The EU wants a single settlement covering agreed contributions to Brussels budgets to 2020. This could be \u00a350billion. Will the UK agree? Mrs. May says we\u2019ll honor obligations but she is under pressure from Tories not to pay a penny. The figure could be lower if the UK can claim for EU assets it has helped finance over 40 years. Agreeing a bill would smooth the way for trade talks but Mrs May would face a backlash. 3. Legal assurance What the EU wants: At present hundreds of firms trading with the UK are covered by EU-wide laws. Brussels wants to ensure there will be no cliff edge beyond which firms can no longer operate. For example, a German airline insured in London will want to know a policy is valid after 2019 (para. 10-19). Beattie, J.

European leaders have warned the UK that it will face a divorce bill of up to \u00a350billion for outstanding commitments and pension liabilities. However, The Telegraph understands that officials are currently drawing up a register of the UK's assets in the European Union as part of negotiations. It comes after an influential Lords' committee concluded that the Government is not legally obliged to pay Brussels anything. A Government source said: \"This is being presented in a binary way as a divorce bill, in which we owe them. It's not like that. It's more like leaving a gym or a club. You don't continue to pay for other people to use the facilities after you leave\" (para. 1-6). It comes after the European Union made a significant climbdown in the wake of Theresa May triggering Article 50 and formally starting Brexit negotiations. (para. 11). European leaders conceded that the EU and the UK do not have to reach an agreement on the divorce bill before Brexit talks begin.\nEastern European leaders also said that they regard the bill as a \"technical issue\" that of secondary importance to securing the migrant rights. Henry Newman, Director of Open Europe said: \"That balance sheet must consider not just the UK\u2019s commitments, but also its share of EU assets and claims. This could include things like a proportion of EU property (embassies and official buildings), EU future spending earmarked for the UK, as well as cash and potentially loans (para. 11-15).

In other words the UK does not want to agree a framework for leaving before it has agreed a framework for its future relationship. It is viewing the negations as all being part of one transaction.  Clearly there is a difference of opinion between the EU and UK, but I don't see how the EU can insist of the UK agreeing to the EU order of events unless the matter is decided in the EU's favour by the ECJ. I am not a lawyer but A50 does not seem to clearly support the idea that the leaving framework has to be agreed before starting the future relationship discussions. \nUnless someone has got a secret plan that will please everyone in the EU, and the UK, and is completely uncontroversial it seems unlikely that much will be decided before the next German Government is in place. It has been suggested that going by previous German elections and negotiation about forming coalitions, the next German Government will not be in place until November of December 2017. I doubt that this would give time to agree this question before Jan 2018.\nI don't see the EU being in a great rush to speed up the timetable, particularly as there  have reports that the EU is concerned that the UK might be planning to withdraw A50 just before the March 2019 end date if it has not completed the leaving talks and immediately invoke A50 again to get another 2 year period for more negotiations. This may or may not be true, but the fact that some in the EU think it may be true gives an idea of how unlikely they think having a deal in place in the 2 years is. \nIn my view there are three possible outcomes to Brexit\n (a) the EU offers and the UK accepts a deal that is more or less the Norway (EEA) deal - this could be done in 2 years \n(b) there is no deal at all - in which case the economic outlook for the UK in at least the short term (10 years) will be very bad, and bad for the EU\n (c) a special bespoke deal that is nothing like any other deal that the UK has done with any other country - this would take between 5 and 10 years to put in place.  Option (b) means everyone loses and I don't think the public will thank the politicians for making them a lot poorer (for at least 10 or 20 years). Option (c) is so complex that the UK will have had several changes of government before it is up and running, so I suspect it would just not happen.  Option (a) is not what many in the Leave camp wanted, but it might be what the UK public will settle for after 3 or 4 years of unproductive negotiations. Therefore I think the EU will aim for (a) and string out the negotiations until the UK public is fed up with having a declining currency and economy.  \nhttp://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html"], [12879, "2017-04-08T15:46:50Z", [0.05], ""], [1389, "2017-04-08T15:20:05Z", [0.05], ""], [29502, "2017-04-08T13:48:19Z", [0.0], ""], [11096, "2017-04-08T13:01:25Z", [0.02], "Using IPCC scale of likelihood I start with 2 % as somewhere between unlikely (0-10%) and very unlikely 0-1%\nRationale: British government is totally not ready to understand the changes in all legislation when leaving the EU.

In effect, that leaves around two months.  It's not obvious that the UK and EU will share a common understanding on what the liabilities might constitute, or how they should be calculated.  Additionally, there is no compulsion for this to be determined (at least as far as the UK is concerned) until - later in 2018, anyway (to allow ratifications by each member state and the European Parliament before the UK's departure date of 29 March 2019).  And the EU structure means that it lends itself only to  unwieldly and slow-moving processes of decision-taking.   On the other hand, both sides seem to have a vested interest in this being resolved relatively quickly (for all that formal agreement will only finally be confirmed when all the terms relating to the UK's departure are signed off - much later on in 2018). In principle, some of the work and rationale behind this may have been taking place, behind the scenes, on both sides, since the UK's decision to leave the EU became apparent in June 2016. So some preliminary understandings, on each side, may have been reached. Have there been back-channel informal discussions between representatives of both sides?
