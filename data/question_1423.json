To answer the question on Maduro's continuation after 01 June 2020, there are 3 possibilities: 1) Another successful coup - In the last 7 years, there were 2 coup attempts ( the two being consecutively in the last 2 years). Hence, the probability of executing another coup immediately and successfully is very low, but this choice can't be eliminated (20%).  2) Successful popular uprising - With economy in the doldrums and frustrated by the pandemic, this possibility may not be ruled out. However, there is a higher chance (40%). 3) Peaceful negotiation and democratic process - Maduro may announce a democratic election to improve the confidence and suppress any popular uprising (40%). Without any indicator for choices 1 and 3, the forecast depends upon the past occurrence and intuitive probabilities of each choice.

Arrested/Detained 1.\nThe 2018 August 4th assassination attempt on Maduro shows that he is vulnerable. However, it would likely make him bolster his security and force more caution e.g. foiled plot in 2019 [1]. Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis makes public appearances much less likely and limits opportunities (only contact with his inner circle). However, Venezuela reacted quickly to the outbreak and have fewer cases compared to their neighbors. The numbers must be taken with a grain of salt, but they definitely did act early and this may shorten its impact. However, second waves may become more likely if you recover faster than your neighbors. Civil unrest will rise as the conditions worsen, increasing the incentive for his assassination. 2.\nFound no evidence to suggest Maduro is suffering from any health issues. COVID-19 does increase his chances of death but even if he gets it, he is 57 and should be fine. 3.\nDuring COVID-19 this is unlikely, especially during the peak stage of the outbreak. He recently consolidated some power with no repercussions (judicial killings). I spoke more about Guaido and opposition in another forecast. 4.\nLast month the United States offered $15 million for any information leading to the arrest/conviction of Maduro. This does increase the chances of his arrest. It will also increase the chances of a member of Maduro's close circle giving intelligence or staging a coup, especially if his position becomes more precarious as the COVID-19 crisis, economic crisis and oil crisis plays out in full. The situation could become so bad that his most powerful domestic ally, the army, starts to defect and he is arrested or murdered in a violent coup. Overall, I believe Maduro's chances of remaining as president by June 1st are very high. The COVID-19 situation will place him behind closed doors for the majority of the next two months. Coups and desertions are catalysed by mass protests, and mass protests usually take time to become \u2018mass\u2019. However, this situation is unprecedented, and things may move very quickly.

Russian support. It is unlikely that the Russian government wants to lose faith by abandoning the Maduro regime less than a year after declaring support. More than mere support for the Maduro regime, the Russian government has geopolitical, financial, and military interests that mitigate against allowing the regime to collapse.  2. Collapse of a viable opposition. Several news outlets reported on 10 March that opposition protests, led by Juan Guaido, were easily contained. This suggests that no new divisions have appeared within the security apparatus, and that the opposition is being contained to a symbolic protest. Another element to consider here is that the outbreak of coronavirus gives the regime legitimate reasons for banning further large-scale protests, which could diminish any momentum they may have had been gathering.   A few factors that could tip the scales:  1. The price of oil. Government revenues depend on revenues from oil, and worldwide oil prices have plunged due to the price war between Russian, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This will undoubtedly put pressure on Venezuela to find revenues to pay its security services. 2. The coronavirus. The coronavirus and cases of COVID-19 will tax an already depleted healthcare service, and could rekindle widespread anger toward the regime.  Conclusion: It is unlikely that Maduro will be ousted in the given timeframe. The 10 March demonstrations reveal that the security services are still controlled by Maduro. Moreover, Maduro has done nothing to fall out of favor with the Russians. Thus, Maduro has strong support that is unlikely to rapidly diminish.  It is uncertain what pressures the coronavirus will introduce, but it is easily conceivable that the US could be blamed for an inadequate state response (given the sanctions imposed). The Russian government is also helping Venezuelan oil to reach markets in spite of sanctions, which allows Maduro to pay off his security services. Therefore, the two most disruptive forces acting against the regime do not seem adequate to cause a change in the status quo.

Maduro won the election but the opposition and a significant part of the international community cried foul. Organising a new presidential election takes time. Nothing indicates that Maduro seeks an election. Even if an election is held it is not sure it would result in Maduro ceasing to be the president of Venezuela. No actor has the capacity to force a presidential election upon Maduro. Estimated likelihood 1%. B.\tCoup d\u2019etat\nAttempts to rally the population and the military behind overthrowing Maduro has failed. The large majority of the military remains loyal to Maduro, even though there has been some defections. Forces from Cuba and Russia are on Venezuelan soil and supports Maduro. In theory a coup does not require a large military force, hence the capacity might exist as well as the intention. Of all the coup attempts in the world since 2010 few has been successful. Estimated likelihood 4%. C.\tDeath/ sickness\nMaduro is 57 years old. He is overweight. Life expectancy in Venezuela is 74 years (2016). Cuba has sent doctors to Venezuela. That Maduro would become incapacitated or die from natural causes before 1 June 2020 is therefore unlikely. Estimated likelihood 1%. D.\tSteps down voluntary\nMaduro has shown no signs of wanting to step down as a sacrifice for the greater good. This might become an alternative, nevertheless, if he loses the support of Russia, Cuba or from the military top brass. Hence, there are actors with the capacity to force him to step down, but the intention is lacking. Estimated likelihood 3%. E.\tForeign military intervention\nMost of the neighbouring countries have ruled out intervening to overthrow Maduro.  Planning a military intervention takes time, and the only foreign power with the power to oust Maduro, USA, has an administration with a policy of reducing the global military footprint. Estimated likelihood 1%. Conclusion\nAlternatives A-E add up to a 10% likelihood that Maduro will cease to be president of Venezuela before 1 June 2020.

Currently, 54 countries recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3 while China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey support Maduro.  Of note, Putin has deepened Russian involvement in Venezuela to keep Maduro in power (https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/russias-intervention-in-venezuela-whats-at-stake/), which decreases the likelihood of Maduro being ousted.  The U.S. would need to do more than sanctions to oust Maduro, and the US is unlikely to do so, especially with the upcoming elections.  As a result, I'm decreasing the forecast to 9%.

This question is appears to asking if Maduro will lose control of the central portion of the military/government that allows him to use state resources.  Thus far external pressure (economic) has not been able to shake Maduro out of the capital; however, in a country that has been destabilized and fractured like Venezuela change can come quickly.   Most press reports indicate the population that is capable of leaving has probably left (about 3 million over the last few years).  Those who remain continue to persist in a semi-stateless environment relying on external sources for cash, trade, and security.  There is little incentive for most of these elements to actually seek to control the government.  Internal opposition led by Guaido wants to take control, but they appear to have little in the way of means to achieve that end.  The question devolves to - how long can Maduro continue to pay supporters or how many supporters fear for their own security if Maduro is deposed?   Maduro has used state resources and will continue to use those resources to pay for his supporters.  Ceasing payments / an inability to pay before June appears very unlikely.   Supporters who fear for themselves will support to the end... The question is how many?
