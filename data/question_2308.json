This averages out to a daily return of ~0.22% or an annualized return of ~55% over the period in question. At this point I feel pretty comfortable asserting that the bottom is in on the S&P correction and NASDAQ bear market. It seems clear the indices have rebounded off their low and had a pretty significant relief rally in the recent week or two. This bottom appears to have happened in tandem with peak fear around the FED raising rates at the March meeting and the conflict in Ukraine. Both of which the market seems to be coming to terms with; and it seems it was not as bad as the market had priced in. I would expect both indices to reach a new ATH before a lower low at this point. The question in my mind is then if the recovery will occur fast enough for the new ATH to occur before the deadline. While 4% is certainly within reason if the NASDAQ recovery continues at it current rates, I would expect the NASDAQ rally to hit a little bit of a wall as it approaches it's 100 Day SMA and 200 Day SMA around ~14750. If there is some catalyst (Resolution to Ukraine crisis, inflation naturally reverting to more normal historic level, significant earnings surprises to the upside, etc.) than I think the indices easily push through this level and should comfortably hit the ATH before the deadline. That said, if we do not get any significant news I see the NASDAQ rally slowing naturally. If Tech stalls, then I think it would be difficult for the S&P to continue it's rise unless there is significantly more juice to squeeze out of the energy trade that has been ongoing this year. With how high global oil prices have been this also seems pretty unlikely to me. While it is certainly within the realm of possibility, I think we still need one really good piece of good new to serve as a catalyst to overcome the key price levels we are approaching. If this does not happen then I think we trade sideways for a while. Meaning while I think ATHs are coming, without that spark I don't think we hit them before the deadline.

(April 2020, ~$2500 to ~$2900 for monthly increase of ~14%). This means for this to return to all time highs we would need to have reason to believe a similar reversal is about to happen. Digging into the components a bit we can see this sell off has largely been driven by a large sell off in Mega-cap and high growth technology names. With Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Tesla, NVIDIA, Facebook, and Netflix making up ~25% of the index themselves (Companies that are all massively off their highs) it seems any chance the index has to try and recapture all time highs must involve these Mega-Cap tech stocks to rebound quickly in a return to a market wide risk-on approach.  While recent volatility to the downside would suggest market mechanics could lead to a drastic reversal (ie Derivative traders caught offside by a reversal may need to cover their shorts), this would still need to triggered by some event to clearly display the market has gotten too pessimistic on Mega-cap and Growth tech. The things I could see as a potential spark to trigger this would be one or some combination of something along the lines of:\na) Rapid resolution in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict\nb) Central Banks surprising the market by keeping rates lower longer, unwinding already priced in rate increases\nc) Energy markets collapsing in price, driving a rotation back out of Energy and back into Mega-cap Tech sparking a risk-on mood.\nd) Rapid resolution to rising inflation\ne) Escalating conflict in other countries make investment riskier and a flight to safety effect to drives money to the American markets\nf) Some other major event Overall, the recent environment would seem ripe for a reversal provided with the right spark. However, there would need to be a drastic event happen very soon for the reversal to have enough time to recover the needed 12%.
