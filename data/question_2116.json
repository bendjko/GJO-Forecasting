The fastest rate of net hiring in a single month not counting 2020 or 2021 was 101k, and July had a relatively normal 29k net hires, so it seems unlikely that the very high net hiring rates of e.g. this June will repeat, and since they'd need to repeat at least twice to saturate the market before November, most likely the number of openings will not decrease below typical numbers for the year (post winter covid surge) to date, probably close to spring or July numbers. Given the lead time in creating new businesses, and the tight labor market, it's hard to see a scenario where the number of openings is driven by something other than rate of hiring (e.g. creation of lots of new shipping businesses generating a very high number of job openings), so the 1.6-2.0 million range looks like the best bet by far."], [101422, "2021-09-08T07:07:43Z", [0.14, 0.15, 0.46, 0.19, 0.03, 0.03], ""], [55722, "2021-09-07T18:47:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2], ""], [100273, "2021-09-07T13:14:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.6], "On the line."], [1333, "2021-09-06T20:53:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.11, 0.85], ""], [102430, "2021-09-06T19:41:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.4, 0.45, 0.1], "More people are losing unemployment checks and could be looking to get back to work.
