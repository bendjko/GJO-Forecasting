charter changes towards shifting to a federal system of government has unanimously approved an amendment to the provision cited above: adding \u201clawless violence\u201d to invasion and rebellion as another reason for the imposition of martial law. Retired Lt. Gen. Ferdinand Bocobo, a con-com member, said he suggested the amendment in view of present challenges to national security posed by \u201cterrorism and violent extremism\u201d to which, he added, acts of lawless violence are related. Replying to a question, he claimed that \u201csimultaneous or large-scale\u201d attacks by the New People\u2019s Army would be enough reason for the President to impose martial law. \u201cFor NPA attacks to fall under \u2018terrorism\u2019 as ground to declare martial law, these attacks should cause widespread and extraordinary fear and panic among the populace,\u201d he explained.

The bill means that Mindanao (Southern Philippines) mostly populated by Filipino-Muslim residents and home to Abu Sayaff, Moro International Liberation Front (MILF) as well as some various ISIS sympathizers could mean that self-proclaimed power by Islamic loyalist as well as MILF political umbrella could potentially run the entire Southern part of the country. In contrast, this could also mean a peaceful process and develop a small provincial government run by the local Islamic and MILF personnel. The potential that a full blown martial law for the entire country is less likely since Manila, and Visaya (Central part of the country) are predominantly Roman Catholic and remains a powerful player in Philippine government as well as local governments around the country.

So it seems that Duterte is more likely to respond to large scale terrorist attacks with martial law compared to smaller scale ones. Now, looking at terrorism trends worldwide.... In 2016, there were a total of 11,072 terrorist attacks worldwide. Of those attacks, 55% of attacks occurred in Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines (11,072/365=30.33). This is equivalent to having 30 terrorist attacks worldwide per day in one year. In 2015, there were 12,121 terrorist attacks worldwide. So the number of attacks has shown a decline since 2015. Of these 11,072 terrorist attacks in 2016, 482 were in the Philippines (482/11072= 0.0435). But in 2015, of 12,121 terrorist attacks, 490 of them were in the Philippines (490/12,121=0.0404), which shows that the rate of terrorist attacks in the Philippines has not declined dramatically compared to the worldwide results. So that means, on average, ((482+490)/2=486) there are about 486 terrorist attacks in the Philippines each year (in the past two years), which is about 1.3 terrorist attacks a day. So far, Duterte has been in office for a little over a year. Assuming the trend of terrorist attacks continues (here I am using the 2016 value for this estimate because the 2017 data is not available/I cannot find it), that means that only 1 out of the 482 attacks has incited Duterte to declare martial law (1/482=0.002). So the probability of having a terrorist attack in the Philippines and having an attack elicit martial law is 4%*0.2%=0.8%: +1% https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/272485.pdf So far, I predict a 10+5+1=16% chance of Duterte proclaiming martial law nationwide.  Legislators have voted to extend martial law in Mindanao to continue addressing the Islamist insurgencies. Although, Duterte has claimed that the city is now liberated (Oct 17). Government forces have allegedly killed the insurgents leader. Yet, this 5 month fight shows that that a relatively small militant group can keep government forces pinned down, which could inspire other militant groups into action in the future.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/world/asia/philippines-marawi-fighting.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FPhilippines&action=click&contentCollection=world&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection Yet, most Muslims live in Mindanao, so it is likely that most of the terrorist attacks will be isolated to that region of the Philippines, in which Duterte might keep martial law isolated to that region."], [368, "2017-10-18T20:48:08Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-18T20:23:33Z", [0.23], ""], [368, "2017-10-17T19:52:03Z", [0.0], ""], [39911, "2017-10-17T17:39:50Z", [0.75], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T21:58:26Z", [0.23], ""], [368, "2017-10-16T20:46:26Z", [0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-10-16T04:16:14Z", [0.07], ""], [691, "2017-10-16T00:38:53Z", [0.24], ""], [1034, "2017-10-15T19:36:11Z", [0.0], ""], [83, "2017-10-14T23:12:03Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2017-10-14T21:25:06Z", [0.25], ""], [368, "2017-10-14T17:29:10Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-14T13:23:42Z", [0.26], ""], [23234, "2017-10-14T05:47:21Z", [0.09], ""], [368, "2017-10-13T23:49:10Z", [0.0], ""], [4273, "2017-10-13T22:58:28Z", [0.18], ""], [691, "2017-10-13T19:42:20Z", [0.28], "He will make sure his current kinder-gentler gesture is a failure, thus requiring him to declare martial law countrywide.

I think that if he wanted to impose authoritarian rule, he would simply set aside the Constitution and rely on the brute power of the military and the police. \"Truly, the 1987 Constitution has exorcised the evils of ML.  . . .  ML \u2014 under the present Charter \u2014 merely: \"Facilitates the apprehension of suspects in the crimes of rebellion and invasion (but not in other crimes) and, with the concurrent suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, allows the detention of the suspects for 72 hours (instead of the usual 36 hours). \"Triggers some constitutional provisions that could give the President additional powers or restrict some constitutional rights, provided Congress passes implementing laws specifically defining those powers and rights. Notably, the President has not asked for, and Congress has not passed, such laws. \"Bloated recognition. Consequently, I wonder why the military needed, and still needs, martial law. Other than facilitating the arrest and detention of rebellion suspects a little longer, ML has had, from where I sit, a limited role in suppressing the rebellion in Marawi and Mindanao. \"On the other hand, the imposition of ML has unintentionally given bloated international recognition to the ability of the Mautes and the Islamic-State-connected group of Isnilon Hapilon to engage and, for a while, stymie our far more numerous, superiorly armed, and better trained military for more than three months now. This recognition gave the rebels the opportunity to acquire more logistics, funds and arms from other radical groups, to recruit more cadres and to prolong their terroristic agenda. \"ML\u2019s minuses. Foreigners still believe the traditional concept that ML automatically suspends the rule of law, suppresses civil liberties and imposes authoritarian rule. They are not aware of the strict limitations under our 1987 Constitution. Hence, they avoid places where ML reigns. \"True, foreign tourist arrivals for the entire country grew 12.73 percent in the first half of this year to 3.36 million from 2.98 million in the comparable period last year. But arrivals in Mindanao have suffered cancellations precisely due to the perceived strength of the rebels that necessitated the imposition and extension of ML. \"Likewise, some long-term investments in infrastructures and manufacturing have been put on hold. Closer to the poor, agriculture-based jobs have dissipated while private capital has become shy. \"I am sure the Duterte administration is fully aware of these minuses. Nonetheless, it has asked for and received from Congress an extension of ML till Dec. 31. It must have some reasons beyond my reach as an ordinary citizen. \"Given, however, that the final assault to wipe out the few remaining rebels is well on its way, the military could or can recommend ML\u2019s termination soon. No law prevents the President from accepting such recommendation and ending ML at any time prior to Dec. 31. \"By lifting ML (and the suspension of the privilege) early, the President will signal normalization in Mindanao. He will also be lauding the ability of the military to contain the uprising, moving forward, without any need to detain rebellion suspects for more than the usual 36 hours. \"Moreover, he will also encourage the return of tourists and of long-term investments in Mindanao to create new jobs and to rev up the economy.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm reading that Duterte is starting to get pushback for all the \"drug user/dealer\" executions.
