It also said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was unlikely to agree anyway. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, last week pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they were not concealing activities banned by the 2015 nuclear deal reached between Iran and six major powers. U.S. President Donald Trump has called the nuclear pact -- negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama -- \u201cthe worst deal ever\u201d. In April, he ordered a review of whether a suspension of nuclear sanctions on Iran was in the U.S. interest (para 1-4). \u201cOFF LIMITS\u201d Under U.S. law, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear deal. The next deadline is October, and Trump has said he thinks by then the United States will declare Iran to be non-compliant (para 11). So far, IAEA inspectors have certified that Iran is fully complying with the deal, under which it significantly reduced its enriched uranium stockpile and took steps to ensure no possible use of it for a nuclear weapon (para 11-12).

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the four countries described the July 27 launch as inconsistent with a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution.

roadblock in U.S. House Zengerle (2017) Tue Jun 20, states that: Legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia and Iran that passed the U.S. Senate nearly unanimously last week has run into a procedural problem that could prevent a quick vote in the House of Representatives, lawmakers said on Tuesday. The Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act, which also includes new sanctions against Russia, passed the Senate 98-2 last week, an overwhelming vote that looked like it might complicate President Donald Trump's desire for warmer relations with Moscow. But the measure must still pass the House before it can be sent to Trump to sign into law, or veto, and the House parliamentarian found that the legislation violated a constitutional requirement that any bill that raises revenue for the government must originate in the House, something known as a \"blue slip\" violation. \"The final bill, and final language, violated the origination clause in the Constitution,\" Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters (para. 1-4).

Conflict in Iran Salmi (2017) May 1, states that: Tehran- Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday slammed election slogans of outgoing President Hassan Rouhani on the removal of the \u201cshadow of war\u201d from Iran by signing the nuclear deal. Iranians should not thank Hassan Rouhani\u2019s policy of detente with the West for any reduction in the threat of war, Khamenei said on Sunday, stepping up his criticisms of the president as elections approach. Hours later, Rouhani renewed his position, but softened his tone. At the same time, Iran\u2019s Election Commission announced that it received complaints from four candidates in the presidential elections because of the issues witnessed in the first debate. Ebrahim Raisi, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, and conservative presidential candidate Mustafa Merslim protested against the way the debate was moderated and accusations made against competitors. In comments that appeared to favor hard-line candidates in the May 19 vote, Khamenei played down the benefits of Rouhani\u2019s landmark agreement to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in return for a lifting of international sanctions. \u201cSome say since they took office the shadow of war has been faded away. This is not correct,\u201d Khamenei was quoted as saying by state media. \u201cIt\u2019s been people\u2019s presence in the political scene that has removed the shadow of war from the country.\u201d Khamenei and his hard-line supporters have also criticized the nuclear deal \u2014 which stiffled talk by Washington of possible military action against Iran \u2014 for failing to deliver promised economic benefits. But speaking at the opening of a refinery that Iran says will make it self-sufficient in oil products, Rouhani defended his position. \u201cThe nuclear deal was a national achievement. We should make use of its advantages. But some have started a fight over it,\u201d Rouhani said. He cited the new refinery, in the Gulf port city of Bandar Abbas as a result of the deal and \u201cinteraction with the world\u201d. One of Rouhani\u2019s main challengers, Raisi, an influential cleric with decades of experience in the hard-line judiciary, said Iran had no need of foreign help to improve the economy and could always defend itself (para. 1-11).

In a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, on Tuesday U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iran remained compliant with the 2015 deal, but said there were concerns about its role as a state sponsor of terrorism. Under the deal, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days on Iran's compliance under the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). It is the first such notification under U.S. President Donald Trump. \"The U.S. Department of State certified to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan today that Iran is compliant through April 18 with its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" Tillerson said in a statement. \"President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security Council-led interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States,\" Tillerson added.

Tillerson told reporters the review, which he announced on Tuesday, would not only look at Tehran's compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal but also its behavior in the region which he said undermined U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. His tough words matched those of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said in a visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that Iran's destabilizing influence would have to be overcome to end the conflict in Yemen. President Donald Trump ordered the review to evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to the nuclear deal was \"vital to the national security interests of the United States,\" Tillerson said Though there was no sign the Trump administration intended to walk away from the deal, Tillerson twice cautioned that if left unchecked Tehran could become a threat like North Korea, which is also under pressure over its nuclear ambitions.

The bill has seven Republican and seven Democratic sponsors, and aides said it has a good chance of eventually becoming law. It would set mandatory sanctions for anyone involved with Iran's ballistic missile program. And it would apply sanctions to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), putting into law sanctions imposed via executive order on individuals tied to what the bill's sponsors describe as Iranian support for terrorism. The IRGC, an elite military body, is powerful in Iranian politics and the economy. The legislation would also require the U.S. president to block the property of any person or entity involved in specific activities that violate the U.N. arms embargo on Iran. Iran has suggested about past proposed sanctions bills that they would violate the international nuclear agreement reached during the administration of former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a co-author of the measure, told Reuters the new bill had been written not to interfere with that accord. \"We assiduously worked to make sure that no provisions actually affect the agreement as it is,\" he said in an interview. Aides said the bill is expected to pass the Senate because of the breadth of its support.

The challenge raises the prospect of a confrontation with the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump because diplomats say Iran is only months away from reaching that cap. The 2015 deal restricts Iran's atomic activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against Tehran. One restriction is on its stock of heavy water, a moderator used in a type of reactor that can produce plutonium, like an unfinished one at Arak that had its core removed under the accord (para. 1-3). Trump is a vocal critic of the deal who has said he wants to \"police that contract so tough they (the Iranians) don't have a chance\". His administration has stuck to the previous U.S. position (para. 8).\n\"Any excess heavy water in excess of the firm cap of 130 metric tons cannot remain in Iran,\" the United States said in a statement to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting last week.\nWestern officials say they are concerned that Tehran continues to produce heavy water far more quickly than it is consuming or selling it. It had 124.2 tonnes of heavy water on its territory a month ago.\nThe IAEA, which is policing the deal, told member states at a meeting on Feb. 28 that if Iran kept producing heavy water at the current rate, it would reach the 130-tonne limit by May, several diplomats who attended the meeting said (para. 8-11).

Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC\u2019s air forces, said the Hormuz 2 naval ballistic missile soared for about 155 miles before successfully hitting a floating target, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency. The IRGC is a force tasked with safeguarding Iran\u2019s Islamic system. It operates independently of the country\u2019s regular armed forces. The test took place \u201cin recent days,\u201d according to Tasnim\u2019s report. It wasn\u2019t clear where the missile was fired or what body of water it struck. The Hormuz 2 can strike floating vessels at a range of around 186 miles, the report said. A separate medium-range missile test Jan. 29 prompted President Donald Trump to impose new sanctions on people and companies connected to Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The sanctions, accompanied by his assertion Feb. 2 that Iran was \u201con notice\u201d for firing the missile, amounted to the new administration\u2019s first significant move to contain Iran. Historically tense relations between Washington and Tehran have increased under Mr. Trump, who this week included Iran among six Muslim-majority countries barred from obtaining U.S. visas under a revised executive order.

Hossein Dehqan said in September that Iran would start production of the missile. \nU.N. resolution 2231 -- put in place days after the Iran nuclear deal was signed -- calls on the Islamic Republic not to conduct such tests. However, this is at least Iran's second such test since July. The resolution bars Iran from conducting ballistic missile tests for eight years and went into effect July 20, 2015. \nIran is \"called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology,\" according to the text of the resolution (para. 1-8).
