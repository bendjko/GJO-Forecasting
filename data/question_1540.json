Flights to China continue to be suspended until April 18. BA made the decision to pull all flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until April 17, 2020. The airline has also reduced its schedule to Hong Kong, merging two daily flights into one. The head of British Airways said coronavirus was causing an unprecedented crisis, warning that aircraft would be parked like never before and staff laid off, in a hard-hitting staff message to address \"the worsening situation\". \"It is a crisis of global proportions like no other we have known,\" BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz told staff. \"Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company.\" The message headlined \"the survival of British Airways\", comes as airlines across the world cancel flights and cut costs to counter the plunging demand and U.S. travel restrictions on European passengers. As a result, he said that jobs would be lost \"perhaps for a short period, perhaps longer-term\" and that the company was in discussions with trade unions. Aircraft would be grounded in a way that the airline has never had to do before.\n--------------------\nBritish Airways scraps its dividend and furloughs over 30,000 staff on 80% pay in a desperate bid to survive the worst crisis in its history\n-------------------\nCOMMENTS: However, this question is not just about whether or not BA will want to resume flights, but more whether BA can resume flights. Besides the financial issues reported above, the reduction of personnel may induce BA to make careful decisions about their routes too. However, the main issue I'm afraid will be whether BA will be authorized to resume flights. As of today the UK has about 40K infected people and growing. China still has some more cases, it is not completely under control. \nConsidering that Italy is on quarantine since the beginning of March and maybe they are on the apex now, it will take--in a best-case scenario--another month and a half to feel safe.

BA only flies direct to China twice a day. They could just reuse these planes for other routes, leading them to not be in a rush to resume service.

However, this is also depends on if the virus will rebound again and if the the incubation period is actually 27 days vs 14.

As of yesterday, their summary on the situation regarding cancellation of flights to these two locations is as follows: \"Following the Foreign Office\u2019s continued advice against all but essential travel to mainland China, we have cancelled our flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai until 19 April 2020. This situation will remain under review and we will continue to provide regular updates\" [2]. The latest WHO Situation Report [3] shows that there remain new cases in Beijing province but not Shanghai province - specifically, there are 3 new confirmed cases in Beijing and 0 in Shanghai. However, there are also 26 suspected cases in Beijing and 48 in Shanghai - so more confirmed cases in the coming days seems likely. Thus, it seems likely that more cancellations will occur - it seems probable, for instance, that there will be another 15-20 day extension of the cancellation period.  Beyond that, it is extremely difficult to ascertain how the epidemic in mainland China will play out - while confirmed cases are dropping [4], there may yet be a resurgence of cases once movement restrictions are eased [5]. As such, there is a lot of uncertainty in my probability estimates.
