See here for more info: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/841007 Other judgments: \n- EWP estimate at 3.7%. [1]\n- Crowd forecast here is 3%. Inside view:\n- According to EWP, \"CAR has an ongoing non-state-led mass killing, perpetrated by anti-balaka groups, which began in 2013.\" [1] They write further: \"In the course of the violent conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) since 2013, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka/ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebels and opposing anti-Balaka armed groups have carried out systematic attacks on Christian and Muslim civilian populations, respectively. While many groups have been involved in violence, it is clearest that anti-Balaka militias were responsible for more than 1,000 civilian fatalities.\" [2] So EWP count one side of the ongoing civil war [3] as engaging in mass killing. \n- the CFR has a good background on the country's violence [4]\n- options for another episode are: (1) (ex-)Seleka rebels or (2) another group entirely\n- (2) seems fairly unlikely since most of the violence seems to be aligned. There are some exceptions [3], but they strike me as exceedingly unlikely to escalate. Perhaps 1%, but likely less.\n- (1) is hard to tell. There was another attack in October, killing 15 [5], January, with four people killed [6]. The peacekeepers don't seem to help much. [7] According to Wikipedia, casualties seem to be low, but I'm not sure how much I can trust these numbers. While a peace agreement was signed in February, these seem to have been routinely violated in the past. [8] So I wouldn't put much trust into them. Overall, I don't see any signs that violence would escalate this year in particular. Overall judgment: \n- 3% seems about adequate given outside view and inside view.
