If games are played, then this will play out longer. April recess will happen, and then the question is how long it takes to bring it to a vote. The Process     The President usually will consult with Senators before announcing a nomination.     When the President nominates a candidate, the nomination is sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration.     The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on the nominee. The Committee usually takes a month to collect and receive all necessary records, from the FBI and other sources, about the nominee and for the nominee to be prepared for the hearings.     During the hearings, witnesses, both supporting and opposing the nomination, present their views. Senators question the nominee on his or her qualifications, judgment, and philosophy.     The Judiciary Committee then votes on the nomination and sends its recommendation (that it be confirmed, that it be rejected, or with no recommendation) to the full Senate.     The full Senate debates the nomination.     The Senate rules used to allow unlimited debate (a practice known as filibustering) and to end the debate, it required the votes of 3/5 of the Senate or 60 senators (known as the cloture vote).  In April 2017, the Senate changed this rule and lowered the required votes to 51 to end debate on Supreme Court nominations (this is commonly known as \"the nuclear option\").     When the debate ends, the Senate votes on the nomination. A simple majority of the Senators present and voting is required for the judicial nominee to be confirmed.

However, according to [3] the average time to first hearing was 41 days, and Jackson is scheduled to start March 21 [4]. That's only 24 days. So that makes average time from hearing starting to confirmation about 27 days, and means she would on average be confirmed by about April 20.

Hearings start March 21, and there's 41 days between then and the question close. The time from start of judiciary committee hearings to confirmation by the Senate for the past 7 justices have all been <41 days. The longest was Kagan at 38. From a scheduling perspective 41 days is plenty of time, and Dick Durbin who chairs the Judiciary Committee has said there's \"no reason to wait or delay\" (https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-judge-jacksons-confirmation-hearings-march-21/story?id=83207791). The average time from nomination to start of hearings since Roberts is 41 days, and Jackson's wait was only 21, so he seems to be making good on that promise. Barring Durbin scheduling the Judiciary Committee vote super late for some reason, there shouldn't be an issue with timing.  In terms of votes, there don't seem to be any major causes for concern. There's been no vocal opposition to her confirmation, no scandals thus far, and Democrats have enough votes on paper to get her through. There's no apparent motive at this point for Republicans to put up a huge fight either, the court will stay 6-3 conservative and rejecting her still leaves enough time for Democrats to simply nominate another justice and confirm them before the midterms (https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2022/03/14/whats-ahead-for-ketanji-brown-jackson-heres-what-recent-history-suggests/). Republicans strategy so far appears to be to play nice and act respectful to try to contrast with how contentious the past few nominations have been with Democrats.  For secondary concerns, Joe Manchin may be a problem, but I would imagine that Joe Biden would talk to him about how he intended to vote before nominating her, so I don't anticipate any problems. He voted for her for the circuit court (https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1171/vote_117_1_00231.htm), so he's a near-certain yes, barring something happening in the hearings. Unconfirmed nominees have been pretty rare, with only 3 from 1987 to now. Merrick Garland was one but that was unrelated to his qualifications, one was Harriet Miers who was retracted because of immediate same-party opposition, and one was Robert Bork, who was hugely controversial immediately as well. Only Bork was arguably not confirmed because of hearings.  The main thing to watch will be the hearings. The hearings may be ugly because its a modern SCOTUS confirmation hearing, or it may be less contentious if Republicans' strategy as they've mentioned is to be nicer now that the appointment is less consequential. Regardless, hearings derailing the nomination would historically be an anomaly. Its unlikely to be Kavanaugh-esque if the best scandal we've heard so far is wondering what her LSAT score is. I'm reserving only 7% for the off-chance of some random scandal, or her performing very poorly due to a possible lack of prep time due to the short schedule.
