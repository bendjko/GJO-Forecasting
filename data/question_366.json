The aircraft fired 15 shots at the Interior Ministry, where scores of people were at a social event, and dropped four grenades on the court, where judges were meeting, officials said. However, there were no reports of injuries. \"Sooner rather than later, we are going to capture the helicopter and those behind this armed terrorist attack against the institutions of the country,\" Maduro said. \"They could have caused dozens of deaths,\" he said. The 54-year-old socialist leader has faced three months of protests from opposition leaders who decry him as a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy. There has been growing dissent too from within government and the security forces. At least 75 people have died, and hundreds more been injured and arrested, in the anti-government unrest since April. Demonstrators are demanding general elections, measures to alleviate a brutal economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed opposition activists, and independence for the opposition-controlled National Assembly legislature. Maduro says they are seeking a coup against him with the encouragement of a U.S. government eager to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world. Venezuela's government said in a communique the helicopter was stolen by an investigative police pilot called Oscar Perez, who declared himself in rebellion against Maduro (para 1-8).

The government said Neomar Lander died when a homemade mortar exploded in his hands while hundreds of youths faced off with National Guard troops in the Venezuelan capital. Opposition lawmakers, however, said he was killed by a tear gas canister fired straight at him. The state prosecutor's office announced a probe, without giving details (para. 1-3). Critics denounce Maduro as a repressive dictator, and are demanding general elections, foreign humanitarian aid, freedom for hundreds of jailed activists, and autonomy for the opposition-controlled National Assembly (para. 7). \"We mustn't let fear intimidate us, let's stay in the streets to fight for all Venezuelans' future,\" said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro, weeping at a news conference as he described seeing Lander's death. \"Soon we will able to say these were the last, dark days of the dictatorship.\" Maduro, 54, calls his foes violent right-wing \"fascist\" conspirators seeking a coup similar to the short-lived 2002 toppling of his predecessor Hugo Chavez. \"This is criminal terrorism, and we must reject it,\" Maduro told supporters in a speech carried on state TV, comparing his foes to Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Augusto Pinochet. ECONOMIC CRISIS In the worst turmoil of Maduro's turbulent four-year rule, thousands of people have been injured and arrested in recent weeks. Protesters are also complaining about hunger and shortages during a brutal economic crisis in the OPEC nation. In Caracas on Wednesday, security forces using armored vehicles, water cannons and tear gas blocked opposition supporters from marching to the national election board's headquarters, sparking clashes around the city (para. 7-13).

His comments came after criticism from opponents and some within his own government that his plan to create a new super-body, known as a constituent assembly, to rewrite the national charter was anti-democratic. Chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega had said creating the assembly without a plebiscite, as happened in 1999 when Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez rewrote the constitution, threatened to \"eliminate\" democracy in Venezuela. Maduro said on state television: \"I shall propose it explicitly: the new constitution will go to a consultative referendum so it is the people who say whether they are in agreement or not with the new, strengthened constitution.\" There was no immediate reaction from Venezuela's opposition, which now has majority support after years in the shadow of the ruling Socialist Party whose popularity has plunged during the OPEC nation's brutal economic crisis. Foes are likely to try and turn any referendum into a vote on Maduro himself. They have been calling for the next presidential election, slated for late 2018, to be brought forward. **The government has said elections for the new constituent assembly will be held in late July**, although opposition leaders say the process is skewed to ensure a pro-Maduro majority (para 1-7).

Court magistrates, who are close allies of Mr. Maduro, said they reinstated powers that they had taken from the opposition-controlled assembly and returned the immunity from investigation granted to lawmakers. \u201cRest assured that we will never do anything that threatens the stability of the country,\u201d Chief Justice Maikel Moreno, flanked by Vice President Tareck El Aissami, said in an address to more than 70 foreign diplomats. The court order had drawn international outrage and condemnation from rights groups as well as the nation\u2019s attorney general, a rare voice of dissent from within the ruling Socialist Party\u2019s ranks. Earlier in the day, Mr. Maduro said in a televised speech that the dispute had been resolved after a four-hour meeting with top officials. The president last night urged the court to revise its decision to strip the unicameral assembly of its powers, an act he said demonstrated Venezuela\u2019s vibrant democracy and the separation of powers. Constitutional experts, however, said it did exactly the opposite. \u201cThere is no way to revise a Supreme Court sentence by order of the president,\u201d said Antonio Canova, a constitutional law professor at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas. \u201cOnce they\u2019re published they can\u2019t be modified. It\u2019s now clearer than ever that the court works unconditionally for Maduro.

Obviously its difficult to forecast the likelihood of option \"c\", but as the chaos continues it must be getting more likely. From what I read option \"b\" is unlikely to happen and if it did would be unlikely to produce a change of government policies or competence. \nI had thought that once the result of a recall referendum if successful would only replace Maduro with his Vice President the party might allow it to take place in order to placate the opposition and demonstrate that the constitution was still being followed. I see no signs of this happening. \nThe oil price increase since the November OPEC meeting has given Venezuela a breathing space, but it seems that production of fracked oil is rising again and the is lowering the price. This would suggest that fracking producers are now becoming the swing suppliers, replacing the Arab countries who were performing that role. If so that should dampen price changes. This is not good news for Venezuela that needs much higher oil prices to sort its economy out. \nI now think an overthrow is more likely than a recall or new election.

Although there is a high risk of the latter turfing him out eventually because of hyperinflation, for the purposes of this question a coup won't count - only an early election or recall referendum, and six months may not be long enough for that to happen. \"More of the same in 2017, but the risk of collapse persists - Our baseline scenario for 2017 is that Mr Maduro will remain in office, muddling through on the economic front. Given widespread public anger with the economic crisis, this will not reflect any kind of lingering backing from a loyal support base; instead, he will remain president by virtue of the erosion of basic constitutional rights and backed by the military. If Mr Maduro had abided by the constitution in 2016, the National Assembly would have been able to pass legislation and a recall referendum against the president would already have been held, which in all likelihood would have prompted a fresh presidential election (which the MUD would almost certainly have won). Mr Maduro is likely to remain president in 2017 simply because he has shut down all legal routes of removing him from office. With the military onside, it is difficult to see how a co-ordinated movement of anti-government demonstrations can force the president out. The role of the military will therefore remain crucial. We assume that the government will reward loyalty of the armed forces by granting them access to US dollars at the official-rate and a greater role in policymaking (the military is already in charge of food distribution). However, if hyperinflation were to take hold, the military may well judge that these privileges are not worth the price of continuing to prop up an administration that is doing such damage to the economy. This could well lead the military to withdraw its support for the government. Assuming that this scenario were to materialise in the event of heightened social unrest, the government would be likely to crumble. Although not our baseline forecast, we attach a very high risk to this scenario. Any successor government would need significant support from the IMF, given the depth of economic distortions. Dollarisation of the economy, or the launch of a new currency, would be highly likely.\""], [7124, "2016-12-22T06:44:29Z", [0.15], "Maduro has taken over all avenues of power preventing an early resolution to Venezuela's crisis of government"], [31633, "2016-12-21T21:52:18Z", [0.2], ""], [10720, "2016-12-21T20:54:25Z", [0.05], ""], [11430, "2016-12-21T18:52:47Z", [0.55], ""], [1333, "2016-12-21T18:12:01Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2016-12-21T15:48:38Z", [0.11], ""], [21884, "2016-12-21T09:18:40Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2016-12-20T21:15:20Z", [0.12], ""], [18762, "2016-12-20T19:21:34Z", [0.33], "I don't see how this happens when Maduro controls the election commission, unless a coup occurs or something of that sort.
