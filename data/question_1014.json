Originally, no group claim responsibility. The IS new agency Aamaq stated that IS targeted \"'apostate Shiites' in the Orakzai region* near the Afghan border\". [source; https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ ; and the AP] *The district of Orakzai, where Kalaya is located, was for decades a refuge for Islamist militants fighting across the border in Afghanistan.

Responsibility was claimed by a militant group from the southwestern province of Baluchistan. This group was probably Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which operates on behalf of the Islamic State in places like Baluchistan (this group opposes Chinese investments and political influence in the country). [source: https://www.nbcnews.com] In mid July, an ISIL bombing killed 130 people [various news sources]. Despite its near complete \"defeat\" in Syria/Iraq, ISIL/ISIS/IS continues to successfully target civilian (and some military) populations in the region and, increasingly, in lager population centers in Pakistan. The targets of these attacks (whether directly by ISIL or through affiliated groups) have expanded, in recent months, to include broader governmental targets and Chinese-associated institutions (such as the recent consulate attack). The Pakistani government has managed to limit the number of attacks but has failed to completely eradicate the presence of ISIL in Pakistan, which continues to mount successful (lethal) attacks in Afghan border and Pakistani port cities. Predicting the 'lethality' of one group's attacks (in Pakistan) is complicated in that smaller groups can affiliate with and 'link up' with the larger, better funded IS. So, if we view these attacks as being part of a wider IS campaign (inclusive of sectarian, anti-Government, and anti-China motives), it is likely (not highly likely, but \"somewhat\" likely; perhaps a 1/3 chance or slightly greater) that these will continue, sporadically, and that the total killed may approach 1000 by Sept. 2019."], [691, "2018-11-25T14:03:47Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-11-20T16:11:04Z", [0.02], ""], [61639, "2018-11-19T19:16:20Z", [0.05], ""], [82, "2018-11-19T00:04:43Z", [0.05], ""], [62731, "2018-11-16T04:18:54Z", [0.43], ""], [691, "2018-11-15T16:51:54Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-11-10T12:29:56Z", [0.02], ""], [62428, "2018-11-09T19:23:46Z", [0.05], ""], [62373, "2018-11-09T13:06:09Z", [0.05], ""], [1479, "2018-11-08T03:34:31Z", [0.0], ""], [37488, "2018-11-08T02:44:02Z", [0.06], ""], [46339, "2018-11-06T18:10:01Z", [0.08], ""], [691, "2018-11-06T12:35:17Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2018-11-04T19:16:59Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2018-11-02T16:11:17Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2018-10-30T14:56:55Z", [0.03], ""], [691, "2018-10-28T11:57:37Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-10-20T21:41:38Z", [0.02], ""], [61598, "2018-10-18T06:47:33Z", [0.04], ""], [691, "2018-10-16T12:20:16Z", [0.02], ""], [15196, "2018-10-15T03:33:41Z", [0.0], ""], [3316, "2018-10-14T20:11:27Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-14T18:27:25Z", [0.06], ""], [3152, "2018-10-14T17:36:08Z", [0.01], ""], [61505, "2018-10-14T15:15:25Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2018-10-12T21:11:33Z", [0.02], ""], [1333, "2018-10-11T14:18:13Z", [0.07], ""], [1333, "2018-10-09T14:39:28Z", [0.08], ""], [36132, "2018-10-08T14:50:28Z", [0.0], ""], [30400, "2018-10-07T08:23:31Z", [0.0], ""], [82, "2018-10-06T17:57:43Z", [0.02], ""], [28166, "2018-10-06T11:23:31Z", [0.0], ""], [22833, "2018-10-05T12:44:30Z", [0.0], ""], [40642, "2018-10-03T21:00:46Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2018-10-03T12:22:36Z", [0.04], ""], [1333, "2018-10-01T15:49:26Z", [0.09], ""], [32300, "2018-10-01T14:44:42Z", [0.01], ""], [691, "2018-10-01T11:28:34Z", [0.03], ""], [34405, "2018-09-30T17:53:21Z", [0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-09-30T11:44:46Z", [0.0], ""], [5018, "2018-09-29T19:08:39Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2018-09-29T14:13:15Z", [0.1], ""], [47812, "2018-09-29T13:03:55Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2018-09-29T12:36:37Z", [0.04], ""]], "open_date": "2018-09-28T23:00:40Z", "close_date": "2019-01-01T07:59:40Z"}
