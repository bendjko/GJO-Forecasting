(A case could be made that the explosion a week before the first round helped MLP) I wouldn't put anything past anyone these days.  5+ Feel that the press is very one-sided in coverage (similar to coverage during trump campaign) and limiting coverage of MLP, and angling stories to create positive coverage for Macron. I read the comments in (English) newspapers and there are quite a few anti-macron/holland/globalization ones 5+ -Email hacking as disinformation from Macron/LP camps: \"thousands of emails\" is actually not that much. For instance my own gmail account (20+years old) only has 1.3 GB used. I think I store email very sparingly so my 1.3 Gigs might be l less than the average person's. A news snippet said 9 GB of info were hacked and released. This could equal anywhere from 1 person's work/campaign email system, to say, 10 people (unlikely to be as high as say 100, 50 or even 20 people's accounts.)  Also fact that France was on \"high alert after 2016\" against precisely this sort of attack makes me wonder how the hackers did this. (WSJ).  We must remember, other than Macron's press release, we have no proof yet there has even been a hack. Third, timing of hack, right when news blackout hit means it's all rumour as to what was hacked; who did it; what the hack contains, how damaging it may or may not be. (If it turns out the hack revealed very little damaging info for Macron, then my suspicions would be greatly heightened) - none of it can be actually be scrutinized until after the election, so really, then what was the point? Fourth, the blackout rules were public knowledge. The parties especially very well knew these rules. If MLP did this, then she must have been aware all fingers would automatically be pointed to her so how would it benefit her - more seems to hurt her campaign.  The question is, while MLP voters would be suspicious of the email hack, would Macron voters be? I think likely they would be because they are not very sticky towards him. More likely, that they would question this just as I am questioning and wonder how would it help Le Pen. This is unlike the Hilary voters who were very sticky towards her and failed to notice the negative impact of things like the unsecured server (which wasn't really a crime).

If we say 76% turnout then that would add 10% to the \u201cactual abstainers\u201d above; I\u2019d be inclined to subtract most of these from Macron - his voters would probably be the more apathetic given his lead in the polls: Macron: 50% - 7% = 43%\nLe Pen: 36% - 3% = 33%\nAbstain: 24% Having tried to take a few things into account, that 10% gap does seem rather a lot to catch up, even given inaccuracy of polls, the \u201cshy tory factor\u201d [4], etc. On that basis, I\u2019d put my own confidence at 90% in favour of Macron.

In a sense Le Pen has been setting the agenda for years - and some of the issues she raises - integration of Muslims and the increasingly pernicious threat of Islamic terrorism, and the unaccountability and anti-democratic nature of the EU - are of fundamental importance.  And most mainstream polticians are reluctant to touch these topics with a bargepole - despite the omniscience of armed soldiers on the streets ,a prolonged state of emergency, and hundreds of deaths;  not to mention the economic consequences of the country having sacrificed many areas of financial and economic policy on the altar of the supremely ill-thought-through menace of the Euro.....and the perpetually high unemployment, especially among the young, that has proved very difficult to do anything about. However, her attempts to clean-up the image of the FN have only been partial - and their shortcomings have been made quite blatant in recent weeks. First, her very ambiguous comment - reaching for plausible deniability on one hand - and for the traditional (pre-Chirac) Gaullist line on the on the other - about French culpability for the deporatation of Jews form Paris in WW2 - is a clear black mark against her. And then her interim replacement as Party leader had to step down very quickly after a similar bit of holocaust minimisation. Very much in the fashion of Jean Marie Le Pen - who his daughter has been courage and principled to stand up to..... but, still, today, in May Day FN rallies in Paris, it is still Jean-Marie who has the pride of place..... That will all count against her. As will the sense that she is constantly angry, and that her demeanour is one of someone who is constantly angry. Maybe this will not count for so much - Sarkozy was hardly \"presidential\" in a traditional sense, and nor really (but for different reasons) has been Hollande. What will count for her? Gaining votes from supporters of one of the other main EU-sceptic candidates, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who she has pledged to appoint as PM - but at just under 5% of the 1st round vote, that is no big deal. The support of those who voted for the far-leftist Melenchon, with nearly 20%, would be a bigger prize -   but he has increasingly shifted his stance of being, effectitvely, pro-abstention, to make it clear that he regards Le Pen as a more unacceptable candidate than Fillon. And looking at where Melenchon obtained most support (above all the highly multi-ethnic Seine-Saint-Denis, which is not obvious FN territory), it seems increasingly unlikely that many of his supporters will switch to Le Pen in round 2.  Maybe some Gaullist/\"Republicans\" might, but probably not in very large numbers. In a sense this round is Macron's to lose.  I'm not sure he is in tune with the mood of France, I'm not sure that his eulogies to the EU and to liberal economics (which he would surely, in practice, be unable to enforce) don't repel more voters than they attract. And I don't know how far the legendary \"republican front\" against the FN can hold up, as it did - against a far more overtly repulsive FN figure - in 2002 - or in more recent regional elections.  In theory it should hold up - but really, unless Macron manages to implement substantive economic liberalisation and other social reforms, he is surely on the road to nowhere in the longer term.... If Marine Le Pen is seeking to win the next election in 2022 she would need to further rebrand her party and attract more mainstream Gaullists to her side - and make sure the party is less of a family affair, too, as well as less tainted with the legacy of fascism. (I think the first of these things will be - far -  more difficult to achieve, although the problems of the latter shouldn't be underestimated either). Macron's main areas of support are that he is backed by a substantial part of the (still not entirely insignificant - in terms of organizaton on the ground ) Socialist Party, and by probably a majority of Gaullists. Plus by others who consider themselves anti-fascists who regard Le Pen, still, as such. For now though - even if she has set the general direction and tone, Le Pen has more hurdles to overcome than does Macron.

The legacy with her father is still a problem for many, she is still and remain \"her father's daughter\" Macron is unexperienced and seems to have a thin agenda, however, his plans may be more thought over than the grand plans of MLP.

Aside from that, from where I sit (an ocean and a continent away), Le Pen seems to come across to voters as a regular gal, and Macron can never escape his identity as a toff - or as cultured and sophisticated, depending on which definition you choose. Either way, Macron seems to me to look out-of-touch with voters below a certain economic, educational, and social threshold. I think it's entirely possible that more people will vote *against* Macron because he's a toff than will vote *for* him because he's urbane and well educated. I consider it a mistake to think that Macron will unquestionably get more Melenchon voters than Le Pen.

(I wonder if Melenchon would have been better to beat Le Pen) +\n* Very vague platform (uses hyperbole to cover over bland policy statements in interviews), apparently this was one of the problems with Hilary's campaign. If it's unclear to the voter why he's running, then voters might assume he's just like all the rest - if they're unhappy with the recent decade, or undecided, then they likely can't bring themselves to vote just to fill bucket on his side of the balance. ++\n* His personal life is under attack by opposition. +\n* Former banker ++\n* Former minister under Hollande who is very unpopular ++\n* Endorsements by Hamon and especially Fillion likely to turn undecideds off which only leaves them with Le Pen (If all you have, in this election is your vote, do you want some toff with issues telling you how to spend it?) '+\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Other elements that make this unlike previous elections:\n* terrorism in and around France, Brussels. It is human nature to frame physical and cultural differences negatively -- especially if you are constantly hearing and seeing images in news and movies, etc. So rationally (but, illogically) people would probably be able to talk themselves into a vote for an anti-immigrationist.  I don't think integration has been positive in France. +++\n*Russia rumour-mongering helps Le Pen +\n*France has an uncomfortable relationship with the far-right stemming from World War II. This is being re-told by Le Pen's group to assuage the reluctant voter. She is cleaning up or sweetening this part of history. It very likely will work on certain people at a certain point in their life. (Hitler was voted into power in increments after all) Macron should be a powerful oppositional voice here - rallying his supporters with an emotional appeal at watershed moment in French and European history. But I think, he is too scared, too much of a yes-man to even broach the subject. +++ On the plus side (why she might lose):\n*Le Pen's momentum has been dropping in polls (but this is really of little to no value - not that polling is wrong per se -- it's just an experiment that reinforces its own hypotheses, instead of testing it). If pundits are wrong Euro falls; pound rises\n*Nationalist parties have historically usually underperformed and this was reinforced in first round voting (title weight as past doesn't foretell the present or future)\n*No electoral college which definitely helped trump - not sure if this is better for Macron though \n*Neither LeP or M are from major parties but Macron is centrist which I feel works against him\n*If voters can remember that France has done quite well economically in the past decade (not great though compared to Germany or UK, and effects don't seem to have been spread equitably across demographics) \n*If France votes to stay in EU, then Germany and France's power rise and consolidate as two of the remaining largest economies Other considerations:\n*Le Pen funding - banks refuse to lend to her; seems to get $$ from Russia in return for ? promises after election.

In 2012, pre-first-round surveys gave Fran\u00e7ois Hollande around 54% of the run-off vote against Nicolas Sarkozy; he wound up getting 52%. Five years earlier, they foresaw Mr Sarkozy\u2019s 53% to 47% victory over S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal to within a single percentage point. And of course, run-off polls in 2002 had Jacques Chirac crushing Ms Le Pen\u2019s father Jean-Marie by 78% to 22%; Mr Chirac actually received 82%.\" So previous pre-runoff polls have apparently been very accurate in predicting the ultimate winner. But since The Economist provides no details about undecideds on non-responders, I don't know how much that track record applies to this election. Here's another quote that in my opinion succinctly sums up two approaches to forecasting that we find on GJO: \"At the same time, just because polls can\u2019t tell you everything doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t tell you anything. Given that Eurasia Group has published a quantitative prediction of Ms Le Pen\u2019s chances at 40%, one might assume they had deployed a quantitative methodology to produce it. However, the assessment by Mr Bremmer and Mr Lichfield contains nary a mention of the ample polling figures available.

The headlines talk of a surge by Le Pen, by Macron, by Melenchon or Fillon, or less often a fall in support for Le Pen, Macron, Melenchon or Fillon. Reading the details it then transpires that the \"surge\" or \"fall\" is somewhere between 0.5% and 1% in one poll. The only real change over the last month is that the hard left is moving from supporting  Hamon to Melenchon who has also picked up a few supporters from Le Pen and Macron. My guess is that Hamon will not drop much further (there must be some loyal PS supporters) So to get much higher Melenchon would have to pick up votes from Macron, Fillon or Le  Pen. It seems unlikely that Fillon's supporters would switch to Melenchon (conservative Catholics supporting the hard-left seems unlikely). It seems slightly more credible that Macron supporters who support him because he is an outsider and are not really into policy details could switch to Melenchon as another outsider. It seems more possible that some Le Pen supporters could switch to Melenchon, the far left and far right seem to often meet at the anti-libera/unrealisticl extreme.  Maybe the actual votes will depend on who actually turns out to vote. Will those who dream of a 30 hour week with early retirement, and those who dream of France as it was 70 years ago without immigrants, rush to vote because they think they can make their dreams come true, or do they know that voting for the dream will be like voting for Hollande, who had a dream that he could not deliver.

But the question is pertinent to French national identity, and therefore to the election: is the real France the Vichy regime, or is the real France De Gaulle's Free France? From everything Macron has said,  it appears that his answer would be that the true expression of France is Vichy. Le Pen - despite her father's sympathy for the Vichy regime - is making an appeal to the Gaullist myth. In the French article I link below, she's quoted as advocating \"la promotion du roman national,\" which I translate as \"promotion of the national epic.\" (I realize that \"roman\" usually translates as \"novel,\" but I think the sentiment here clearly implies the English term \"national epic.\") I would imagine that the other candidates will have to weigh in on this matter, since in the past both the Gaullist Chirac and the Socialist Hollande have apologized for French complicity in the Nazi genocide. Le Pen appears to be staking out the traditional postwar Gaullist turf, and it remains to be seen if a) she winds up the only candidate who is able to claim the mantle of the \"national epic,\" and b) if this makes a difference.

Le Pen and Macron on 23% each and Fillon and Melenchon on 19% each. Melenchon is attracting more and more of the votes from the Socialist Hamon who in the last three weeks has lost a third of his support. It appears that Melenchon may be also picking up votes from Le Pen and Macron who have both also slipped back a bit in the last week. If Melenchon continues to pick up votes he could challenge Le Pen and Macron in the battle for the two run off places. French voters must be thinking about tactical voting by now. Melenchon's policies must sound very appealing to socialists (reduce the hours and the years that people will work to spread the work between the people, tax the fat cats income at 100%). How many socialists really believe him is a different matter. They must have noticed that the present socialist government  did not actually trust these policies and that France still has higher unemployment than less socialist countries in Europe. So maybe those who will actually caste a ballot for him will only be the true believers in socialism, just as the only people who will vote for Le Pen will be the true believers in Nationalism. The problem for many French people would come if the two candidates that get into the 2 round are Melenchon and Le Pen, both extremists who seem to offer different solutions that are equally outside the mainstream. If this looks likely the mainstream voters could abandon Fillon and switch to Macron as he looks less scary than Le Pen or Melenchon.

Is this a trend? A harbinger of things to come? How many more 3-point drops can he take before he's no longer a viable candidate? Has his candidacy imploded? What does it all mean? Actually, it means absolutely nothing. At this stage, the only polls that matter are those that predict the vote for the April 23 preliminary round. It is only after the first round ends that the second round polls will begin to take their final shape. In my opinion, the thing to watch for in polls between April 23 and the runoff is the number of undecided voters. If there are enough undecided voters to give Le Pen a win, it means that her \"extremist\" views are not considered all that extremist, and a significant number of voters regard her as an acceptable candidate - and presumably acceptable president. A large number of undecideds after April 23 doesn't mean that she'll win, but it will mean that the prospect of her winning cannot be dismissed out of hand.

Centrist Emmanuel Macron is projected to come out on top in the first round of France's presidential election next month ahead of far-right leader Marine Le Pen before going on to win in a runoff, a Harris Interactive poll showed on Thursday. Macron was seen winning 26 percent of the vote in the April 23 first round followed by Le Pen on 25 percent, according to the poll for France Televisions. Both scores were unchanged from the last time the poll was carried out two weeks ago, even though it was carried out after the two traded barbs in a televised debate on Monday involving all the main candidates. Conservative candidate Francois Fillon saw his score slip to 18 percent of the first round vote from 20 percent as he struggles to limit the damage from a series of financial scandals. Meanwhile, far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon saw his share of the vote rise to 13.5 percent, surpassing for the first time the score for the ruling Socialists candidate Benoit Hamon at 12.5 percent. Macron was seen winning the presidency by beating Le Pen in the May 7 runoff with 65 percent of the vote to 35 percent for the National Front leader, unchanged from two weeks ago. The poll was conducted on March 21-22 among 6,383 voters.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-idUSKBN16U09F?il=0"], [1064, "2017-03-23T01:25:23Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [2965, "2017-03-22T23:59:47Z", [0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.98], "https://depuis1958.fr/"], [31784, "2017-03-22T21:55:14Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.43, 0.0], ""], [32843, "2017-03-22T21:41:59Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [32531, "2017-03-22T21:26:06Z", [0.09, 0.0, 0.01, 0.9], ""], [156, "2017-03-22T21:03:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], "Appears to be headed for a run-off between Macron and LePen, which should resolve in favor of Macron."], [34487, "2017-03-22T19:50:38Z", [0.55, 0.12, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [12879, "2017-03-22T19:12:30Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [17036, "2017-03-22T18:55:24Z", [0.35, 0.35, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-22T16:38:49Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [10924, "2017-03-22T15:58:28Z", [0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6], ""], [691, "2017-03-22T12:33:35Z", [0.04, 0.0, 0.0, 0.96], ""], [19801, "2017-03-22T06:45:59Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.95], "Macron most convincing in French election TV debate: Harris poll\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-poll-idUSKBN16S15N?il=0"], [368, "2017-03-22T03:17:50Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [241, "2017-03-22T01:48:10Z", [0.08, 0.0, 0.07, 0.85], ""], [19260, "2017-03-21T23:58:19Z", [0.14, 0.01, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [14777, "2017-03-21T21:33:55Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.1, 0.85], ""], [24771, "2017-03-21T20:32:45Z", [0.14, 0.0, 0.11, 0.75], ""], [4634, "2017-03-21T20:11:43Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [73, "2017-03-21T20:00:35Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [20328, "2017-03-21T19:00:25Z", [0.62, 0.0, 0.0, 0.38], ""], [29098, "2017-03-21T18:42:46Z", [0.33, 0.12, 0.2, 0.35], ""], [29098, "2017-03-21T18:40:05Z", [0.26, 0.12, 0.18, 0.44], "Comment deleted on Mar 21, 2017 06:53PM UTC"], [38, "2017-03-21T17:43:16Z", [0.07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.93], ""], [23006, "2017-03-21T17:19:23Z", [0.96, 0.0, 0.0, 0.04], "is Macron the option for \"none of the above\""], [23006, "2017-03-21T17:17:56Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [684, "2017-03-21T17:07:22Z", [0.2, 0.05, 0.05, 0.7], ""], [32531, "2017-03-21T16:02:31Z", [0.09, 0.0, 0.14, 0.77], ""], [34472, "2017-03-21T15:40:00Z", [0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.35], ""], [212, "2017-03-21T15:17:00Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.05, 0.65], ""], [34313, "2017-03-21T13:20:15Z", [0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.7], "Yesterdays, tv debate did not do much to advance a particular contender.

Conservative Francois Fillon's struggle to overcome allegations that members of his family were paid public money for work they did not really do has also benefited Macron. The poll showed Fillon, a former prime minister who had sought to project a wholesome image before the scandal broke in January, would be eliminated from the race with only 20 percent of the first round vote, down one point from two weeks earlier. In the May 7 runoff vote, Macron was seen winning the presidency by 65 percent to 35 for Le Pen, with him gaining five percentage points from two weeks ago and her losing five.

The U.S. and French electoral systems are quite different, but I think this is beside the point. Whatever dissimilarities there are, both systems rely on people voting in order to determine a winner. So the questions are, who will vote for which candidate, and for what reasons? I think the main issues in the French election will be immigration and terrorism. In fact, I think these will effectively be the only issues. Reading Macron\u2019s manifesto yesterday \u2013 or more accurately, reading several English-language synopses \u2013 I find that he barely broached these subjects at all. He provided some boilerplate about more police, increased incarceration, and increasing the defense budget. The rest of his manifesto was about spending, jobs, and government reform. It seems to me likely that for most French voters, what is important is being able to go to Bastille Day fireworks without someone plowing a truck through the crowd, or attending a concert without someone spraying the venue with automatic rifle fire, or being able to attend Mass without someone beheading the priest. The presence of foreigners in many of France\u2019s cities is probably pretty alarming, and I would think that French voters do not see any reason why they should allow the influx to continue. Macron has said that we are in an age of migrations, and that these migrations are unstoppable. I imagine that most voters regard the current migrations as the result of policies pursued by their governments, and believe that those policies can be reversed if the politicians in power have the will to reverse them. I also believe that they will vote based on that premise, and not on the premise that the migrations are a force of nature outside of human agency. Macron has praised Chancellor Merkel\u2019s immigration policy, and talked about \u201cEuropean values.\u201d But \u201cEuropean values\u201d is an abstraction, and a contentious one at that. He is asking for the votes of French men and women; abstractions don\u2019t vote. And the people whose votes Macron is asking for probably don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to admire about Merkel\u2019s immigration policy. The voters are probably much more concerned about their own personal safety, their national identity, and their country\u2019s civil peace than they are about \u201cEuropean values\u201d as defined by professional politicians, journalists, and NGOs.  I think the voters will probably regard themselves as the inheritors of, and defenders of, France, which is a real place, with a real history, and a real culture that distinguishes its people from other people. I think the voters\u2019 French identity will supersede any European identity that Macron and the political class wants to appeal to. I doubt if Macron has any appeal for working and middle class French men and women. Moreover, I believe this is true even of the hard Left; trade unionists have no reason to support mass immigration, and they have no reason to exempt Islam from their anti-clericalism. They have no reason to support Macron, who has nothing in common with working people, and seems not to offer anything to them beyond platitudes. If the contest is between Macron and Le Pen, I believe that Leftists will vote for Le Pen as an expression of both their national and class identities. Macron is an investment banker by profession. Champion of the working class is a hard sell for him.  What it comes down to, in my opinion, is that a majority of French voters have no positive reason the vote for Macron. Despite his supposed \u201coutsider\u201d credentials, if you are a union member, or a small business person, or unemployed, or in any way just an ordinary person, he is an insider \u2013 again, an investment banker, and former government official. There is no reason to think, from anything that Macron has said, that he\u2019s on the side of ordinary people, or that their priorities are his. Finally, this is not 2002. Jean-Marie Le Pen did not run for president after two years of increasingly horrific terrorist attacks, and an inundation of refugees. The circumstances are quite different for Marine Le Pen, and the issues that her father ran on probably have much more resonance today than they did fifteen years ago."], [20156, "2017-03-04T06:21:49Z", [0.45, 0.04, 0.45, 0.06], ""], [25875, "2017-03-04T06:06:10Z", [0.15, 0.0, 0.35, 0.5], ""], [73, "2017-03-04T03:54:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.9], ""], [21800, "2017-03-04T03:26:09Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.2, 0.75], ""], [26242, "2017-03-04T01:47:43Z", [0.31, 0.0, 0.17, 0.52], "Mostly proportional to PredictIt price divided by sum of prices for four front-runners "], [27461, "2017-03-03T23:48:27Z", [0.28, 0.0, 0.12, 0.6], "Fillon is gone for all practical purposes, but if Juppe is the Republicans' candidate, apparently he has a chance.

So far, this has not exactly harmed the political novice: he has climbed to second place (behind the far-right Marine Le Pen) in polls for first-round voting, and is now favourite to win the run-off. In Paris today, finally, the former Socialist economy minister will unveil his manifesto. Parts of it will be more radical than expected. He wants, for example, to cap redundancy payments and sanction those on unemployment benefit who refuse repeated offers of work. Such ideas will hand fresh ammunition to his critics, especially on the left. But his prospects still look good. His centre-right rival, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, yesterday vowed to stay in the race despite an imminent formal judicial investigation into abuse of the parliamentary payroll. The more damaged Mr Fillon becomes, the greater Mr Macron\u2019s chances\n[from the Economist Espresso] Ms Le Pen will find it difficult to win in the second round; as yet, no poll has shown her doing so. One recently found her losing to Mr Macron by 42% to 58%; against Mr Fillon she does a bit better. But the margins leave little room for complacency. She is a strong campaigner, with a well organised party. Mr Macron, for all that he is fighting an insurgent campaign, can be painted as a very establishment character\u2014of the sort who came off much worse in the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump than elite opinion expected. Many voters remain undecided, and more may still be biddable. Over two-fifths of those who have made a choice admit that they may yet change it.\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21717824-new-social-faultline-france-has-reshaped-countrys-politics-and-sidelined-its-main On Thursday, March 2, the European Parliament approved the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the far-right leader Marine Le Pen. This waiver of immunity was requested by the prosecutor's office in Nanterre (Hauts-de-Seine), which opened a judicial investigation against Marine Le Pen for \"broadcasting violent images\".

The National Front has a loyal base of supporters and will probably win the first round in the elections. However Marine le Pen and her party lack support of other parties' candidates in the second ballot. French voters are likely to turn their votes to the moderate candidate in that case.  Therefore Emmanuel Macron has the highest chances to win the presidential elections. He benefits from the scandals around Fillon and the weakness of the Socialist Party. Moreover his positions are in between the Republicans and the Socialist Party. Thus he appeals to a broad range of voters who are dissapointed with either of them. Additionally he was successful in branding himself as a someone outside the French establishment (although he certainly is).

Looks like Melenchon is not willing to support Hamon, despite his statements that he is open to discussions. And even if they do get together, some of Melenchon's supporters will probably vote for Le Pen. For reason's sake I will give a small chance to Fillon. His support holds steady at 20%, and if Macron slips (possible given his heterogeneous support base), Fillon may get back in the picture.   Le Pen does have a real chance despite the short shrift she receives in this forum. First, there is probably a hidden vote for her (just like there was one for Trump) masked as undecided or support for Melenchon. I expect her first round result to be around 30%, if not above. Second, it matters who she runs against in the second round. Hamon or Fillon would not receive that much widespread support, just like Hillary Clinton didn't in the end. Macron has a better chance against her - he can draw from both the Socialists and Republicans (Juppe's crowd), but the lack of experienced political organization behind him is worrisome.  Updated probabilities (my subjective assessment, of course):\n - Hamon: 20% to form a united left front, 50% to reach the 2nd round then, 50% to win against Le Pen there.\n - Fillon: 20% to reach the second round, 55% to win against Le Pen there.\n - Macron: 70% to reach the second round, 72% to win against Le Pen\n - Le Pen: 100% to reach the 2nd round, 50% to win against Hamon, 45% against Fillon, and 28% against Macron.

It would appear that Melenchon has no chance of getting into the 2nd round and if his supporters stick with his hopeless cause (as they did in 2012) Hamon will also have no chance of getting into the 2nd round. The choice for Hamon's supporters will then be to  waste their 1st round vote and risk the 2nd round being a choice between the Right and the Far Right or to switch to Macron so that the 2nd round is between someone that at least has sympathies with the Socialists and the FN. So in effect the Socialist voters in the 1st round will be voting for either a Republican president if they waste their votes on Hamon or a Socialist/Centrist if they switch their votes to Macron. Which presumable they would prefer as the least bad outcome. \nAlthough it is possible that traditional left wing voters might switch to the FN (in a similar way to traditional Democrat voters switching to Trump or traditional Labour voters in the UK switching to UKIP) it seem less likely now in France, because the FN has been in existence a long time and polls show that only about 5% of voters would switch from any other parties to FN in a 2nd round run off.

In light of the fact that the strategy underpinning the attacks is to turn French society against it's Muslim citizens, it can be supposed that a signinificant attack is due in advance of the elections, with the aim of promoting support for Le Pen. Therefore, assuming a major attack takes place before the French elections, the chances of a Le Pen victory rise noticeably. The question may lay in the timing and number of attacks. Close to the elections is better than too far ahead, if maximum impact is to be had. Also, multiple rather than single attacks are likely in the event that a single one fails.

The fractured Left makes it much easier for LePen to make it to the second round because the traditional base of the left is split amongst 3 parties. Three weeks ago I would have put Les Republicains as the front runner but Penelopegate has caused me to seriously reevaluate that estimate and Fillon has dropped precipitously in the polls. So the fractured left is an artifact that increases Lepen's chances of making it to the second round\n3. Macron (or Fillon) are more centrist candidates (v Melenchon/Hamon/Lepen) and could be stomached by voters of the opposite party in the interest of defeating LePen\n4. However, Marine is much more moderate than Jean Marie and has run a campaign that has attracted much broader swathes of support than he ever did\n5. Macron and Fillon both represent the \"global elite\" a much derided class of people whose positions on globalization and liberalism have been defeated at the polls in Brexit and the Trumpocalypse despite both of those events being seen as relative long shots at various points\n6. a terrorist attack in Europe between now and the election could drive more people into LePen's camp\n7.

Those who write off Le Pen, be aware - she has a well-defined program (which Macron doesn't) and is able to tap into the primal feelings of fear from foreigners and anger against the elites. Also, there is probably a hidden vote for Le Pen, not expressed in the polls. Sound familiar?  I still keep 10 percent for the Republicans - the difference between Fillon and Macron is not that large, and suppose Fillon apologizes deeply for the mistake, returns the money, and asks for forgiveness. His electorate may find it in its heart to do just that. A replacement Republican wouldn't do very well, on the other hand. Lastly, on the Socialists, Melenchon has said he was willing to work with Hamon under certain conditions. I don't put much stock in this, however, as (i) a good chunk of Melenchon's supporters may actually vote for Le Pen (I think), and (ii) the rest may just stay home rather than vote for Hollande's party.

Fillon's support continues to drop as the Fake Jobs for his wife and children scandal shows no sign of going away. Its difficult to see what the Republicans can do about it. The scandal must reflect badly on the morals of a candidate who is supposed to be the moral candidate. Getting another candidate sounds like the best idea in theory, but then that person would have the problem of being the Republican's second choice, and would probably have to chosen by the party rather than via a primary which would also harm a new candidates credibility. \nThe Socialist candidate's support according to the very latest poll seems to be slipping, but that might just reflect a different polling method by the polling organisation.  Melonchon's support has dropped over the last couple of weeks. \nI would expect as the date of the first round voting approaches support for candidates who have less than  10% support in the polls to (e.g. Melonchon and Bayrou) to continue to fade as voters think more about keeping out those who they are most worried about as President (rather than just who they like)\nSo far Macron seems to have the advantage of seeming to be the candidate that is the least bad choice of the most voters. He is not a \"regular business as usual politician\", he is not of the populist toxic right, he is not extreme left. He can't be blamed for the past mistakes of the Socialists (he was a minister, but more of a technocrat than a policy setter), or the Republicans. I suspect that few French voters have examined his policies in detail, and so he can appeal to those who just see the fresh face. I suspect that few NF supporters really believe Le Pen could deliver on her policies (or would actually want her to). I suspect few Socialist or Melonchon supports really believe that shorter working hours are the answer to France's problems. So if the Republicans can't put up a good clean candidate Macron must stand a good chance of winning as the \"change\" candidate.

Some even worry that the propaganda apparatus will partner again with Russian operatives with the aim of tilting the outcome of elections in favor of Kremlin-friendly candidates.\u201d -- Situation Report, Foreign Policy <fp@foreignpolicy.com>\t Dateline 1-9-2017 http://time.com/4627780/russia-national-front-marine-le-pen-putin/"], [1333, "2017-02-02T21:56:07Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.35, 0.15], ""], [1738, "2017-02-02T21:18:46Z", [0.28, 0.01, 0.53, 0.18], ""], [30594, "2017-02-02T21:16:54Z", [0.19, 0.09, 0.34, 0.38], ""], [1708, "2017-02-02T20:59:57Z", [0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.55], ""], [368, "2017-02-02T20:45:17Z", [0.65, 0.0, 0.05, 0.3], ""], [32294, "2017-02-02T19:46:46Z", [0.13, 0.0, 0.51, 0.36], ""], [32294, "2017-02-02T19:45:01Z", [0.27, 0.0, 0.51, 0.22], "Comment deleted on Feb 02, 2017 07:46PM UTC"], [14493, "2017-02-02T18:28:37Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.35, 0.5], "As its has been reported that the Republicans are considering changing their candidate due to further revelations that Fillon's children as well as his wife might have been paid as employees without actually acting as employees, it is reasonable to assume that the Republican's chances of winning the election have diminished. \nI would guess that the Wikileaks documents on Le Pen will be like water off a ducks back. Those who support Populists (e.g. Trump, UKIP, Le Pen) seem to be very tolerant of scandals that would be career ending for liberal candidates. It is reported that some Wikileaks documents on Macron are linked to the US Clinton hacking. If so and if all the Wikileaks documents just released are all from the same source it (again) raises the question of who hacked them and why are they being released now? Presumably the Russians would prefer Le Pen as the next President of France so why would they hurt her chances?

It could be argued that one example of \"wearing the spectacles of the 20th century\" is embracing the idea that the most dangerous problem facing Europe is the possibility of the development of rival alliance blocs led by France and Germany. It's just possible that the problems facing Europe today are quite different. And of course, the idea of the nation-state has been the organizing principle of the French polity since Louis XIV, if not earlier. In France, the idea of the French nation long predates the 20th century. And sometimes people feel \"a sense of abandonment\" not because they are being manipulated into feeling that, but because they actually have been abandoned.

A left leaning candidate (Hamon) seems to have won this round and the right leaning candidate seems to have got about 30% of the votes, meaning that around 70% of the primary voters chose the more extremist left wingers. Its reasonable to assume that Hamon will pick up these extreme left votes in the second round. Which will mean Hamon is the official Socialist Candidate. The turnout for the primary was low which reflects that the French left has lost its enthusiasm and presumably does not believe its likely that a Socialist will win the Presidency election. \nHowever in the polls left wing candidates (socialists in outlook) are supported by about as many voters (about 25%) as the far right FN (26%), the right Republicans (27%) and the centre (21%). The difference is that support on the left is divided between the Socialist Party itself and several individuals and small parties. According to the current polls the FG party of Melenchon (15%) is more popular than the official Socialist Party (about 10%) neither are thought to have any realistic chance of winning, or of even getting into the second round. In the 2012 election Melenchon's support drifted down from 17% to 11% by election day (presumably because his supporters gave him no chance of winning and wanted to vote for the least bad candidate who had a chance of winning.) But in 2012 they had the choice of switching to an official Socialist who had a good chance of winning (and who did win), but in 2017 there is no Socialist who appears to have any chance of winning. So what will left wing voters do? \nOption A would be for all left wing supporters to support one candidate. It seems too late for that option.\nOption B would be for left wing supporters to stick to voting for candidates who have no hope of winning, which is likely to guarantee that the next President is either from the Right or the Far Right. Presumably most left wingers would not want that, although some \"left behind\" voters wanting a revolution might be tempted to switch to Le Pen. In the past second round voting after the left wing candidates had been eliminated has not shown evidence of left wing voters switching to FN.\nOption C  would be for the tactical voting to start in the first round (as appeared to happen in 2012, when Melenchon's support faded). In this case its would seem possible that supporters for left wing candidates start looking for the least bad (as they see it) of the three main candidates.  There are more than 25% of voters who favour the left. It seems entirely possible that a quarter or more of them could switch to Macron as being less right  wing than Fillon or Le Pen. Although a few revolutionary minded left wing voters could switch to Le Pen I doubt that many left wing supporters would switch to Fillon. So I see the first round going to any two of Le Pen, Fillon or Macron, with the second round going to Fillon or Macron.  If the first round goes to Le Pen and Fillon then the second round is likely to go to Fillon. If the first round goes to Le Pen and Macron then the second round would likely go to Macron.

Something to watch. For polls, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_French_presidential_election,_2017 Another interesting question: can Macron run on the Socialist ticket after all? Probably not, if he doesn't run in the primaries. But can the Party persuade its own unpopular candidate (Hamon or Valls) to withdraw, so that they can support Macron?

The danger to him is that if he slips much further in the Polls he will create space for Macon.\n With no official Socialist candidate being selected until the end of January the socialist supporters have split their vote between the 4 leading candidates. If the support for these 4 socialists is added together the socialist party would be leading the polls.  The polls appear to show that Socialism is the most popular ideology but the polls ratings of the current socialist government show that liking an ideology and being able to implement it are two different things. The critical issue will be who the Socialists pick as their candidate and how much support will be transferred from the losing Socialist candidates to him/her. Picking someone who is popular with the parties left wing base (e.g. Montebourg, Hamon) would probably not attract many non-Socialists in the Presidental election. If Valls is chosen left wing Socialist might not bother to support him in the Presidential election. Some traditional left wing voters might switch to the NF (as has happened in local elections) but there seems little sign of it in the polls so far. So for this reason I don't forecast a win for the Socialists in this question. \nMacon is now looking to have an outside chance. His problem will be getting into the 2nd round. If the Socialists select a left wing candidate and/or if Fillon appears to be trying to grab votes from Le Pen by being too right-wing, then Macon stands a chance, but he would need to get more votes than either Le Pen or Fillon in the first round. I think the election is still Fillon's to lose, but he could screw up.\nIn this election it seems that the real questions that voters are going to be considering is \"who do you not want as President and how do I stop him/her\". If Le Pen gets into the 2nd round I think that (as has happened before with the NF) the answer will be \"not Le Pen\".

We now know that Hollande is not going to be the Socialist candidate, which raises their chances a little. The polls have consistently shown the Republicans to be the most popular party  ahead of the Front National by 4 to 6 percent in the first round and the Republicans opening up this lead to up to 30% in the latest 2 nd round polls. The FN seems to attract no additional votes between the first and second rounds and no poll shows over 45% for the FN and most polls have the FN at around 33% to 40%. The campaigns have not yet started so It could change. There is no sign in the polls of the surprising Brexit vote or the election of Trump affecting the mood in France. This is surprising as the English language media have made a lot of the idea that there is a swing to the populist right throughout Europe. One might have expected that disillusioned Socialists would switch to the FN, in the same way that Trump has picked up votes from left behind Democrats, and that the media claims are UK Labour voters switching to UKIP. The French polls show no such move. In fact Le Pen's best polling figures seem to have been in 2014 and 2015, and are lower now. Maybe the UK Brexit supporters are just indulging in wishful thinking believing that most countries in the EU are going to vote for right wing populist parties. Austria's re-run Presidential election showed a clear swing away from the Populist candidate between the May vote and December vote,  opening up a 7% lead for the non-Populist winner. Maybe the European Populist tide has passed its high water mark; voters have made their protest and seen no obvious improvements. I doubt that many EU voters see the Brexit vote in the UK has brought any benefits. The latest polls show that only 39% of employees in the UK expect the UK Government to be able to negotiate a good Brexit deal - not a great endorsement of the idea of leaving the EU. As the FN wants to hold a referendum of France leaving the EU the lack of progress in the UK on Brexit would not be an encouragement (and Frexit would be far more difficult that Brexit, as France would presumably need to figure out how to leave the Euro as well).

He knows what to say and when to say it. He managed to put in, that there is this \"believe that Fillon is already the next president, but nothing is set on stone already.....\" It was very well said. He did not read his speech, it looked like he was improvising, hence making him very credible. Fillon on the contrary read his speech; he is not that great of an orator.

Fillon is actually politically vulnerable in both dimensions. Economically, he is too pro-free-market for the left (both hard and soft). Socially, he is too conservative for both the left and parts of the center. But he will solidify the mainstream right and may peel off some Le Pen supporters by giving an acceptable face/voice to their concerns. His main advantage may be that he is not Le Pen (and thus socially acceptable) and not socialist (and thus not associated with Hollande's presidency). But he would need to temper his pro-market enthusiasm in order to win.  Le Pen may attract the hard left (who share her economic platform), but may also lose some voters to Fillon as noted above. The critical question is whether there still be a stigma attached to not voting against her in the second round (as against her father in 2002) or not. Also, it depends on whether economic or social issues will dominate voters' decisions (if the former, her chances are stronger). Too early to answer these questions, but these are things to watch as the race develops. How can the Socialists get a chance in this race? After Hollande declined to run, Vals would probably be the party's standard bearer, but even adding his and Hollande's share of the vote in recent polls, he would still be around 18-20 percent, well behind Fillon and Le Pen. But suppose (I) Macron drops out, or (2) Macron runs in the Socialist primaries (rather than as an independent), and wins. Then it would be a three-way race and the Socialist candidate may make it to the second round. The Socialist candidate would be weaker than Le Pen but stronger than Fillon on economic issues, and the other way around on social issues. So he may have a chance to win by playing up social issues against Le Pen and economic issues against Fillon. These are long shots, but they warrant a non-zero probability. Finally, I still keep zero for \"None of the above\".

It seems to me obvious that anti-immigrant sentiment has been simmering in Europe for a long time, and with the deluge of migrants last year the simmering is now about to boil over. If the authors of the article are any indication of \"respectable\" thinking in Europe, they can't bring themselves to acknowledge this, and their hesitation to see reality will probably cause an electoral shock in France, just as we saw in Britain and the United States. Some quotes: To historians, the unlikely abandonment of this former European bedrock is partly a function of its own achievements.\u201cIt was a failure by success,\u201d said Timothy Snyder, a historian of 20th-century Europe at Yale University. \u201cOnce the left becomes not revolutionary but transformative, and once that transformation succeeds, people start taking it for granted. \u201cEuropeans take for granted that they will have public education, free health care and social services,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the left doesn\u2019t get votes on this anymore.\u201d End first quote. Europeans voted to have \"public education, free health care and social services\" for themselves, not for anybody who happens to make it to their shores. There is no reason for ordinary citizens to accept EU policies and law that require countries to take in asylum seekers and economic migrants, regardless of the social and economic cost. Another quote: \"Trump\u2019s victory in the United States rested at least in part on a similar phenomenon \u2014 a billionaire tycoon using appeals to xenophobia and racism to scoop up support from voters who no longer believe the party of the working man has their interests at heart.\" End second quote. Unmentioned is that in the case of the Democrats, at least, the voters may be correct about the party not having their interests at heart. In any case, the authors of the article make no case that the Democrats *do* have working class voters' interests at heart, they merely posit that Trump does not. Of course, Trump may not, but that doesn't mean that the Democrats do. So the question for Europe, and for France specifically, is whether the left parties, (center left or far left) actually represent the interests of working people. Again, it isn't enough to say that the right is scamming the voters (even stipulating that that's true); the real question is whether the voters are correct about the left parties abandoning their interests. If the left parties have abandoned native-born working people, those people have no rational reason to vote for the left parties. The only reasons that left parties can offer are sentimental ones, or attempts at moral blackmail where voters who care about their traditional societies and historic populations are racists. Final quote: One implication of the growing void on Europe\u2019s left could be profound political instability, both within specific countries and geopolitically. Another could be the emergence of a right-wing stranglehold, based on widespread nostalgia for a world that, in Snyder\u2019s view, never actually existed. \u201cAll these continental parties are nostalgic for the interwar nation-state, which was a total disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never any moment when they were happy, independent nation-states. There was never such a time, and their nostalgia is a kind of disguise. \u201cIf you plunge into that abyss,\u201d he added, \u201cvery bad things lie ahead.\u201d End last quote. This gentleman talks as if he is the only person in the world who is conversant with the history of the 20th century. Actually, you can probably make a good case that the problem with tyrannical nationalism in the mid-twentieth century derived from the tyranny, not the nationalism. But never mind; suppose the nationalism was the problem, or at least one component of a larger problem. Why should this be so in the future? The one \"argument\" that opponents of national parties always make is that the success of such parties means a return to the 1930s. They never say why; they just assume, again, that no one knows a thing about twentieth century history, and if they do, they're just dying to recreate it.  Opponents of national parties are oblivious to the actual grievances of the native populations of Europe, and are completely unwilling to discover what those grievances are, let alone address them. I suppose it is possible that the Republican candidate might win the runoff against Le Pen, but I am more inclined to think that we will get the same kind of surprise we got from Trump and Brexit."], [14777, "2016-11-25T22:28:31Z", [0.28, 0.12, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [30042, "2016-11-25T22:01:20Z", [0.51, 0.0, 0.49, 0.0], ""], [14761, "2016-11-25T21:10:55Z", [0.33, 0.03, 0.64, 0.0], ""], [231, "2016-11-25T18:20:35Z", [0.2, 0.02, 0.78, 0.0], ""], [556, "2016-11-25T17:10:50Z", [0.25, 0.02, 0.58, 0.15], ""], [691, "2016-11-25T15:44:56Z", [0.34, 0.0, 0.66, 0.0], ""], [30576, "2016-11-25T11:29:21Z", [0.15, 0.05, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [30575, "2016-11-25T10:44:34Z", [0.43, 0.12, 0.2, 0.25], ""], [28380, "2016-11-25T10:32:32Z", [0.15, 0.15, 0.3, 0.4], "I am changing my bets.

Most journalists have as little sympathy for her as she has for them, and she had been staying out of the public eye over the past 10 months, working hard to build an electoral strategy. During the period between France\u2019s regional elections last December, when her party scored 27 percent of the popular vote but failed to win control of any region, and the presidential election next spring, she has set herself a single goal: to build enough respectability to shatter the so-called republican front through which mainstream parties unite in the second round of a French election to prevent the National Front from winning. Ms. Le Pen, 48, has worked patiently to transform her party from a marginal extremist movement into an organization able to seize and exercise power. Now she needs to ramp up the frustration among French citizens, which has already propelled her to the top of opinion polls ahead of the first round of presidential voting on April 23, into a force powerful enough to break the barrier of conventional politics and push her through to victory in the second round, scheduled for May 7. She is emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s upset of Hillary Clinton, which she thinks has significantly enhanced her chances of achieving just that. What the president-elect has done, she said on French public television, has been to \u201cprove that what was presented as impossible can be made possible.\u201d Now she confidently says she believes that it can also happen here \u2014 that France in 2017 will provide the third stage of a global political uprising begun by Brexit and reinforced by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. She is not the only one to believe it. Former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a respected center-right senator, thinks the news delivered to France by the American election is this: \u201cMarine Le Pen can win.\u201d Just as a Trump candidacy, let alone a victory, was unthinkable a year ago, most French experts had dismissed the possibility of the far-right leader\u2019s winning the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in 2017.

All polls shows that the National Front will be running against a Republican nominee and that the Republican nominee will win. The socialist have barely 0% chance to win the election. If Francois Hollande runs, he won't even qualify for the second round according to many polls. However, Francois hollande is not even sure to win the socialist primary first as Arnaud Montebourg could win (50/50 according to polls). In the event Montebourg was to win the socialist primary, and that the republican nominee would be Nicolas Sarkozy, the center left candidate Emmanuel Macron (former socialist which will run under his own party \"En Marche\") could eventually create a surprise and make it to the second round against the national front (If the center right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou do not run or make a deal with him). In that case, the chances to win for Emmanuel Macron would be of 80% against the national front. An even biggest surprise would be the election of Marine Le Pen (National front) if she was to run against a non republican. Given the above, the only important prediction to be made here is about the republican nominee that has 95% chances to win afterwards. The latest polls suggest that Alain Juppe will win (56/44 %). However, the former president Nicolas Sarkozy has generated a dynamic around him and his catching up against his competitor and former minister Alain Juppe. My prediction is that given the latest events in France (Paris and Nice Attacks, Syrian refugees, high unemployment rate), Nicolas Sarkozy which runs a campaign further to the right than Alain Juppe, should win the republican nomination (51/49) and win the presidential election against Marin Le Pen (65/35).

The National Front's candidate is almost certain to be Marine Le Pen.  The Republicain candidate is highly likely to be one of Francois Fillon, Nicolas Sarkozy or Alain Juppe. The frontrunner is Alain Juppe and Nicolas Sarkozy's ongoing investigation for misuse of funds on top of his unpopularity is likely to do him harm. Alain Juppe therefore looks the strong favourite. For the PS, Francois Hollande is the sitting President but suffers from very low approval ratings on top of ongoing political troubles over workers' rights and security. His former Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron is running as an independent, trying to appeal to the right and the left. Hollande's main challengers are Manuel Valls, Arnaud Montebourg and Martine Aubry. The most likely contests are therefore Le Pen-Macron-Sarkozy-Hollande, Le Pen-Macron-Sarkozy-other PS, Le Pen-Macron-Juppe-Hollande, Le Pen-Macron-Juppe-other PS with relative likelihoods of c.15%, c.15%, c.30%, c.30%. Polling suggests the run offs would then be Le Pen-Sarkozy, Le Pen-Macron/other PS, Le Pen-Juppe and Le Pen-Juppe. In the only past case when the FN reached the run off (2002), other voters combined to give Chirac a 82-18% win. This also took place in the regional elections in 2015, when the FN were defeated in all regions in the second round. Le Pen has therefore a 95% chance of making the final round, but just a 20% chance of beating either a Republicain or PS candidate.  The PS only have a 15% chance of winning because they are unlikely to make the run off even without Hollande. Juppe or Sarkozy are likely to win in any contest they take part in, of which there is an 85% chance. Macron would be favourite in a run-off between himself and Le Pen, which is itself very unlikely.

He stated this point again in February 2015, saying that \"if after five years, a President cannot meet the objective that he had when he got elected, he cannot be once more a candidate for the highest office in the country\".

Which of those candidates will place 1st and 2nd in the first round? Who will win the second round? Of the important parties, only the FN has decided on its candidate (Le Pen). Especially in the Republicans there is a very broad field of contenders and the Socialists could well decide that running Hollande is not in their best interest. Hollande's candidacy is by no means a sure thing (http://www.politico.eu/article/what-frances-unemployment-news-means-for-francois-hollandes-job-french-elections-2017/). An obvious independent contender would be former economy minister Macron (who has renounced his party affiliation with the socialists). None of the Socialists' potential candidates are currently polling well enough to be among the winners of the 1st round. But most candidates are underpolled, so give the party a token 15% chance of winning, subject to change once we know more about the final candidates. The Republicans and FN certainly have candidates strong enough to go into the runoff. I also think that Macron has at least a chance of placing 1st or 2nd in the first round. For the second round, I basically assume that anyone running against Le Pen wins. She is stronger than in past election cycles, but except for Hollande (who won't be able to reach the 2nd round), polling suggests (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_French_presidential_election,_2017#Opinion_polls_for_expected_second_round_of_voting) that she will loose against any other possible candidate. That leaves the FN with a token 1% chance of winning the election. The big unknown is how Macron would poll against a challenger from the Republicans. This is hard to predict, but I assign him a 15% chance, similarly to the chances of the Socialists. That leaves a 69% chance for the Republicans, in line with the GJ consensus.

To lose the Republicans would need to choose a very poor candidate or really screw up the campaign.

The NF seems to have strong support in 27% to 39% range, for the first round but in a second round the only candidate that would risk losing to Le Pen would be Hollande. Hollande seems so unpopular that unless the Republicans pick a really poor candidate he would not get into the second round. It appears that the NF are extremely likely to get the second round. So the logical thing for each of the other parties to do would be to choose the candidate that can most certainly beat her. The socialists will find it difficult to find such a candidate, the Republicans have several who appear to be likely to beat Le Pen; Juppe seems to be more popular (or less unpopular) than Sarkozy.  There is a chance that Macron could win, but the opinion polls that suggested he would do well assumed that he would be a candidate for the Socialists, he has now said he hopes to stand for a centerist party. Political parties in France seem to be much more  like the personal team of a politician and rise and fall with their leaders, than the more institutional permanent political parties in most other countries. (The politicians are bigger than the parties in France.) So its not clear if breaking with the unpopular PS of Hollande would befit or harm Macron. Maybe he is too new to have as many voters hate him as hate the other candidates.
