The average doses administered/day will probably be in the ballpark of ~0.5M/day, although there could be a bump of 2nd doses of adolescents. The number of people added to the total for this forecast is currently 47% of doses administered, so I'll guess that ~1.2M will be added for the rest of this week, and ~0.24M/day will be added to this category next week, or ~3M (ballpark) by the end of next week. That would bring us to ~173.3M, with 21 days left in the forecast (inc. 3 for back reporting). At that point, fewer than 0.1M people/day would need to be added to the total to stay under 175M, or roughly fewer than .2M/day doses would need to be given on average for the rest of the month. Not since Dec. 28 have fewer than 0.2M Covid vaccine doses/day been given. So, it may be hard for us to conceive of a time when vaccination clinics aren't giving hundreds of thousands of doses each day; nonetheless, that day is coming, and it's probably coming very soon. We are currently at <1M doses/day administered on average; next week, we'll probably be at around 0.5M/day, and the week after, we may be at half that. It may be that after next week (Sunday, June 13), we only add ~1.6M people to this category over the rest of the month. So, I'm most likely going to sabotage my Brier score by assigning substantially higher weight to the possibility of staying <175 than the crowd does. I think this forecast could end up quite close to the dividing line between bins 1 and 2. We should have a much better idea over the next week or 2.
