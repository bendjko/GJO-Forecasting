Schools will not reopen until September. There is no specific mention in the article of mass-gatherings like music festivals however schools are mass-gatherings. Side note: The Italian government has forecasted [2] that due to caronavirus their debt to GDP ratio will jump from 135% to 156% and the EU has forecasted [2] that it will jump to 159%. To put that in perspective Greece had to be bailed out when it got to about 165%. However Italy is too big to be bailed out. It has 2.4 trillion euros of debt compared to Greece which from memory had about 300 billion. Interesting times ahead.

As of 25 March (when I am writing this), CDC testing is actually declining for the month, although currently there is incomplete data for any accurate statements. The question is whether the impact of social distancing will itself be enough to slow down the rate of infection. The determining factor for answering the question concerning rescheduling Coachella is whether or not populations maintain social distancing or begin to disregard this (rather ad hoc) policy. If the rate of infection is slowed within the next few weeks, then it is conceivable that people will decide to go on with their lives. If the risks to public health are brought under control in the same time period, and economic life returns, then the social stigma of gathering in groups will subside - thus eliminating another reason for the Coachella festival to be canceled or postponed.  There is a dissenting voice (Michael Levitt, see below) who claims that the outbreak will subside sooner rather than later. It's hard to lend this claim too much credibility, even though his predictions for China were astonishingly accurate. Nevertheless, China and the US have very different dynamics. It is much more difficult to coerce US public behavior. This is especially the case when there appears to be little political appetite for issuing nationwide \"shelter in place\" orders (as of 25 March). It does not seem to me that Levitt's model for China is applicable to the US.  The problem with the optimistic forecasts is the behavior of Americans themselves. All decisions made at the individual level have nonlinear consequences: asymptomatic people could still be spreading the virus for weeks, infecting thousands of Americans. If communities lose vigilance in maintaining social distancing, then another flare up is easily conceivable - in which case a rescheduling of Coachella would almost be a given.  Also, the pressure to revive the economy is already affecting decision-making at the highest levels. The organizers and owners of Coachella have strong incentives to refrain from cancelling this event or postponing it again.

The weather is usually warm. Ca. 100 000 in attendance per day. Usually it lasts 2 days (Wikipedia). Close contact event.\nhttps://www.gq.com.au/entertainment/music/everything-you-need-to-know-about-coachella-2019/image-gallery/4b0df760309aa435fe8281acc1b88607?pos=5\n\u2022\tHow many will be immunized against corona by the 9th of October(The social distancing we now see is there to ease the strain on hospitals. That could mean that when the number of infected peaks and begins to decline we will start to see a decrease in government restrictions)? \u2022\tWhat might be the potential spreadfactor of corona by the 9th of October(baseline from previous flu)?\n2,4 R0 (seasonal influenza has 0.9-2.1). if unleashed the outbreak is expected to last around three months. \n\u2022\tWhat ways are there to make Covid-19 less of a threat to society?\nIn near future: finding some treatment for intensive care patients, easy testing, \nFurther away: vaccine, natural herd immunity, knowledge of transmitting demographic, \n\u2022\tWhat demographic will be immunized the most and what representation will it hold at the event?\nUnknown, but say corona only transmits from symptomatic people, I do not count on young 20-year olds to stay at home if they have tickets for Coachella.\n\u2022\tWho is making the decision of whether or not to postpone/cancel and how factual of a decision will it be?\nProbably Goldenvoice owned by AEG\n\u2022\tHow long would government measures need to last to be effective?\nSocial distancing: UK scientist- close to one year on a strict/not strict cycle.\n\u2022\tWhat has led other similar events to cancel that wasn\u2019t caused by Covid-19?\nSingle artist events more vulnerable. Coachella has at least three potential threats. Either they lose a lot of money by postponing and therefore do not have enough money to host the event- I can\u2019t find anything on google that suggests a lack of funding. They could also suffer a loss of sponsors. The second threat would be if they are unable to book enough artists or the artists will not hold the standard Goldenvoice has. Thirdly a natural disaster could occur.\n\u2022\tHas the state of California acted in any particular way regarding Covid-19 or Coachella?\nPlaced a ban on gathering with more than 250 people and especially with event that has close contact with other people and brings people together from vast areas. All of which applies to Coachella. Restrictions are in affect until the end of march and will be reevaluated then.\n\u201cBy decreasing the prevalence of disease across California we will: \u2022Reduce the number of Californians who contract COVID-19 before an effective treatment or vaccine is available. \u201c\n\u2022\tIs it possible for the Coachella concert to obtain a 6 feet distance between each person and is it possible for the km^2 to become larger and extend hours?\nI believe that Coachella could expand after looking at arial photos, although I think it will be virtually impossible maintain a consistent distance of 6 feet between every person.\n\u2022\tHow will Trump and the state of California move forward with different measures?\nTrump has stated that he doesn\u2019t intend to endorse restrictions for long, weeks not months. This seems to include social distancing and would likely mean that Coachella wouldn\u2019t be restricted if only Trump was in charge. Note that Trump can change his mind fast but it\u2019s believable that he wants the economy to remain strong causing him to ease restrictions. If different states didn\u2019t have different restrictions this would suggest a outbreak that would not last until October. California is run by a democrat and was the first state to enact mandatory restrictions. The way California has handled the coronavirus will most likely postpone the surge of corona patients, although we might not notice a drastic effect in the number of patients. British scientist believe their restrictions will be in place until September.

In addition, more effective treatments and better testing could also make the disease less deadly. Also, I think the media has overestimated the mortality rate of COVID-19.

I think poor testing has caused countries to fail to properly count the less serious cases, hence they overestimated the mortality rate.
