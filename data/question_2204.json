Surviving the midterms against historical trends would require the voting rights bills currently being considered to be signed into law. There is a concerted effort to rally the votes around the MLK Jr. holiday for messaging purposes. Therefore, I do not think that the Biden administration is making BBB a priority right now. Additional evidence to support this is that in December, Majority Leader Schumer promised a vote on the BBB Act to pressure Senator Manchin and threaten him with an official vote on his record on which he could be attacked. I have not read anywhere about the planned vote. It is my suspicion that Leader Manchin and President Biden are trying to ease tensions with Senator Manchin so that he would be more likely to go against his previous stance and vote for a filibuster carveout to pass the voting rights bills. Additionally, because of recent reporting and media appearances by folks like Stacey Abrams, the messaging seems to be centered around voting rights and tying that effort to January 6th. Passing both large pieces of legislation in a dual track would be a nearly insurmountable task for the Biden administration, especially considering his low approval rating.
