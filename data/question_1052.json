This was seen as nearly impossible since the head of the labor party, Corbyn did not support a second referendum, but his recent support for it could change the game, if he had the backing of the entire labor party. It still remains unlikely, but Corbyn\u2019s change in position shifts the probability a bit. That said, there isn\u2019t much time until the UK is set to leave the EU, May\u2019s second plan was just voted down, and March 29 is fast approaching, lessening the likelihood of any change in the law which would allow a second referendum unless the deadline is extended and then a referendum is called. Without the time constraint, the likelihood of a referendum would be greater. As for a snap election, Corbyn has called for one, but many say that it is unlikely May would  call for one, since she could lose votes to a centrist labor party, so a snap election is less probable than a referendum.

This makes no statement about a UK referendum to instead stay, nor should assumption be made as such. Thus I leave open one possible, albeit unlikely, sequence of events which prevents a certain \"No\". Note 1: The UK parliament will hold a vote on Tuesday on a potential deal, this could easily go either way. For lack of better information I'll default here to betting markets and give this odds of 40%\nNote 2: In the event that a vote on the deal falls through there will be a vote for on a no-deal/deal Brexit, and subsequently on whether to delay the article 50 deadline. In normal circumstances I would hold these as essentially mutually inclusive (95%) to a no-vote on the existing deal, however certainty in UK politics seems to be a past-time given recent political divisiveness. So my best assertion is 80% on a vote to delay.\nNote 3: In either a no-deal or delayed article 50 request circumstance the situation of a hard-border to Northern Ireland is still a looming cloud. Hedging a bet here to allow NI to remain (whether permanent or temporarily) would be wise, albeit unlikely.

As both Labour and Conservatives have MPs openly defying their leaders both parties are in a bind. A general election would not change who the party leaders were, so how would MPs campaign? \"vote for me and risk getting my party leader that I think is/would be a bad PM\"? \"vote for my party, when my party's policy on Brexit is either nebulous or to kick the can down the road and hope something turns up\"? Would the ERG (hard Brexiteers) vote for No Confidence in May with the Labour Party, but the rebel MPs who have resigned from their parties for Mrs May to stay PM? So unless MPs are even more stupid than the public think they are they will not vote for a general election. I think the only way out of the mess is to extend A50 for at least 9 months, for parliament to agree the EU WA  (note passing the EU WA does not force the UK to leave EU until its ready) so that talks on the Future Agreement can start with the aim of having a detailed Future Agreement mapped out before the UK's EU Leaving Date is reached. Assuming a Future Agreement deal can be reached that would have to contain a solution to the Irish Border (so no backstop would be needed), At the point when a concrete deliverable FA that the EU agrees to exists either the UK Parliament would need to either approve it, or a general election would need to be help to give assumed approval or rejection, or a referendum would be needed so the public could ratify or reject the FA. If the parliament (or the public) reject the FA they can then Revoke A50. If A50 is not Revoked the UK laves the EU and starts the transition period (which would presumably be needed).

Even if they came to decide for a new referendum, it will take time to decide on the question it asks, there must be an allowed period of several weeks for campaigning, etc. Since a second referendum may materially alter Brexit, I feel the UK could get an extension on the 29/03 deadline for that. Plus, they have the option of unilaterally withdrawing A50, so that gives them some leverage in asking for an extension. So I all but discard second ref before 29/03: 1%. For the snap election, that also takes time to organize. In 2017, when there was already a big hurry to do it, it took 51 days between it being announced and it happening. Apparently Labour is calling for snap elections if Parliament reject's May's current deal, which seems almost certain to happen. But there needs to be a 2/3 majority for snap elections to be called, or 434 votes. Even if every MP from every party but ruling coalition (Con+DUP) votes for it, you still need 111 votes from Con+DUP to pass it [1]. Given how the election went for Conservatives last time, I don't think they're eager for another one. And since there was already an election less than a year ago, it seems easier for anti-election MPs to explain away their votes against a snap election. In any case, there seems to be low support for a new election [2] --- out of 6 options, 16% said general elections are what should happen next. Still, if, as many predict, May's deal fails tomorrow in Parliament, and Labour proposes a no-confidence vote immediately, and it passes, then there is time for the elections to be held before deadline. That's quite a lot that needs to happen, but then again I've found Brexit to be very unpredictable, so I'll leave it at 33% for now --- but anticipate extremizing quickly over the next couple of weeks.

It would be technically impossible to have a referendum according to the UK rules by March 29th. \nIf the parliamentary vote on the Withdrawal Bill takes place on schedule January 15th the PM will (now, following today's amendment that was passed) have until Jan 21st to come up with a Plan B. If May does not have a Plan B and/or decides to resign the Conservative Party would presumably want to select as new leader. This would probably take a couple of weeks so lets say until Feb 5th, to have a general election would require a vote in parliament which presumably could take place while a new leader is selected, but realistically a general election probably could not take place until the beginning of March. At the same time that the Conservatives are selecting a new leader some new policies would be needed to deal with Brexit which would be in limbo, but parliament would need to do something to suspend A50 because a new government taking over in March would have no time to agree any new deal with the EU. \nSo having an election when one party is in the middle of an already chaotic situation would not really be in anyone's interest. It might seem that Labour might want to benefit from the Conservatives  being in chaos, but to have an election would require some Conservatives to vote for it. However much some Conservatives disagree with Mrs May, voting with the opposition for an election before they have elected their new leader, which they need to do before agreeing a new policy seems very unlikely.\nSo I see a more likely sequence (a) May's Deal voted down (b) by early February parliament (cross party agreement) to postpone the A50 leaving date. But to get the EU to agree the UK parliament would need to agree with the EU some substantive action on Brexit e.g. a referendum or a general election. I think to get a majority in parliament for this its more likely that it would need to be agreed that the Conservatives could take several weeks to change their leader and their Brexit policy before a general election took place.

The assumption (that seems to match what people tell me) is that if an election took place and Labour did not go into it as the party of Remain many Labour voters and particularly Party Member would desert it and vote LibDem (because they are clear that they support Remain). Labour saying they would respect the referendum and implement Leave would attract few votes from Conservative or any other party. \nThe Conservatives would run into big problems if an election was called and they said they would push for May's Deal because some of it voters and most of its Members would not vote for it. If the Conservatives said that No Deal was what they wanted then hardly anyone (except Party Members )would vote for them. And if Labour was clear they would push for either No Brexit or a very soft Brexit (e.g. Norway +) a sizable number of Conservative voters would switch from Conservative to Labour (or LibDem).  So having a General Election would be a very big risk for both main parties. To have a General Election would require MPs to vote for it. Mrs May seems determined to keep her deal in play for as long as possible, if she can do that for another 6 weeks or so there would no be time for an election.

A soft renegotiation is better for the EU than no deal, and the EU excels at fudging things, nothing is set in stone as we have seen many times, and recently for example Frances breaching of the budget deficit rules. The electoral commission has a statutory duty to take at least 12 weeks to examine what is a 'fair question' and that is presumably after the Government has decided what it wants to ask, which would be a massive fight in itself (remain, no deal, 'leave', Mays deal, EEA, ect - which question?) which given we are 85 days away from leaving, leaves me thinking this is very unlikely to happen (yes, Parliament could legislate around this, but that is another massive argument). There is a six week window for a general election, which could conceivable be fought between a pro brexit tory and labour parties vs remain lib dems/new party, so I will leave that as more likely for now.

The Tories's best bet is to get through Brexit, for May to resign, and then for a new PM to go to the country in search of another mandate for more normal domestic matters.  Likewise, the Tories also have a big incentive to avoid a second referendum, and I actually don't think Labour really benefit from one either, since it would take away their ability to play the \"strategic ambiguity\" card. There are legitimate concerns also that it would turn very ugly and corrode popular trust in the democratic process. A referendum would also have to be a far complicated affair than 2016, since simply re-running that vote achieves nothing if Leave won again - the UK would be stuck, as before. There would have to be multiple options on the table and a second preference voting system. Therefore, I'd say far the most plausible outcomes are a) that May's deal, perhaps in slightly amended form, surprises everyone by getting through the Commons due to Labour abstentions (not something Corbyn would be privately displeased about, for all that he'd have to be publicly enraged) or b) May's resignation, followed by an extension of the Article 50 period, something I imagine the EU would consent to fairly happily, given that the alternative is no-deal chaos, which benefits absolutely no one.

All routes to a referendum are complicated with several contentious steps, not least agreeing the wording of the question. GENERAL ELECTION \nI think that the most direct route to a general election is if the DUP withdraw from their confidence and supply agreement with the Tory Party, which could happen if Theresa May gets her Brexit deal through parliament on Tuesday 11 Dec 2018. In an interview [1] with Andrew Marr, Arlene Foster said \"If it came to the situation that parliament did decide, and there is no evidence they are going to, but if they did decide to back this deal then obviously we would have to review the confidence and supply agreement.\" However the DUP have a problem. If they cause a general election, they could lose the leverage they have now. Hence I think, Foster's measured statements. The DUP want to block May's deal, but not cause a general election. EDIT (3 Dec 2018)\nIn an interesting article [2] by Robert Peston published Fri 30 Nov 2018 he says about Theresa May \"If she truly means what she says, that she has no plan B, she will be gone as PM within hours of losing the vote - to be replaced by someone whose heart is in finding another route to avoid no-deal mayhem.\" [1] https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/brexit/dup-will-review-confidence-and-supply-agreement-if-theresa-mays-brexit-deal-passes-parliament-37563278.html\n[2] https://www.itv.com/news/2018-11-30/has-prime-minister-just-signed-her-own-warrant-of-execution/"], [51261, "2018-12-02T11:04:51Z", [0.75, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0], "The EU is playing hardball and many people in Britain appear to be backpedaling from their original vote of Brexit.
