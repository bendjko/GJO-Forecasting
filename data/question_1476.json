Furthermore, many of these are above the margin of error. These polls give Bernie an average support of 25%, which is only 1-2% less than the 26% needed to \"win\" Iowa. Furthermore, New Hampshire polls show surprising support for Tulsi Gabbard at around 4-6%. Tulsi supporters are very similar to Bernie supporters and when push comes to shove, I predict a fair number of them will vote Bernie for practical reasons on election night.  After Buttigieg's surprising performance in Iowa, he has captured media attention and has the \"momentum\" heading into New Hampshire. Newly released polls easily show this momentum with an influx of support by as much as 10%. Buttigieg has yet to overtake Bernie in the polls though. Moreover, it shouldn't be forgotten that Bernie did with the popular vote in Iowa, and the New Hampshire Primary will be decided by the popular vote. Furthermore, Bernie does have a semi-homefield advantage in New Hampshire, just as Buttigieg, as a midwesterner, had an advantage in appeal for Iowa. Buttigieg does not have this appeal in the rest of the early primary states. Therefore, It is plausibly that Buttigieg's momentum will continue to grow for him to overtake Bernie, but still unlikely. Biden's campaign took a real stumble after Iowa and while Biden was never polling great in New Hampshire, his numbers have crumbled since Iowa. It is highly unlikely his campaign will recover in the next week to win New Hampshire. Therefore, I predict that due to his negative momentum and previously losing polling numbers, there is no way Biden can win New Hampshire.  While Warren does have a semi home advantage in New Hampshire, especially among the more populous Southern New Hampshire, as is the case with all her polling, after her media craze before the new year, her poll numbers have predictably dropped into the mid teens in the early primary states. Furthermore, the polling data for her performance in Iowa was not terribly far off, leading me to believe that her polling data in New Hampshire won't be terribly far off either. On election night, she will probably have a resurgent swell of support, similar to Iowa, but it will not be enough to more than double her support. Therefore, I predict Warren also has no chance in winning New Hampshire.

Slightly different perspective than I\u2019d seen previously but ties a couple points together. FYI only\n\u201cThe Democratic Party is yet to hold its first presidential primary, but many would-be nominees have already surged, sagged or dropped out altogether. Joe Biden has been the front-runner ever since pollsters started asking primary voters about their intentions. But just behind him, there has been plenty of movement. Elizabeth Warren had a surge in the autumn, nearly but not quite catching Mr Biden; she has since fallen back. Next to enjoy a bounce was Pete Buttigieg, who benefited from Ms Warren\u2019s declining popularity among college-educated whites. His numbers have now slid a bit and Bernie Sanders is doing better. What explains these ups and downs?\nAlmost all of the variation in support for the different Democratic candidates so far can be traced to movement among white voters, particularly college-educated ones. According to YouGov\u2019s survey for The Economist of Democrats who say they intend to vote in the primaries, the group has oscillated wildly between support for Ms Warren, Mr Sanders and Mr Buttigieg. This has been the main group supplying Mr Biden\u2019s chief competitors\u2014Mr Sanders and Ms Warren\u2014with enough votes to be contenders. Ms Warren pulled in support from over 20% of college-educated whites at the start of the campaign, and currently wins nearly 30% of them. Mr Sanders has recently become the leading choice of whites without a degree.\nNon-white Democratic voters, by contrast, have been much more stalwart in their support for Mr Biden, especially those without college degrees. They have grown only more inclined to the former vice-president as the more progressive candidates have swapped places behind him.\nThis is, on the face of it, odd. During President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, white, liberal Democrats have become much more sensitive to racial injustice than they were when Barack Obama was president. You can see this in their increased awareness of racial discrimination as a barrier to economic and social progress. Yet when it comes to casting a vote in the primaries, they have avoided non-white candidates. They also favour more radical policies than do African-Americans. It used to be labour unions that acted as a counterweight to left-wing social movements within the Democratic coalition. Now it seems that African-Americans are playing that role. Without them, Ms Warren or Mr Sanders, not Mr Biden, would probably be the favourite.\u201c"], [41612, "2020-01-24T23:01:30Z", [0.35, 0.06, 0.54, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [20504, "2020-01-24T21:53:02Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [15953, "2020-01-24T21:12:37Z", [0.6, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [29502, "2020-01-24T21:04:10Z", [0.1, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75863, "2020-01-24T20:05:39Z", [0.25, 0.22, 0.36, 0.16, 0.01], ""], [56, "2020-01-24T17:59:59Z", [0.2, 0.03, 0.67, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [5053, "2020-01-24T15:58:44Z", [0.25, 0.22, 0.4, 0.1, 0.03], "Sanders appears to be leading, but the most recent poll (Suffolk)  is somewhat misleading. While it shows Sanders with a wide margin, the poll combines both individuals who both currently support a candidate or are \"leaning\" toward a candidate. The leaning voters could easily change their mind. Prior recent polling (without leaning factored in) shows a much closer race, with a large segment still undecided. Results in Iowa, where recent polls are few and appear to indicate a tighter race, could influence NH voters to a certain extent. Nevertheless, Sanders won by a large margin in 2016 and he is well-known in New Hampshire. The difference, however, was there were really only 2 viable candidates in 2016--Sanders and Clinton. Sanders consistently led in polling averages in the month leading up to the primary by 8-10 points, with increasing support as the election neared. He ultimately won 60/38%. Here, on the other hand, 4 candidates make the assessment more complicated, as Biden and Sanders carry less than 50% support (about 40-45%) between the two of them, with Warren and Buttigieg garnering close to 30%. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-6276.html\nSince the NH primary is only a week after the Iowa caucus, it seems unlikely that any of the four will drop out unless they do incredibly poorly.

Biden is third in fundraising behind Mayor Pete who, along with Elizabeth Warren, are currently both polling around at close to 15%.  It's too early to tell what impact Booker's exit might have.

This happened 3 out of 5 times (Obama 2012, Clinton 2008, Gore 2000), or 60%. So because Bernie Sanders is the lead fundraiser, I start with him at a 60% chance of winning the most delegates. While I'm going with this for now, to see where it leads, I do have some reservations: primarily that in most of the past NH primaries I cited, there were not SO many candidates with solid fundraising numbers. So I might reneg on this approach later.  Next for the inside view. Five thirty eight also has Sanders as the most likely to win, with Joe Biden a close second. For this I will give Sanders 5% extra since we\u2019re already starting with a pretty high base rate, and also reward Biden by putting him at 25%. The polls reflect this too, however Biden has been on a slight downswing and Bernie on an upswing over the past months. So I\u2019ll leave my forecasts as is for that. Other factors in Bernie\u2019s favor: he has a proximity to home state advantage, he just snagged a huge union endorsement, and he won the last NH primary. So I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m going to put Bernie above 70%.  However, Biden might find an extra boost from the fact that Bloomberg is not on the NH ballot and forecasts/polls do show him close to Bernie. So I want to give him a little extra for that.  Moving on to Buttigieg, he\u2019s seen huge upward momentum in New Hampshire, while he polls a little lower overall, so I don\u2019t want to ignore the way things are moving and want to give him some points for that. I want to give him 15%, but am starting to realize that my numbers will not add up and I need to look at the whole picture.\nBefore I do that, I\u2019ll turn to Warren. Based on polling, five thirty eight prediction, and fundraising, her chances look low considering that her primary policy competitor, Sanders, has the advantages I described above. So I will cap it at 10% as of now. And the other candidates: while I think there is momentum brewing that could change later races, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen before New Hampshire, based on polling data, considering that Yang did not qualify for the Jan 14 debate, and looking at fundraising data.  So in the end, I\u2019m using my intuition based on the factors I\u2019ve listed here to settle on the exact probabilities for my prediction.

Hence I expect Elizabeth Warren's vote share to fall and the other three to rise, as her supporters decide she won't win and thus vote for someone else. This is further backed up by her funding falling recently, indicating that her campaign is stalling. The question is then who her supporters will vote for, and Bernie Sanders is the most similar to her politically, especially on big topics such as the environment, education etc (ie the kind of issues which single issue voters will base their vote on). The big question therefore is whether Buttigieg or Biden can pull away, turning this vote into a two horse race, in which case I would expect that horse to beat Sanders. So far, as at star of Jan, this doesn't appear to be happening.  The other candidates' supporters - eg for Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang etc - I expect to split amongst the main candidates, but generally more towards Sanders, as New Hampshire seems relatively liberal and Warren is falling away.
