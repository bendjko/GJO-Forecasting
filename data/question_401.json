Therefore, I feel relatively removed from this awards season, as I can\u2019t discern what is a personal favorite.\nHowever, again I would like to acknowledge some pre-existing biases so you can take my forecast with a reasonable amount of salt: \u2022\tI have listened to 3 songs on the \u2018La La Land\u2019 soundtrack\u2026 the opening number is cute\n\u2022\tAs a person tired of lack of representation in Hollywood, I would personally prefer for a movie about two white people falling in love in a low-stakes situation to, y\u2019know, not win again Here I will try to predict BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS. I have zero familiarity with the women in this category and therefore don\u2019t have a personal favorite. Baseline\nI wanted to find a pre-Oscar award that usually accurately predicted the winner of an Oscar for my baseline. I looked at 3 big pre-Oscar awards for my baseline: the Golden Globes, the SAG awards (acting), and the Critics Choice awards. I compared their accuracy below: Start Time: 1995\nAltered Start Time: 2002 I chose 1995 as my initial starting point for data as that is when the first Critic Choice awards, the youngest of the three awards, were given out.\nData (# award winners who won Oscars and this award/#years):\nGG: 12/21 (57.143%)\nSAG: 14/20 (70%)\nCC: 13/21 (61.905%). Notice: I only counted 20 of the 21 winners for the SAG awards, b/c in 2000 Jennifer Connelly was sorted as a \u201clead\u201d actress for the SAG and won the Oscar for \u201csupporting\u201d. Given that she was in a different category all-together, I did not count that year against the SAGs. I notice a pattern in the last 14 years that the GG, CC, and SAG got better at predicting Oscars. Before then, they were not good. Considering the youth of the CC (founded 1995) and SAG (founded 1994) pre-2002, I decided to cut off my data at 2002 instead b/c a trend had formed 2002- onwards. Data: Last 14 years  SAG: 12/14 (85.714%), GG: 8/14 (57.143%), and CC: 10/14 (71.429%) accuracy. According to this data, SAG has most accuracy at 85.714%. That will be my baseline.\nBase: 85.714% for Viola Davis. BAFTA\nI will update on Feb 12 after the BAFTA\u2019s come out. If she wins that, she will have a CC, GG, SAG, and BAFTA, and that will change my prediction. Unique View\nInside view is hard for art b/c I feel like it\u2019s more subjective. I can\u2019t count screen-time: the awards are assigned regardless of screen time each actress has. \nI also feel like box office of a given movie won\u2019t help. Yeah, it\u2019s probably better for one\u2019s chances to come from a known movie, but does your movie need to be THE blockbuster of the year to score you the win? No. Alicia Vikander won last year, and \u2018The Danish Girl\u2019 was the lowest grossing of the movies her contenders came from save for \u2018Steve Jobs\u2019. I guess the stats on an individual actor will be what awards they win and that be it for predictions in this category. Given this unique view, in addition to the SAG metric I used for my base, she also won the GG and CC. 7/8 times since 2002 an actress won those three, they\u2019ve nabbed the Oscar. You could compare the awards in pairs also\u2026 either way you look at those numbers, winning one award increases your chances, but winning more than one helps even more. Unique view of Davis: her award history this year is indicative of future success. I\u2019m Wrong?\nMichelle Williams is looking good. She was nominated for the same things as Davis. Also, Williams won a Chicago, Santa Barbara, San Diego, New York, Toronto, and a Florida award over Davis. If it were to be anyone else, I\u2019d shoot for her. However, her lack of showing in 3 main awards, the CC, SAG, and GG which were swept by Davis is not a good tell. If she can wring out a BAFTA, that will cause some serious stir, but she has a good showing from small critic associations.\nHarris from \u2018Moonlight\u2019 looked like she nabbed two awards over Davis, but again these were small critic association ones. She\u2019s my 3rd. Conclusions\nBase: 85.714% Viola Davis. Michelle Williams adjust down (2% arbitrarily) vs. CC+SAG+GG (3% arbitrarily) win adjust up almost cancel out, but since the CC+SAG are hefty awards, her net adjustment will be up for Davis  86.714%  87%. 11% to Williams, 2% to Harris. Confidence\nI feel weird putting up such a high prediction for Davis, but she\u2019s got strong evidence.
