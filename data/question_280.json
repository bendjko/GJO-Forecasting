T adjust currency differentials to determine the actual value added of an Egyptian pound devaluation.

Egyptian travel statistics make clear there has been a nearly 45% reduction in 2016 vs 2015 numbers. October 2015  tourist arrivals show 900K. NB: A 10% increase is necessary to achieve MORE than 1mn  for October this year (FN1) I attach a 0% probability to this happening.  Here is why. First, the May 15th EGYPT-AIR flight MS 804 from Paris to Cairo disappearance & loss of all 66 persons on board has yet to be properly clarified. (2) NB UK foreign travel advise as per mid September for various regions in Egypt. ( 3).  In significant percentage numbers year on year, Europeans vacationing this year continue to avoid Egypt & N African along w/ Turkey both previous mainstays. (3a) Essentially here in Europe,  Paris, London, Berlin & Rome are out. Locations in Spain, Nordic lander and the like are in for European (we Swiss included).  Without doubt, the threat of additional TERRORISM on the ground or, in the air has left & continues through this year to leave a lasting impression on EU oriented vacations towards both locations. Secondly, the present rate of Egyptian INFLATION is at a record 8 year high of 16%, exclusive on the ground VAT.(4) More critically, it is only a matter of time b/f a  CURRENCY DEVALUATION takes place as Government authorities attempt to take hold of difficult economic conditions. (5)  Such a move further hurts consumers who are already suffering under increased VAT impositions &, lower industry subsidy. It is certainly more complex for  travelers attempting to adjust currency differentials to determine the actual value added of an Egyptian pound devaluation. BALANCED AGAINST the above mentioned, one can make a longer term case, Putin lifting Russian travel restrictions to both Turkey & Egypt will have a positive impact. NB: efforts now being made by Egyptian authorities to WOO BACK Russians w/ special airport privileges.(6). This however will take time.  Conclusion:  The Russians, Brits &, Europeans will return to Egypt. However, not 1mn in October. It will take more time.
