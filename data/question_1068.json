While this is not always the case, it is the general trend since October, 2011 (FY2012). \tFrom October to November 2018, the number of apprehensions rose. Since FY2012, this has only happened twice: FY2016, FY2018, and now FY2019. Using these two dates as a benchmark, we can compare the general trend based on this. What I did was calculate the number of FMUA and UAC apprehensions (at the two sites) out of the total number of apprehensions (at the two sites) for each November (2015, 2017, and 2018). In November 2015, FMUA/UAC\u2019s  (at the two sites) were 9.926% of total apprehensions. In Nov. 2017, they were 16.789%. In Nov. 2018, they were 14.972%. \tNext, I calculated the percent drop from Nov to Jan for each of these months. In 2015 it was 27.740%, and in 2017 it was 10.693%. Averaged, this is 19.217% which is the number I used for FY2019. According to this, Jan. 2019 should have approximately 41,891 apprehensions. \tThen, I calculated the average percent of FMUA/UAC (at the two sites) apprehensions out of the total number of apprehensions for January (similar to November). Jan. 2018 was 20.108% and Jan. 2016 was 15.091%. Averaged, this gave us 17.560%. Multiplied by our estimated 41,891 apprehensions, gives us 7,373 UAC apprehensions. \tIf we used the lowest percent drop (10.693%) and highest percent of FMUA/UAC (20.108%) for Jan. 2019, we get 9,312, which I used as the upper maximum. The minimum was 5,655. I believe due to the shutdown, the number will be in the upper 6,000\u2019s though could possibly scrape 9,000.
