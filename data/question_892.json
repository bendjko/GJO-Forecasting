These 2 were definitely California sites, but I couldn't figure out which.  I tried to use the Wayback machine to look at previous versions of the map, and it worked last time I did it, but this time it did not work.  Regardless, I highly doubt we will reach 45, but, I am already at 99%, have no idea why the 2 disappeared (which means they could re-appear just as easy), so I am leaving as is.\nEdit:  One of the ones that disappeared was Palo Alto, which was also one of the most recent to be added. Edit:  Re-found the info from California's website, which has now been updated as of the 11th of May.   https://cafcp.org/sites/default/files/h2_station_list.pdf The totals equal the federal website, except for one discrepency (Cal State), which is listed as \"commissioning\" on the Cal site.  There are two sites that are still possible in california that could be completed before July, Woodside and Burbank.  That would bring the total to 42.  So at least 3 of the 4 sites on the east coast would need to open.  I doubt this will happen, although my Aire Liquid contact was still vague upon last email when she stated, \"Hi Greg, The three sites were completed in the first quarter. They are not yet open to the public for use as we will open them officially with the launch of the vehicles. The app is scheduled to launch end of May!\" I asked her to explain the launch of the vehicles and timeframe, and she replied with, \"That, I would have to defer to Toyota on. I believe they are looking at the summer time, but I can certainly get a better time frame.\"   So I am currently waiting on her to get a reply from Toyota, but I am not as confident I will get an answer, as it requires someone else answering her.  I have a little concern that Summer is a vague answer, and this may possibly also mean June.  But, given the way all these questions seem to work, everything usually happens slower, not quicker, than I think it will.

Sometimes there\u2019s a wait at the pumps, but mostly the nozzles hang limp, devoid of cars to feed.\nOn the occasions when two or more cars line up to fill at the same time, the second car typically has to wait an extra few minutes after the first car is done, because gas pumped under high pressure begins to freeze a single pump\u2019s nipple, condensing moisture from the air into ice. Several newer, two-pump stations have helped address this problem, but California still needs more trucks to deliver supplies of hydrogen for the stations.

By the timeline provided, it shows everything listed as \"commissioning\" should be completed by 29 JUN, and even a project in LA in construction phase could make it.  On page 25 of the annual assessment (1) from CAFCP, it shows that there is an average of 261 days from beginning of construction to completion and availability to the public.  The LAX project started in May of 2017, So it is already beyond this point but still listed as \"under construction\"(2).   The same document(1) shows that organizations with construction completed should only have about 66 days to when the site is open to the public.  It is unclear though if the three sites listed as \"commissioning\"(2) are actually considered in \"Phase 4\", (the 66 day phase).  Phase 3 is described as, \"This phase includes station construction and meeting operational requirements: the station has a hydrogen fuel supply, passes a hydrogen quality test, dispenses at the H70-T40 pressure and temperature per standard (SAE J2601), successfully fuels one FCEV, and receives the occupancy permit from the AHJ.\"   So overall, it appears the three California sites listed as \"commissioning\" should get completed, giving a total of 43.  I am not more confident that other sites will be completed on the west coast, but I have no more information for the east coast sites.  (1) http://www.energy.ca.gov/2017publications/CEC-600-2017-011/CEC-600-2017-011.pdf (primarily pages 25-26)\n(2) https://cafcp.org/sites/default/files/h2_station_list.pdf"], [13064, "2018-03-07T12:39:31Z", [0.08, 0.6, 0.32], ""], [49545, "2018-03-07T03:40:43Z", [0.74, 0.26, 0.0], "I have received replies to questions for more information from both AFDC and California's CAFCP.  I have not received any replies from Air Liquide, the company primarily on the east coast, so the only information I have to update you with is for the California area.   To summarize, there are currently 40 listed on the AFDC website.  There is a discrepency with one (Cal State LA).  AFDC states its open, CAFCP states it is \"Under review\" in the \"Commissioning Phase\".  I asked how many of the \"commissioning phase\" (there are 4 including Cal State) that they thought would be completed by July.  The person replying stated that she would not give an estimate, as the process can take a long time.   Of these that are commissioning, their projected completion date was or is:\nAFDC/CAFCP\nCal State: *** completed/under review discrepency\nOntario: 1 January/Early Spring\nWoodside: 1 Jul/Early Spring\nThousand Oaks: 1 Jul/Early Spring\nOne other California site is scheduled to be completed by 1 JUL, but CAFCP still has them listed in the Planning (pre-construction) phase.  A note in another category leads me to believe the building process can take up to a year, so I doubt this one has an opportunity to be completed.   The above 3 (Ontario, Woodside, Thousand Oaks) are the best bet for completion in California, and there is a very slight chance that Cal State, which is on the list could potentially be removed (Very small).  So ultimately, at best, California can get +3 sites for a total of 43 sites.  Worst case scenario, they drop by 1 to 39, as no new sites are added and the Cal State site is removed.  This is highly unlikely, and my best guess is that the Ontario site is added while the other two do not make their 1 JUL milestone.   There are others we can see on the AFDC site that aren't listed on the CAFCP site, which is confusing, as you would think CAFCP would have a better idea of sites in California.  For example, AFDC has a site in Orange, CA, which is not listed on the CAFCP site.  It is showing last updated in early December, so maybe its been cancelled since? When I contact them again, I will ask.   There are only 2 on the east coast scheduled to be completed by the end date of this competition, 29 JUN.  One in Providence, RI (1 JAN), and 1 in Harford, CT (1 MAR).  I have no idea of the status of these, but will continue to work on it.  If my projection is correct, and only 1 of the three are completed in Cali, the east coast really doesn't matter.  If all three in Cali are completed, the both of these east coast projects have to be completed also.  This hits 45, the absolute minimum for the next category up.  This does not factor in the Orange, CA anomoly that is only listed on the Federal site, which, could add one more as it was scheduled for 1 MAR.   To  summarize, with apologies for redundancy:\n7 possibilities for completion, and my thoughts:\nOntario - CA: Past completion date, in \"commission\" Phase: Likely\nProvidence, RI: Unknown\nOrange, CA: Anomaly, not on California list but 1 MAR completion date on Fed: Possible\nHartford, CT: Unknown\nPalo Alto, CA: Completion date 1 JUL, listed in planning phase currently: Highly unlikely\nThousand Oaks, CA: Completion date 1 Jul, Commissioning Phase: Possible\nWoodside, CA: Completion date 1 JUL, Comissioning Phase: Possible\n25 Others listed as planned: Completion dates starting in December 18: Highly unlikely As a result, it would require 5 of the 6 of that I rated higher than \"unlikely\"; likely (1), unknown (2), and possible (3) to be completed and added.  I don't like the odds for all of 5-6 of these projects being completed, so as a result, I am going to significantly increase my Fewer than 45 by 25 points, reduce between 45 and 55 by 24 points, and reduce more than 55 by 1, giving it no chance."], [49545, "2018-03-06T21:45:18Z", [0.49, 0.5, 0.01], "Having received replies and initially looking at the data sent back from some of the organizations related to these projects, I have noted that more than 55 is not likely.

Articles from October talking about the completion of a site (3), but yet the site in Hartford on AFDC.energy.gov has it listed as incomplete, and has a different address.
