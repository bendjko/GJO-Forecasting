I can see that we only have estimates of the missile's range.  Maybe the moderators need more hard data before agreeing the missile could reach as far as Alaska or Hawaii (the minimum constraint).  But I am reasonably hopeful we have resolution unless this missile was an entirely different type than previous Unhas launched in the past.    Front-page news, DPRK launched a \"long range\" missile this Sunday.  Not sure about exact time, but its basically public knowledge.   Perhaps you have not resolved yet because the range is in dispute?  Sources I have found believe it is an Unha variant, and the Unha-2 (probably older version) appears to have sufficient range.  Herein is a range estimation:\nhttp://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nwgs/Wright-Analysis-of-NK-launcher-3-18-09.pdf\n...if used as a ballistic missile, it may be able to carry a 500 kg payload to a range of approximately 9,000 km... Another missile range estimate:\nhttp://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/north-korea-is-launching-a-rocket-soon-what-do-we-know-about-it\nThe range of a missile is based on the technology used and other factors. Whether the Unha-3 could carry a nuclear warhead depends in part on how heavy a North Korea nuclear weapon is, which is a topic of ongoing debate. If the Unha were modified to carry a 1,000 kg warhead rather than a light satellite, the missile could have enough range to reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii, but might not be able to reach the continental U.S. (Fig. 4). If instead North Korea could reduce the warhead mass to around 500 kg, the missile would likely be able to reach large parts of the continental U.S. The payload was listed at about 450 kilos.   All of these estimates would be enough to reach the Aleutians or Hawaii.   I think we are going to have to rely on estimates, given the path of the missile is going to be notably different for achieving satellite orbit than it would be for delivery of a nuclear weapon.

North Korea had earlier told the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) it would launch the rocket some time between Feb. 8 and Feb. 25, triggering international opposition from governments that see it as a long-range missile test. Japan and South Korea said North Korea had issued a Notice to Airmen that the launch would take place some time between Sunday and the following Sunday, Feb. 14. The IMO, a United Nations agency, also said on Saturday it had received a notification from North Korea of the change. Isolated North Korea says it has a sovereign right to pursue a space programme. But it is barred under U.N. Security Council resolutions from using ballistic missile technology. Tension has been high on the Korean peninsula following the North's fourth nuclear test, on Jan. 6. A rocket test now would compound fears about North Korea putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could reach not only South Korea and Japan but possibly even the west coast of the United States. North Korea last launched a long-range rocket in December 2012, sending into orbit an object it described as a communications satellite. The new time frame was set amid rising expectations that a launch was likely to happen soon, with U.S. government sources on Friday saying North Korea could be ready by the U.S. Super Bowl kickoff on Sunday, which will be Monday in Korea. Satellite images taken this week of North Korea's Sohae rocket launch site show apparent fuelling activity seen in the past shortly before a rocket launch, said Washington-based 38 North, a North Korea-monitoring project. North Korean state media has not reported on the changed schedule. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by telephone with President Xi Jinping of China, North Korea's main ally and neighbour, and agreed that a North Korean launch would represent a \"provocative and destabilising action,\" the White House said. Obama and Xi also said they would coordinate efforts to respond to North Korea's nuclear test last month and said they would not accept North Korea as a nuclear weapon state. \"The leaders emphasized the importance of a strong and united international response to North Korea's provocations, including through an impactful UN Security Council Resolution,\" the White House said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised North Korea in remarks made on Friday in Namibia, according to a report released on the Chinese foreign ministry\u2019s website, calling on the UN Security Council to take further action. The United States and China have appeared divided over how to respond to North Korea, with Washington urging tougher sanctions and Beijing stressing the need for dialogue.

The agency, the International Maritime Organization, said Tuesday that it had received a notification from the North Korean authorities of a multistage rocket launch between the hours of 7 a.m. and noon local time, on an as-yet unspecified day between Feb. 8 and 25. An agency spokeswoman, Natasha Brown, said North Korea\u2019s notification described the payload as an Earth observation satellite it called Kwangmyongsong, which translates as Lode Star. If the launch goes as planned, the notification said, the rocket\u2019s first stage will fall in waters off the west coast of South Korea and the second stage in waters east of the Philippines. The notification followed warnings to North Korea advising against a launch from the United States and allied nations, which consider such a step a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear bomb. Under a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions, North Korea is barred from developing nuclear weapons or ballistic missile technologies. North Korea had notified the International Maritime Organization of some earlier rocket tests. Another United Nations agency, the International Telecommunication Union, said Tuesday that it also had been notified by the North Koreans of an impending launch of the Kwangmyongsong satellite, but without specifying a date range. An agency spokesman, Sanjay Acharya, said it had been advised by Kim Kwang-chol, the North Korean minister of posts and telecommunications, that the satellite was designed to function for four years. North Korea insists that its rocket program is peaceful, aimed at launching satellites to gather data for weather forecasting and for other scientific purposes. But after the country successfully put a Kwangmyongsong satellite into orbit by using its Unha-3 rocket in December 2012, the United States worried that in the process, the North was also moving toward acquiring the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead on a long-range ballistic missile. That Unha-3, a three-stage rocket, blasted off from the Tongchang-ri launching site near the country\u2019s northwestern border with China. American and South Korean officials have been monitoring the site for signs of preparations for another rocket launch, especially after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6. The United States and its allies are working to muster international support for a new Security Council resolution imposing another round of sanctions against the North. They have expressed concern that the North might attempt a long-range rocket test in retaliation. In a report published last Thursday on 38 North, a United States website specializing in North Korea, Jack Liu, an expert on North Korea\u2019s rocket program, said it appeared to be \u201cin the early stages of preparation for launching a space launch vehicle.\u201d He used recent satellite images of the site for his analysis. South Korean intelligence officials said that in its 2012 rocket launch, North Korea was actually testing a design for a ballistic missile that could eventually fly more than 6,200 miles with a warhead of about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds, putting the West Coast of the United States in range. North Korea has recently completed renovating its Tongchang-ri site to be able to launch a rocket more powerful than any tested so far. Though it is widely believed to have at least several nuclear weapons, North Korea has never tested a missile that could deliver one beyond its home region. Some analysts have also said the North needed more tests to acquire the ability to produce a warhead that could survive re-entry from space, or one small enough to mount on a long-range missile. North Korea is preparing to celebrate the Feb. 16 birthday of Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-un, and a large congress of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in May. Some analysts have said that Mr. Kim wanted to show off advances in his nuclear and long-range missile programs ahead of those events. He has called for his country to develop and launch \u201ca variety of more working satellites\u201d using \u201ccarrier rockets of bigger capacity.\u201d As recently as last September, North Korea warned that \u201cthe world will clearly see a series of satellites of military-first Korea soaring into the sky.\u201d"], [16933, "2016-02-02T20:47:02Z", [0.87], ""], [3225, "2016-02-02T20:42:27Z", [0.96], ""], [102, "2016-02-02T20:14:03Z", [0.99], "Leaving 1% margin of error. http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2485529&language=en"], [498, "2016-02-02T19:00:13Z", [1.0], ""], [53, "2016-02-02T18:04:18Z", [0.98], "I guess the only question here is what they launch, and whether it will count as resolving this question.

Some chatter: (NKNews.org)  Business Insider noted in a January 6 article that \u201cIran has established ties to the North Korean nuclear-weapons program.\u201d North Korea expert Gordon Chang went further, raising the possibility in the Daily Beast that some Iranian officials may even have gone to witness the latest North Korean nuclear test...\" The Washington Times reported last September 15 that \u201cthe Iran nuclear deal is silent on an issue that the CIA and proliferation experts are concerned about: that Tehran may outsource parts of its nuclear and missiles program to the secretive regime in North Korea.\u201d  And, according to the Business Insider article, it \u201cwouldn\u2019t necessarily be a violation of the nuclear deal for Iran to access information from a North Korean nuclear test. Thomas Moore, a former non-proliferation expert for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Business Insider that he doesn\u2019t think that accessing this information would necessarily be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), either \u2026 possession of test data isn\u2019t specifically proscribed under a provision in the Iran agreement that addresses prohibited activities related to nuclear-weapons design.\u201d Dr. Larry Niksch, a 43-year veteran of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and currently with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), appeared as a witness before a House Committee hearing titled \u201cthe Iran-North Korea Strategic Alliance\u201d on July 28, 2015. Niksch, an expert on North Korea-Iran nuclear cooperation, testified concerning the use of Iranian funding to bankroll North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Niksch noted that \u201cafter 2011, I have seen a reverse flow from Iran into North Korea, expanding Iranian investment of personnel and money in North Korea\u2019s domestic nuclear and missile programs. Iranian missile scientists were stationed in North Korea for a large part of 2012, well into 2013, to assist North Korea in preparing for that successful 2012 long-range missile test.\u201d He further observed that \u201cIranian money appears to be the lubricant for North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The Iran nuclear agreement will increase Iran\u2019s wealth considerably as U.N. economic sanctions are lifted and Iran receives at least $50 billion from the United States in frozen assets.\u201d Source:  \nhttps://www.nknews.org/2016/01/will-a-post-deal-iran-outsource-the-bomb-to-north-korea/ Additional reading:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-nuclear-test-iran-deal-implications-2016-1\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/19/the-keys-to-iran-s-missiles-are-in-china-and-north-korea.html\nhttp://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/01/is_north_korea_testing_irans_nuclear_device_.html\n__________\nIran got the attention of the US again by unveiling another missile -- similar to the one PK aspires to develop:   (Jakarta Globe)   Iran unveiled a new underground missile depot on Tuesday with state television showing Emad precision-guided missiles in store which the United States says can take a nuclear warhead and violate a 2010 UN Security Council resolution.

This agreement implied that North Korea would receive regular shipments of the U.S. aid in exchange for its willingness to refrain from nuclear tests and missile launches.

In short, it was how they changed from a 3-stage to a 2-stage design.

However this tests if H- or non H are still very significant bad news.  my current -time-conclusions\nthe regime likes to overstate all their successes and down plays their failures. The cat and mouse game goes on and on. Whatever all others consider as bad-news is good news from the DRPK's regime perspective. The regime is a master in playing tactics to an extent that nobody believes them anyway, but the DRPK always knows how to get away with it, even the Chinese are getting increasingly tired of DRPK's games and are not eager that the DRPK is raising uncontrolled tension in the region on their own discretion. If the DRPK are technically capable or not, is difficult to understand for me, but it seems that they still face some considerable problems, else they would not have missed to use this achievement for the important 70th anniversary celebration.\nFrom a prestige point of view for next year there is no need to show a high profile \"success\" shortly before the yearly celebrations, since it is only year 71.

Dec 22: \"North Korea shows off new ICBM\" --> http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/22/l-todd-wood-north-korea-shows-new-icbm/ EXCERPT: North Korea displayed a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), different from designs shown during 2012 and 2013, during a recent military parade in Pyongyang. Although the new missile\u2019s performance is probably unchanged from previous models, the reliability is most likely greatly improved. The technology heavily borrows from Soviet designs but the new characteristics could very possibly have been taken from technology spirited out of Ukraine. Several North Korean operatives were recently arrested in Ukraine attempting to photograph riveting technology documents at a Ukrainian weapons plant, which could have been used in the new weapon system. The third stage of the missile has been removed and the warhead replaced with a more blunt design. This allows for a lower weight and greater survivability during re-entry but makes it more susceptible to missile defense systems. It is also less accurate, according to the website 38north.org. With a lighter warhead, the new missile will have a range of approximately 9,000 km which would enable North Korea to target the U.S. West Coast. Since the new design is simpler and more reliable, it is seen as a more credible threat. The design change, and needed flight testing, could delay the new missile\u2019s operational capability until 2020 or beyond. North Korean work on a new mobile ICBM is ongoing but has been slower than expected. ~~~~ COMMENT: Based on my understanding of the \"more info\" tab (A launch for military or testing purposes would count, The success of the launch, and the actual distance traveled, are irrelevant.), if there is an attempted launch of the ICBM described in this article, that would resolve this question in the affirmative. ~~ Here's a second article on the same topic, but with an important quote.

North Korea rocket site upgrade close to completion: research report\nRead more at Reutershttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-rockets-idUSKBN0TS2QF20151209#35VMKYit4y8FKAQ0.99 North Korea appears close to completing an upgrade of its rocket launch site at Sohae, which could be ready to launch larger rockets from the beginning of 2016, a U.S. research institute said on Wednesday, citing recent satellite images. North Korea has tested three nuclear devices in defiance of international sanctions and is thought to be trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile mounted with an atomic warhead that could hit targets in the mainland United States. A report on 38 North, a website run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, said commercial satellite imagery from October and November showed construction of new propellant bunkers at the launch pad and engine test stand at the Sohae Satellite Launch Station. It said these appeared to be \"near completion, signifying what is likely the end of a three-year upgrade program.\" \"That program is probably designed to support future activities related to the testing and launching of larger rockets,\" the report said. It said the upgrades meant North Korea would be ready to conduct such launches \"by the first quarter of 2016 should the leadership in Pyongyang decide to do so.\" Pyongyang says its rocket launches are part of a legitimate space program aimed at putting satellites into orbit. In September its space agency said it was building a new satellite and readying it for launch. Analysts say such a launch could signal an advance in extending the range of a ballistic missile or in increasing the weight of any weapons payload. North Korea also said in September that its main nuclear complex was operating and it was working to improve the \"quality and quantity\" of weapons which it could use against the United States at \"any time.\" On Tuesday, the United States added North Korea's Strategic Rocket Force to its sanctions list for ties to weapons development and illicit finance activities. It said the Strategic Rocket Force was responsible for a series of ballistic missile launches in 2014 including two medium-range Working-class missiles in March last year.

I give even chances for both, but based on wording of the question suspect it may be resolved conservatively. First, I think it's even chances that North Korea will attempt to garner world attention within the next 14 months, with the best timing of an event to be December 2016 (5 year anniversary of Kim Jong-il's death and Kim Jong-un's ascension to leadership, and 5 months after the next South Korean National Assembly is inaugurated). However, reporting that suggests Jong-un's differences from his father may mean more practical scenarios for theater warfare to provoke South Korea, Japan and China (the support from which will by then be diminishing due to the Chinese economic slowdown), which makes me lean towards an IRBM or a mobile launcher test. So, it would be a KN-08 in some form. A longer-range test meant to clearly demonstrate an ability to strike the US directly would wait until a crisis develops, which won't happen until the inauguration of the next US executive after the closing of this question window. Second, the question is somewhat indeterminate because some experts claim that North Korea has already achieved this (launched a missile with the capacity to reach Alaska and beyond), such as with the Taepodong-2 and the Unha orbital rocket. Experts differ based on assumptions of fuel type, staging, warhead type & mass, and target impact potential. Since these rockets appear to be ruled out as orbital-only under the assumption that they can't attack the US (a dangerous assumption), then that leaves us with the KN-08, which best assumptions suggest will use a propellant that limits it's range to less than US strike distance, but could strike the US with higher performing propellant. Note: I'm less inclined to think North Korea will construct and test ICBMs to target US cities because their technology arcs suggest that the use of their limited resources (orbital rockets, short range sub-launched rockets, and miniaturization of low yield nuclear weapons) is to develop the capability for a High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse attack."], [368, "2015-10-27T19:01:00Z", [0.9], ""], [6552, "2015-10-27T12:32:51Z", [0.0], ""], [9131, "2015-10-27T11:27:00Z", [0.9], "Strong possibility for a missile reaching Hawaii or Alaska but not continental USA"], [9915, "2015-10-27T06:52:40Z", [0.05], ""], [9916, "2015-10-27T06:52:03Z", [0.55], "they probably will launch such a missile... but not in this timeframe.."], [9180, "2015-10-27T06:36:16Z", [1.0], ""], [9902, "2015-10-27T05:31:42Z", [0.55], ""], [7091, "2015-10-27T03:15:44Z", [0.85], "North Korea thinks its wise to be unpredictable and to appear to be dangerous.

According to the FAS, the Taepodong-2 has been tested only once,  5 July 2006, but exploded only 40 seconds into its flight. North Korea has alleged that its Taepodong-1 emplaced a satellite into orbit. However, the reality is that The Taepodong-1 has been test flown only once, on 31 August 1998. Although the first two stages were successful, the third stage is believed to have exploded, preventing the satellite from being placed into orbit. These two data points don't do much to illustrate a base rate other than that North Korea only rarely tests rockets with intercontinental ranges, and never since Kim Jong Il's death. That said, the question is not about a successful launch, but rather one reported by the media as having the potential to be an ICBM. So, how likely is it that North Korea's rocket scientists would risk another failed launch? If lucky, the launch would fail out of Dear Leader's sight, as with his father in 1998. Given news of the recent summary execution of the manager of a terrapin farm, apparently stemming from an electricity supply problem over which he had no control, the rocket scientists could be expected to work hard at extending their lives. Given the inherent problems of developing rockets in an environment where tests occur rarely, the best strategy would be to not test at all. That said, in recent years, several news stories of executions have been proven false by the alleged victims appearing in public. So this analysis of reluctant rocket scientists might be in error.

The first question can be answered with a high degree of certainty according to various open sources. The second question appears to be answered, but only slightly. According to the Center for Arms Control & Non-Proliferation' Fact Sheet, NK is alleged to have a medium-range missile capable of reaching the continental US (Taepodong-1 and/or Rodong / Nodong-1). The missile was tested in 1998 with partial success. But the Taepodong-2 is currently under development with the capacity to reach any of the stated countries and was tested five times between 2006 -2013 (as noted by @sanxiyn). @sanxiyn gives a high forecast of 75% (w/ justification), but this does not take into account varying changes in geopolitical relationships which could change the regime's calculus in the meantime. NK has publicly stated its desire to reach a peach settlement with the US, however NK did note that, \"If the United States insists on taking a different path, the Korean peninsula will only see our unlimited nuclear deterrent being strengthened further.\" This I believe gives credence to @sanxiyn's high forecast, but China's recent disapproval of NK's missile testing over the years makes me think NK may lower their aggressive stance and re-frame from testing any missile (w/ the stated capability) over the next year.

Given that, I am increasing my probability estimate of such a \"launch\" based upon the following articles showing additional construction of new facilities for oxidizers and other propellants at the Sohae facility: http://38north.org/2015/10/sohae100915/ Pertinent portions of the article: \"Examining the October 4 imagery, new fuel and oxidizer storage buildings have been discovered near the old structures adjacent to the launch tower...Whether these new structures will be used for the storage of additional fuel and oxidizer or for more volatile propellants remains unclear.

Keep in mind that the gathering of intelligence by interested third parties based upon telemetry may be useful to a point; after which a \"catastrophic failure\" may occur.  Thus while it may be considered a \"successful launch\" by parties collecting said data, it fails the primary test of delivering a re-entry package to a designated point and as such is an actual test failure from the standpoint of the DPRK. Thus, absent any clarification, I will have to presume anything that at least does not explode immediately at the launch site to be a \"successful launch\".

Satellite and missile experts worldwide believe that this is a cover story (a lie). That\u2019s because of a similar launch in December 2012 where North Korea used a similar rocket to put a malfunctioning satellite in orbit. That was soon found to be a cover for an ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) test. The rocket used could easily be reprogrammed to travel up to 10,000 kilometers and reach most of the United States while carrying a half ton warhead. South Korea recovered many components of the rocket (the first two stages fell back to earth in international waters) and engineers were able to study the pieces, as well as satellite photos of the rocket before launch. South Korean engineers found the construction of the missile components retrieved to be sloppy and there were some foreign components in the rocket. International sanctions do not allow for the North Korean launch and there have been more sanctions as a result of this scam. North Korea pitched the rocket launch to its people as a major achievement. But since most had little electricity or heat when the 2012 launch took place, morale did not improve much. Most North Koreans eventually found out that it was actually a forbidden ICBM test pretending to be a failed satellite launch. North Korea has made it clear that the threat of more sanctions will not have any effect if there is another such launch in 2015. North Korea is trying to develop a reliable ICBM that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Some intel analysts believe that the North Korean Taepodong (KN-08) ICBM is actually ready for service and can be launched from a large truck. This mobility makes it more difficult to find and destroy. The October test is needed to improve reliability because North Korea cannot afford to build a lot of these rockets for an attack on the United States so every one of them will count. The Taepodong has a range of 9,000 kilometers, meaning it can reach the west coast of the United States. While mobile the Taepodong is still a three stage liquid fueled rocket and that means days are needed to get one ready for launch. The North Koreans has long sought to develop an ICBM that can hit the U.S. with a nuclear weapon. In response to that the United States has already deployed an anti-missile system in Alaska specifically to stop any such North Korean attack. For the North Koreans to launch a successful attack they would need at least a dozen Taepodong missiles and be able to launch them simultaneously. If that happened, one or two might get through. But since the Taepodong is a liquid fueled missile, the lengthy launch preparations would alert the United States, who could then use ICBMs or bombers to destroy the Taepodongs before they were ready to go. Thus as a threat to the United States, the Taepodongs are a failure. But the next stage of ICBM development involves using solid fuel rockets, which can be launched without any warning. That is what North Korea is working towards as well as a reliable nuclear warhead design. Ally Iran has made considerable progress in developing large solid fuel rocket motors and that technology would be available to North Korea. Iran got this tech from Pakistan, who got it from China who got it from Russia which stole it from the United States. North Korea and Iran have cooperated in the past on weapons development and are believed to still be at it, in secret.

Rose, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance for the Institute for Corean-American Studies (ICAS) in a speech to the State Department, the capacity to do so exists. (Rose, 2015).  He goes on to say: \"(I)n 2012 North Korea placed a satellite in orbit with its Taepo-Dong space launch vehicle, which could be used as a ballistic missile. Furthermore, at a parade in Pyongyang in 2012, the regime unveiled what appeared to be a mobile ICBM (KN-08) with a range purportedly capable of reaching the United States. In addition to this ICBM, North Korea also has an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has not been flight-tested, but that is potentially capable of holding Guam and the Aleutian Islands at risk.\" The capacity is present, and the question in this discussion asks of capability, not accuracy. Further, there is no mention in the question as to the missile defined as carrying a  nuclear payload, but if a land based missile in and of itself, has the capacity (or potential) of reaching any of the 50 states when theoretically launched. Capacity is defined as the actual or potential ability to perform.  So the logic implies, based on Assistant Secretary Rose's statement, that a satellite in orbit has the capacity to become a weapon with the potential to hit the US. It is as if DPRK had a SAC bomber it flew around the world, it does not have to detonate a bomb, only demonstrate the capacity to to so. So the question becomes, will DPRK launch a satellite before 01/01/2017? According to FAS, North Korea and Iran have cooperated on the technical aspects of missile development since the 1980s, exchanging information and components. Reportedly, scientific advisors from Iran\u2019s ballistic missile research centers were seen in North Korea leading up to the December 2012 launch and may have been a factor in its success. There are also signs that China may be assisting the North Korean missile program, whether directly or through tacit approval of trade in sensitive materials. Heavy transport vehicles from Chinese entities were apparently sold to North Korea and used to showcase missiles in a military parade in April 2012, prompting a U.N. investigation of sanctions violations (Chanlett-Avery, Rinehart, Nikitin, & Paek, 2015). How much will Iran further assist DPRK without losing credibility with the US and the West? Could they arm DPRK as a way to extract more demands from the West or is that too risky? Could they use proxies to arm them as a way to access more revenue? Could Russia do it for identical reasons since they are not having sanctions lifted and are losing ground in Ukraine? Will China continue to arm them or are they becoming rather tired of DPRK's strategy and does a satellite missile amount to a threat on China's territory?  It would seem more plausible that a satellite could launch and act as land based missile, or with the \"potential\" of being a missile and that would answer the question as yes if DPRK launched before 01/01/2017. This way, with a satellite launch that has a perceived or potential ability of being a missile, DPRK could demand being recognized as a nuclear power without great repercussions because the DPRK could say they did not launch a missile, whether or not it is true. Then request more 6 way talks, although it is doubtful the West would agree to their request.   Before sending this forecast, I did a last search with another search strategy and discovered this news story and am including it as it further supports my forecast: North Korea indicated on Monday that it was preparing to put a new satellite into orbit using a rocket that is widely seen as an intercontinental ballistic missile in the making...Officials and analysts in the region have speculated that the North will launch a long-range rocket with a satellite on board around Oct. 10, the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party. The country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been seeking to build his prestige with advances in rocketry and missiles, they say. North Korea has said its space program is peaceful, and the aerospace official quoted by the state news agency, Korean Central News Agency, said the satellite would gather data for weather forecasting. But after the country put a small satellite into orbit in December 2012, the United States and its allies worried that in the process, the North was learning how to build long-range ballistic missiles that could strike targets as far as the West Coast of the United States. ( Choe, 2015). The Black Swan is whether the satellite properly makes it off the pad or Kim is in power when they launch a missile, though the former may fail before the latter, they are not consistent in successful space  launches.  The question becomes like the Reeses peanut butter chocolate debate: (a) Is it a destructive missile carrying a satellite for guidance or (b) a satellite taken up to space by missile?  It is a matter of semantics that defines whether (a) it was launched from the ground or (b) staying up there much longer until it is launched from the satellite,  but the capability definition is not effected by it.  \n                                                                                                References Chanlett-Avery, E., Rinehart, I.

Previous satellite launches have used long range rockets that meet the criteria for the question, (eg. see the NYT article linked under \"More Info\").  Success and actual distance traveled do not affect the question outcome. Of the previous 4 satellite launches (1998, 2009, 2012 (April and Dec)), the last three were announced/warned prior to launch.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unha) No specific date was given for the 2009 launch (as far as I know), but dates were given in 2012.   I don't know if there is a time that DPRK has said it would launch a satellite and then not done so.  Looking for that info still.   At this point, no specific date for a launch has been given, there is just a lot of conjecture that it could occur around the October 10 anniversary.

DPRK has also made statements about its nuclear program... in the past (2009 and 2012/13) satellite launches have been followed by nuclear tests.  Maybe this is better said: nuclear tests have been preceded by satellite launches. (I suppose as a warning.) If North Korea were to announce that it was going to launch a satellite, I would take them at their word and give a high probability here, under the assumption that the rocket used would meet the question criteria.
