This chimes with reports from back in March [1], before a number of humiliating gaffs, sleaze and corruption charges, the results of the Scottish elections, impactful losses in Tory heartlands and growing mutterings of rebellions amongst a previously solid voting majority [2]. It speaks to an impossible conflict between what the Clown Prince will need to do to stay in power and the decisions he will need to make to not preside over another appalling Coronavirus surge in the UK (one that even his most ardent supporters may find hard to ignore).  The near inevitability of another lockdown and restrictions being re-imposed faces off over Tory MP intractability which seems more and more to be aping some of the more extreme positions taken by their counterparts in the US Republican Party (but without the rabid, unquestioning and near religious loyalty that their US counterparts enjoy from their voting base). These two impossible issues are squaring up to each other across Johnson's desk, making for a very interesting summer of increasingly desperate double speak from the floppy haired premier, back room dealing and manoeuvring within the Tory party and mounting pressure being applied through tabloids and \"friendly\" Tory media (not forgetting that \"it was the Sun wot dun it!\" to Hancock a few weeks back).  That said, BoJo the Wonder Clown and his particular brand of pseudo-incompetent authoritarianism has proven unprecedentedly resilient to these sort of threats before and September is not far away (but it would only take a single press release for Boris to suddenly throw in the towel in a last hurrah of headline grabbing aplomb after a back room conversation with his Tory handlers convinces him to jump before he is pushed).

Allegations begin again today, with headlines \"let the bodies pile up in their thousands\" representing this week's opening salvos [1].  It seems likely this is only going to get worse for the PM who is falling foul of the most Tory of Tory behaviours: inside dealing, corruption and self serving greed. Tory Leaders of history have found this to be their kryptonite, but today's world is different and today's UK populace seem strangely willing to accept such things in favour of something that Boris brings them in return (whatever that is...not sure anyone knows now that Brexit is done). To see the headline appear in the Mail, however [2]?  That feels like something different and shows that today's revelations are not being buffered by the traditionally Tory friendly broadsheet outlets.  The fact that all this is coming out in the weeks before the May elections is not, I believe, any form of coincidence.  The question therefore is why?  Why would a normally Tory and Johnson friendly paper pile in on such headlines and turn on \"their man\" in such a way?  We'll come back to that in a second. With Scottish elections likely to represent a drumming for Johnson's premiership as well, I wonder if my earlier premise about party insiders looking for \"an opportune moment to throw him off the White Cliffs\" now that Brexit is done might still hold some water. If there was a moment for a leadership crisis to be punted: a scandal ridden premiership that has just been given a whipping in local elections and looks like it might oversee the break up of the union might be just the moment such malign entities within the Tory Party would be looking for. As stated in my earlier rationale (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/1211213) the ideal moment for the Tory party to commit to \"BJexit\" would seem to be later on in the term and closer to the next election (2022 or early 2023) when they can blame the losses and disasters of Brexit at his door before entering a \"clean\" candidate into the next election cycle. But the fact remains that the ice under Boris' feet is still wafer thin with very little room for manoeuvre or options to keep everyone happy.  If the ERG and Brexit hardliners in the various right wing UK media outlets (of which the Mail is definitely one) are feeling that their Clown Prince is caving (despite the press briefings and bombastic pronouncements) to EU and US pressure on NI protocols etc. [3] then these revelations suddenly take on a whole new meaning and a whole new projection for BJs future. This could also just as easily be the moment Gove (possibly in collaboration with his old partner in crime Cummings) has smelt sufficient blood in the water to make his vengeful move with support from his his wife's tabloid [4]. This is what happens to populist \"finite game\" players who lack the foresight, cognitive capacity and basic interest to play the \"long, infinite\" game and make policy on long standing, deeply held \"principles\" rather than flop around in a desperate effort to hold onto power.  You get yourself boxed into a corner with few good ways out.  Boris' history speaks of a man who doesn't like admitting any form of failure and never wants to face up to the hard choices of a \"no win\" scenario.  But like it or not, it seems that a no win scenario has caught up with him and those around him may now be smelling blood. Its a really hard one to forecast, particularly if you base all or most your forecasting evidence on what's in the media and the papers (which have been bailing furiously to keep Johnson afloat over the last 9 months).  I remain convicted that, for this question, its a mistake to not also take a good look at the ice beneath Johnson's feet and the heavily constrained environment in which he's currently flip flopping along [5]. The key part of this question is the date and the timing.  I do not see Johnson leading the Tories into the next election.  But can the momentum, outrage and pressure build in time to see Johnson's cork finally blow before this parliament's summer recess? If the May elections don't go as badly for Johnson as some current predictions suggest (both North and South of the Scottish border) then I think he's safe and forecast probability goes back down to near 0.  But if things go badly...we should all be listening very carefully for the sound of knives being sharpened (and Gove's back teeth chattering in glee).

In the short term, this has shown that the perception by the UK Government, led by Boris Johnson, to have made the right decision in leaving the single market and its lamentable, business/procurement methods.\nThe next issue to be faced by Boris Johnson is the demand of the SNP to gain a second independence referendum. He believes in the Union albeit he is not popular in Scotland and the Conservatives (or Labour) look unlikely to win anything north of the border.\nAccording to the polls Scottish are +/- 50% to vote yes/No for independence, but it appears that a vote in England for the same would be to vote for Scottish independence. So, this, if true, should not affect Boris\u2019s popularity.\nThe third issue and potential danger for Boris is his party\u2019s backbenchers who do have the form and capability to unseat their leader if ideology is transcended; there have been rumbles of discontent over lack of basic freedoms due the duration of  pandemic lockdown by politicians and media commentators.

Reading between the lines and behind the rhetoric of Andrew Bailey's statement's [1 and 2] its hard not to get a sense of impotent panic in the BoE's (non-political?!) position on London's financial services, access to the EU derivative market and the time limited equivalency allowance. Sidebar: Andrew Bailey [3] was a very public supporter of Brexit [4], which I'm sure had absolutely no impact on his ascension to the position of Gov of the BoE in March 2020 after the tenure of the highly competent, highly capable (and quietly appalled [5]) Mark Carney. For all the noise and foot stamping going on, there doesn't seem to be many credible avenues for the BoE to \"resist\" the changes that the EU have been wanting to make for the last decade or more [6 and 7] but couldn't get their proposals past...the EU Court of Justice (we Brits do love a decent dose of irony in our daily diet). Now, thanks to Boris' Brexit, the EU have been granted the golden opportunity to reclaim huge amounts of London's financial power and derivative advantage that they were always looking for but could never achieve whilst the UK was an EU member state.  And it was the UK who voluntarily gave it to them (\"will of the people\", \"Brexit means Brexit\" etc. etc.). Is this relevant to this question?   Well, an \u20ac83.5tn slice of a \u20ac681tn market is not an amount to be sniffed at!  But given that the current EU granted equivalency deadline expires in June 2022 (and given BJ's propensity to leaving complex and high impact negotiations on key parts of the UK economy to the last second) it's hard to see a DIRECT route to this additional \"Brexit dividend\" unseating the Clown Prince within this question's 2021 timeframe. That said, once London's financial sector gives up on pressuring the now impotent BoE and the political appointee at its head to save their incomes, who might they point their very well funded (and traditionally Tory Party donating) ire towards next?  And how might they start expressing that ire towards a Government and a Party that has seriously undermined their bottom line with their flagging Brexit white elephant? As before, May 2021 feels like the next date to keep a keen eye on for this question.  If the city decides that the current short term focused, populism driven, incompetently managed and increasingly desperate UK government are an unresolvable blocker to their financial survival they may start exercising their considerable clout to asymmetrically topple the Clown Cart. Within 2021's timeframe (and remembering that negotiations for such a complex issue will take time and effort to conclude before the June 2022 equivalency expiry) May's Scottish Election results (predicted to be a damning reflection of BJ's \"Union\" leadership) might be the opportunity they choose to kick the stool out from under him (probably via behind the scenes pressure on the Party that backs him and relies so heavily on their continued patronage). Whilst short term pandemic and vaccination headlines dominate above the waterline of UK public consciousness (and seem to drive much of the probability forecasting here) the ice below the surface that's holding BJ and his Government up appears wafer thin and with fewer and fewer traditional Tory Party foundations holding it together. Its also critically important to remember that BJ is not Trump, and whilst BJ's approval ratings are stabilising in the near term absolutely no one in the UK will be storming the Houses of Parliament with St George flags and MUKGA hats if Johnson were to be unceremoniously booted from Downing Street tomorrow (Pro Brexit marches in 2019 only ever hit a few thousand [8] whereas anti-Brexit protests in 2019 reached several hundred thousand to +1million [9]). The sudden and unannounced departure of a failing (panicking) populist leader can happen in a second with the right stimulus and these are, to use the popular trope, \"unprecedented times\".  The trick for this question is identifying WHAT stimulus event(s) will cause their power base to shatter, and WHEN it/they might come.   I can't wait to see what people on here come up with if this question gets a Mulligan for 2022!

This rather astounding capitulation from the opposition seems to indicate that Starmer is in no rush to chase down easy prey and is instead content to play a longer game (pushing any chance of such scandals feeding back on the PM further out of this question\u2019s time frame). If his political calculus regarding the public mood is right then it seems the UK public is unlikely to rise up in fury at the waste of public funds on Tory friendlies.  Ergo, no willing or induced departure due to public furore any time soon. If his political calculus is wrong then this is a missed opportunity to bloody the Government\u2019s nose with a topic that may be more raw in the public\u2019s mind than his strategists believe (those with enough curiosity to find out about it: UK print media worked overtime to focus attention away and onto the shiny thing of \u201cHarry and Megan\u201d over the weekend).  Polling will show the impact of this scandal in subsequent months (on both the Governments behaviour and the Labour leaders willingness to let this one go)).

Whichever reason is true, the opposition to BJ don\u2019t seem to be in any hurry or working particularly hard to unseat him through public anger with these sort of opportunities.  Which means the Tory Party are going to have to do it themselves and on their timeline (unless Boris hears the knives being sharpened and jumps before the push comes: seemingly less likely this side of the questions closure).  So, for now, the May Scottish elections remain the only major event to watch and recalculate from for this question, and whatever the results with this it seems much more likely than not that Boris will ride out the questions time frame with his refusal to grant Scotland an IndyRef 2 and hope it all goes away (always a short term thinker that one).

The article's analysis of the impact the Scottish May elections may have on BJs future, and his potential \"BJexit\" expiry date after the results come in and before the Autumn conservative party conference (seemingly October '21) are especially interesting. The Johnson and Conservative friendly media are currently making as much hay as possible from the superficially positive vaccine rollout progress (and working hard to play down the newly published vulnerability the Ox/AZ vaccine has to the South African variant) which seems to be keeping BJs head above water for the moment. But May's Scottish election results and the growing volume of voices raising alarm at the economic struggles of post-Brexit Britain [2 & 3] will be very hard / impossible to sweep under the carpet come the Conservative Party's 3rd - 6th October 21 conference in Manchester [4] (assuming it goes ahead). It may be that the Tory party decides, post Scottish election results & opinion polling come in but before the SNP manoeuvring for IndyRef 2 really gets going, to eject (or persuasively retire [5]) Johnson as an offering to Scottish swing voters (with Sunak polling very strongly amongst them) and as their best chance of keeping the Union together [6]. The vaccine programme may be giving BJ a current bunt in opinion polling but the question we need to ask for this question is how resilient it is in the face of what's coming in Q2 & 3 2021 and how long will it last?  The conditions that surround his premiership still appear incredibly fragile and there aren't many good news stories on his or his government's immediate horizon to give him solid long term prospects. I fear the crowd average on this question is giving great weight to the right leaning UK print media's PRESENTATION of Boris and the current Conservative government and paying significantly less attention to the cracking ice beneath their feet.

The break in positive public opinion and the general dissatisfaction in UK government performance will probably be seen as tolerable by the Tory Party for now, hoping that the COVID vaccine programme will be a saving grace after hitting the 100k death toll threshold (a likely influencer over the polling period).  For the Party as a whole this will likely remain something to act on closer to the 2024 election when a new fresh faced Conservative leader may offer a chance to reset the downwards trend (standby for #blameitonBoris, #BJexit etc. etc.). If this downward opinion trend steepens or sharpens for any reason (watch May's Scottish elections and the impact on UK Government opinion polling that follows) the Tory Party may be forced to start wondering if the damage caused by keeping Boris on until 2022 / 2023 will become irrecoverable by 2024's election.

The emboldening effect this has will have had on the Brexiteer mindset (with amplifying effect from the right leaning bias of the UK print media) cannot be over-stated: the single data point validation of their emotive crusade in spite of the growing number of examples of Brexit induced deprivation and hardship.

A poorly thought through political move by the EU (induced by some fair reasoning and some political and bureaucratic desperation on their part) may have suddenly turned it into his greatest political gift. BJ and his governments trend of mismanagement and reactive responses seems entirely likely to continue and the fallout from Brexit will become more and more apparent as the next year progresses (but likely a political slow bleed as opposed to a single fatal wound).  There are still signs of traditional Tory Party back biting and manoeuvring behind the scenes but with the UK now looking more like a vaccine success story (a useful white wash for the appalling death rate) and with the EU\u2019s diplomatic and political miss step ringing in the ears of UK news readers, the emboldenment of the Brexiteer spirit seems likely to assure his short term future for the moment. https://youtu.be/O29uAq7EDMY\nhttps://news.sky.com/story/what-is-article-16-and-why-did-the-eu-make-a-u-turn-after-triggering-it-12202915\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-coronavirus-vaccines-northern-ireland-b1795037.html"], [1333, "2021-01-30T12:59:33Z", [0.45], ""], [96831, "2021-01-30T03:50:30Z", [0.06], ""], [94872, "2021-01-30T01:32:57Z", [0.03], ""], [80790, "2021-01-29T21:29:38Z", [0.11], ""], [91561, "2021-01-29T19:25:23Z", [0.09], ""], [89038, "2021-01-29T16:41:22Z", [0.04], ""], [98097, "2021-01-29T15:15:01Z", [0.01], ""], [98097, "2021-01-29T15:14:22Z", [0.02], "I'm bearish on this, but not at zero because of mortality and illness.

Whilst conditions for BJ remain very fragile I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I\u2019d not properly factored / weighted for: -The heavy Tory bias in UK media that will help spin messaging and cushion damage of continued reporting on corruption [2], incompetence etc.  Majority of today\u2019s papers on the 100,000 COVID fatality threshold are playing hard on BJs sympathy for the nation and trying to gloss over his rejection of responsibility for his governments slow and highly reactive management strategy.  Cracks are forming, but the majority seem to be sticking to the \"party line\" for today [3]. -The likelihood that the Tory party will ideally want to keep him in place until 2022/23 for scapegoating purposes and as a setup for their next candidate in 2024 (a situation that may change in coming months dependant on pressure from wealthy Tory donors and further indications of the collapse of the pound, the union etc.) -BJs capacity for delusion, narcissistic optimism and prideful ambition that may be driving him to believe (as of today, anyway) that he can still spin a recovery from his flagging approval ratings[4] as opposed to resigning (which at this moment he would fear being read as an \"acknowledgement of blame\": not a precedented Johnson character trait). Whilst I stand by my previous analysis as a viable premise, BJ's pride and delusional optimism has a capacity to blind him to the machinations of his party and curate his self-assessment of his prospects to focus on his \u201cGreat British Recovery\u201d* to a degree I believe I'd originally under-accounted for. I\u2019ve also adjusted for question time left vs likely timescale for conditions to set themselves up for a \u201creputationaly gentle\u201d departure option to open up for him should he wish to take it (now looking more likely to be at the end of 21 than September). To be adjusted back to where I had it previously depending on fallout from yesterday's COVID fatality announcement and other indicators and conditionals in the next few days & weeks (build up to Scottish elections will be interesting - chuck Boris to win back Scottish Tories?).  Removal / departure before the next election seems highly likely: its a question of whether it\u2019ll happen in the space of the next 8 months. My view remains that, if BJ is to resign (adjusted to a 34% probability) he\u2019ll be looking for a good news story to sail out on (vaccine programme success being the most immediate option).  If it looks like he wants to cling on after this good news \u201coff ramp\u201d then removal from power by his own party in \u201822 or \u201823 becomes more likely. Vaccine programme success / failure and messaging around it remains a key indicator to watch for his question.  How long the 100k threshold stays in the news will be another and any indication of pressure build up (in his own party) behind calls for resignation will be cause for an immediate probability check.

Report in the Daily Mail (a very Tory supportive UK tabloid) of Priti Patel essentially blaming BJ for going against her advice and not closing the UK's borders at the earliest stage of the pandemic:\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9167397/Priti-Patel-claims-wanted-close-UK-borders-MARCH.html 2.  The very public and widely reported \"plan\" to encourage UK population to take a COVID test and self-isolate with a \u00a3500 incentive for all positive test cases (as recommended by medical professionals (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.20191957v1.full.pdf) and trade unions (https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/tuc-more-4-10-workers-would-be-plunged-financial-hardship-if-forced-self-isolate) for some time). This \"leak\" from Hancock's health department (blamed on \"junior officials\") clearly blindsided the government who failed to contain the surprised but generally positive headlines (in both right and left leaning media outlets) and forced BJ (and to a much quieter extent Sunak) into being the \"fiscal grinches\" by shooting the plan down within 24 hours of its publication (and presumably before it gained much more public support). https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55762470\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/covid-payment-500-boris-johnson-b1791226.html Both these extraordinary and hitherto unseen splits in cabinet cohesion are new developments and potential insights into the political manoeuvring going on behind the scenes.  These embarrassing \"leaks\" from within BJ's (loyalty vetted) cabinet are even more surprising given that these two events took place in the shadow of a \"cabinet spring clean\" (either imminent: https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1381632/boris-johnson-cabinet-reshuffle-latest-sack-priti-patel-dominic-raab-gavin-williamson or delayed: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/01/02/boris-johnsons-cabinet-reshuffle-could-delayed-november/).  This could indicate a newly discovered boldness within elements of the Johnson cabinet to openly throw their boss under his big red bus to secure their own political futures.  Such disloyalty and self-preservative action in the face of BJ's recent stamp down on Steve Baker, and despite the obvious threat of being sacked during a future reshuffle, may indicate more of Johnson's blood in the water (and bigger sharks circling him) than previously thought. 3.  The third development relevant to this forecast is the first real and substantial rebellion against the government by the Tory majority during the vote on the \"genocide amendment\" to the UK trade bill (Tuesday 19th Jan 21).  https://www.ft.com/content/eed1eb3b-3d0e-4f22-9908-ca86b11d71d1. This rebellion seems to be a firm stance on the government's (BJs) approach to post Brexit trade deals by both hard line hawks and humanist Tories.  It may also be an \"under the hood\" warning to BJ on the way the wind is blowing. Such rebellions are rarely carried out without significant planning, awareness and \"implication assessment\" from within the 1922 committee and party whips.  Whilst the Government won the vote (successfully removing the obvious moral and ethical checks and balances within this bill incidentally) it was the first real nail bitter for Johnson since winning his super majority: leaving him with just 11 from his previous 78! Barely reported in most media outlets, which goes to show just how (deliberately) difficult it can be to see the fragile glass BJ appears to be standing on.  Be in no doubt however: he knows.

Lost 2005 General Election.\n- Iain Duncan Smith: resigned just over 2 years after becoming leader. Lost vote of confidence. \n- William Hague: resigned 4 years after becoming leader. Lost 2001 General Election. \n- John Major: resigned after almost 7 years as PM after losing 1997 General Election\n- Margaret Thatcher: resigned after 11 years as PM after coming close to losing leadership election Only one Conservative leader of the last six has been ousted after less than 4 years without an intervening election. Boris Johnson won a comfortable majority at the 2019 General Election and his approval ratings have hovered between 35-45% approval since summer 2020, mirroring the Conservative Party's vote at the last election. https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating. While a change in leadership cannot be discounted before the next General Election in 2024, I anticipate no challenge will arise before September 2021. The most likely reason for Johnson's departure is perhaps health-related, although media appearances and reports from insiders suggest he has recovered well from his bad dose of Covid-19 in April 2020. \n"], [754, "2021-01-18T03:45:51Z", [0.05], ""], [86554, "2021-01-17T20:41:25Z", [0.39], ""], [85449, "2021-01-17T20:38:44Z", [0.33], ""], [97976, "2021-01-17T19:30:25Z", [0.18], ""], [1333, "2021-01-17T15:09:49Z", [0.45], ""], [98001, "2021-01-17T12:30:48Z", [0.32], ""], [28899, "2021-01-17T09:36:42Z", [0.03], ""], [85747, "2021-01-17T01:58:12Z", [0.25], ""], [97992, "2021-01-17T00:36:46Z", [0.6], ""], [38094, "2021-01-16T16:36:14Z", [0.05], "BoJo is like a game of pin ball, always bouncing off the rails.

The libertarian wing of the Tory Party (which BJ has himself been a vocal member of previously) rails against \"the constraints on freedoms\" required (by common sense) in the midst of a global pandemic claiming 1000+ lives in the UK per day (as of 15th Jan 21, total now stands at 86, 015 - the highest in Europe: https://covid19.who.int/?gclid=CjwKCAiAl4WABhAJEiwATUnEF3Ip9OWzPU-0gjTYzAwRMAl6IBBMj50AAdzrjhfeKFN3usYNyl9kBxoCqWIQAvD_BwE). At the same time any lifting of COVID control measures gives the virus free licence to run rampant in an already crippled UK health system: a brutal reality which even Boris' pride fuelled optimism has reluctantly had to give ground to.  As such there are no easy mechanisms for him to satisfy the singularly focused voices of the Steve Bakers in the Tory Party by lifting / easing COVID restrictions without a death toll and health system collapse that could feasibly topple his Government and (further) stain his legacy forever. \"Kobayashi Maru\". HOWEVER:  The rapid (within 2 hours) U turn of Steve Baker's \"very British coup (ish)\" is evidence of the grip and control BJ currently retains over his party.  I read it as both an indication of BJ's consciousness as to the fragility of his position AND an indication of the current level of support and control he commands at this moment.  Had Steve Baker had sufficient OVERT support for his letter Boris would not have been as confident in demanding this humiliating climb down from Baker in penance. This is an authoritarian message from Boris to all similarly minded Tory Party MPs: designed to show strength, tenacity and an iron fist in the face of rebellion.  It also shows (contrary to my previous assumptions) that he still wants to retain power (for now) and / or wants to leave on his own terms rather than be ousted (as he did to his two predecessors).  A quick study of history's authoritarian and tyrannical regimes (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2011/2/22/the-arab-awakening) tells us that this form of aggressive reaction by a governing regime is a sign of inner weakness and, often, heralds the beginning of the end.  But it may also indicate that the end is a way off yet. As such, a departure by September seems (at this moment) to be in the balance (50/50).  But with the UK government's track record of reactive mismanagement to current (future?) crises, humiliating policy U Turns, growing support and confidence in Kier Starmer (if not yet in Labour as a whole), a \"pseudo Indy referendum\" on the strength of the union in the Scottish Elections (May 21) and little hope for the UK public to look forward to in the near term (at least until Q3/4 2021) BJ's situation feels incredibly fragile.

I'll bump that down to 0.5% because I can't be bothered to look up the tables myself. What am I, a library? He'll have better medical care than most, which may take down his chance of death, but there's always the chance someone will Spencer Perceval him, so I'm sticking with 0.5% With regard to his removal from the Conservative Party, many MPs are frustrated with his approach to the Coronavirus, but these concerns will abate once the UK's vaccination campaign continues to show its benefits. Even the opposition has been slow to criticise the broad points of government coronavirus policy, and public approval of lockdowns is high. Considering the poor coronavirus response, the Conservative Party is doing well in the polls, so Tory MPs will not be wary in this regard. The Coronavirus will continue to be the main issue in the news until September, so short of another major national emergency, I can't see the polls changing so drastically that Johnson is ousted. What's more, Johnson's ousting will plunge the party back into anarchy, as there is no obvious successor, nor even any clear candidates. In short, no group within the Party will be pushing for Johnson's resignation. Therefore, I put the chance of Johnson being ousted at about 0.5% The Conservatives have nothing to gain and everything to lose by calling a general election, so they will not do so, certainly not before September, when holding elections will still be logistically difficult given the after-effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, I put the chance of Johnson losing a general election as less than 0.1%. Johnson might resign. He is not known for giving up the limelight voluntarily, however, and he does not have an anointed successor in place, as resigning PMs often do. I think the only plausible reason he would resign is for health reasons. There have been rumours that he is suffering from long Covid, which is possible. There is always the outside chance that he is diagnosed with some other disease which forces him to retire as well. Nonetheless, Johnson has shown no indication that he wants to resign, and his job will only get easier as the pandemic fades. Further, it will be logistically difficult, even if Johnson does want to resign, for the Conservatives to run a proper leadership election, so unless Boris is literally incapable of working, I expect he will stay on as a lame duck.

This Ipsos MORI survey (18th December 20) made interesting reading in possible answer to that question: https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/rishi-sunaks-job-satisfaction-ratings-remain-strong-even-labour-supporters"], [1639, "2021-01-03T20:04:36Z", [0.59], "I am not listing here all the Brexit potential problems that may be looming at the UK horizon; COVID, the fine print of the Trade deal with the EU that BoJo may have conveniently \"flu over,\" ... how is the agreement on the Financial Services? which are so important to the city of London where most were against Brexit.

Rationale below, please feel free to challenge and counter-argue. ---------- Many seem to be basing their forecasts of BJ's continuing premiership in 9 months time on today's headlines. I think this is a mistake: they should be looking at the conditions that are GOING to be in place over the next 6 - 9 months time and focusing their view of BJ's fate in that future space. Here are the conditions (forecasted as I see them) that will manifest over the next 9 months: -Red tape and delays at UK trade points will start to manifest as stockpiles run dry, HMRCs \"light touch\" approach runs out and issues with new systems persist\n-Louder criticisms of BJs deal will be heard from industry and trade groups (already heard from fishing groups but currently shouted down in the \"get it done\" euphoria) as benefits of the deal fail to materialise\n-EU will play hard ball with UK negotiators on services provisions (notably absent from BJ's deal and 80% of the UK economic trade value: much more a priority for the UK than the EU) causing voices in the services industry, financial sector and London to be increasingly raised in anger at the lack of progress and opportunity since the Christmas Eve trade deal\n-The UK will likely enter a nasty recession: a combination of COVID impacts and Brexit (although likely spun hard to blaming COVID by the UK gov and supportive media outlets)\n-UK vaccine roll out programme will be delayed, resulting in further economic and societal impacts and increased criticism of UK Gov's handling of COVID 19\n-UK COVID 19 deaths will pass 100,000 early in 2021: a horrendous benchmark that will draw likely comparisons between BJ and Trumps mismanagement of COVID 19 in the US\n-People will start directly feeling the effects of Brexit (trade, travel, holidays, weakened pound increasing costs etc.) and will find them harder and harder to ignore / accept now that the finite game of \"getting Brexit done\" has played itself out\n-Scottish Parliamentary Elections taking place 6th May 2021 currently promise a drumming for the Tories as a non-official referendum on independence from the UK and a repudiation of BJ's Brexit (certain to be used by the SNP as a lever for increased support to another independence referendum - https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9103629/Nicola-Sturgeon-urges-EU-light-says-Scotland-soon.html). Irrespective of whether a referendum takes place or not BJ will be labelled as the harbinger of Scottish independence and the break up of the Union. I've worked hard to not allow pessimism to infect this analysis overmuch: these all seem credible features of the newly minted 2021 (whether we like to admit them or not). Now, its important to also see this through BJs eyes (not our own). BJ will KNOW that much of this is coming. He'll have the inside leg on future projections from Government briefings and will know what the future holds for him. So will his close ministers and senior Tory party members. BJ is (thankfully from a forecasting perspective) a predictably selfish and self-oriented character. When looking at the incoming scenarios of 2021 (and what he likely knows about them) its easy to build an argument for why he might want to resign or otherwise depart under a carefully curated justification (\"Long COVID health concerns\" is my bet) rather than stay. Then, look at what may be in play to make him want to stay in power: -Money?  There are reports he's been privately complaining that the PM job doesn't pay as much as his previous roles as journalist, columnist and after dinner speaker (https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-miserable-upset-cant-afford-nanny-salary-654102). -His legacy? The longer he stays the more tarnished his legacy becomes. BJ will be looking (as he has in previous roles) to tap out at the moment of his popular zenith and before the implications of his actions become a harder to spin reality. This moment is potentially coming up with the beginning of the vaccine roll out programme Q1/2 2021. Everything after that moment seems to be downhill, so I believe the legacy argument actually strengthens the reasoning for his departure before Q3 2021 rather than refutes it. -His agenda? BJ is a what we call a \"finite game player\" (see James P Carse: Finite and Infinite Games). He's a chequers man rather than a chess master. His historical behaviour indicates a strong preference for short term goals and quick win soundbites (not long vision and strategy). His agenda was to take power and become PM (see his \"two sides\" telegraph articles for and against Brexit as an example of his cynical approach to this goal via championing Brexit: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/16/secret-boris-johnson-column-favoured-uk-remaining-in-eu). In terms of his own agenda: he's achieved that now, and the longer he stays the more of a poison pill that role becomes (for him personally). In terms of the Tory Party, the more BJ and his cabinet bungle the management of this complex, congested, cluttered, contested, connected (disconnected?) and constrained post EU environment the UK finds itself in the more BJ is a threat to their agenda (of staying in power) by elevating the competence of Kier Starmer over \"their man in No.10\". The longer they leave it, the more bungles are possible (likely?) and the more reputational damage needs to be repaired before May 2024's general election. I also think its a mistake to limit the view of \"ejection scenarios\" to a pre 2024 general election. This is certainly phenomenally unlikely given the Tory majority in parliament and no good reason (currently) to put their control on the line. Likewise, BJs ejection in a very public vote of no confidence is (currently) unlikely - the Tories carry out their leadership assassinations behind closed doors and out of the line of sight of the public (see Theresa May's demise: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/05/16/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-set-showdown-meeting-senior-tories/) to maintain an outward perception of unity. I would offer that, from the Tory Party's perspective, BJ has now served his purpose. He has delivered them four years in government and rid them of the (internally and externally) divisive issue of Brexit. What more use do they have for him that would make them content to tolerate his continued incompetence? From the cannibalistic Tory party's viewpoint BJ will now be a useful scapegoat to blame for any painful realities Brexit visits on the UK in 2021 and any growth in furore over continued COVID mismanagement. The closer they cut this \"scapegoating\" to an election year the more it's taint on the wider party will be present in the minds and memories of the UK electorate come May 2024. As such I believe the Tory Party will be planning for a \"BJexit\" between Q3 2022 and Q1 2023 leaving enough time to choose a suitable future candidate and curate his (her?) fresh face for the UK electorate before 2024's election. We should also remember that BJ has been playing this game for some time and is himself an opportunist and a political animal. We can safely assume he probably knows how fragile his position is and what may come next from within his party. He'll start hearing the knives being sharpened more and more loudly as the populist noise of Brexit subsides and reality bites. This also supports an argument for his voluntary departure at a \"legacy friendly\" moment: he'll want to jump (with a reputational parachute fitted) before his own party push him off Dover's white cliffs with all the incoming travails the UK faces tied to his ankles. As of right now BJ leaving office would be defined (not  unfairly but also not entirely correctly) as an unexpected \"Black Swan\" event. But Black Swans are only a surprise to those who don't know what conditions to look for that pre-empt their manifestation. BJ and the Tory party will never openly (and honestly) telegraph their intentions on this matter or this questions forecasted outcome, so relying on press releases and \"the mood of the moment\" are unreliable forecasting indicators at best. Conditions, however, don't lie (although they can be lied about)."], [1333, "2021-01-01T14:34:54Z", [0.4], ""], [88928, "2021-01-01T09:52:24Z", [0.05], ""], [91561, "2021-01-01T05:50:16Z", [0.11], ""], [754, "2021-01-01T00:30:48Z", [0.02], ""], [97603, "2020-12-31T21:55:26Z", [0.1], "Highly unlikely following success in getting a Brexit deal + rollout (however delayed) of vaccines.

The part of the UK public BJ has and will continue to try and appeal to will be heavily \"informed\" (influenced) by media headlines (none of them are actually going to try and read the deal for themselves!) and its interesting to see how quickly parts of the previously supportive right wing press (tabloid and broadsheet) have turned on him now the deal's been done. With disruption to travel for UK travellers on the horizon (not likely to be felt hard until spring / summer 2021 when a UK COVID Vacc programme opens opportunities for holiday makers) and delays due to red tape at borders (likely to be seen in Q1 and Q2 2021 whilst the new systems settle in) 2021 isn't shaping up as a particularly positive news story for the incumbent UK PM. More importantly, I think the Tory party know it.  Interesting that the last 24 hours of right leaning media headlines are full of Rishi Sunak and his talk of a \"new golden age\": https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13582880/rishi-sunak-hails-brexit-deal-chance-different/\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/12/27/city-london-can-become-attractive-place-world-list-company-brexit/\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9091315/Rishi-Sunak-calms-nerves-impact-Brexit-financial-sector.html Could this be a setting up of a soft landing zone for the new (potential) PM by Tory friendly media as a precursor indicator of the imminent resignation of the incumbent BJ (likely spun as a stepping down for health reasons)? There has been peripheral reporting of BJ's dissatisfaction with the job (https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8750253/Subdued-Boris-Johnson-worries-money-salary-shrunk-150k.html), and 2020 hasn't exactly been kind to him.  BJ will also be more sighted than any of us as to the UK's projections for 2021 and it seems unlikely he'll want to shoulder responsibility for incoming austerity 2.0, further Brexit realities, more winter flooding mismanagement, UK recession etc. His past performance shows him to be generally work shy, lacking in interest on depth and detail (vital in crisis moments like this) and not comfortable in conflict situations which are only likely to continue into 2021. The conditions for his (carefully curated) resignation seem to be falling into place.  If I'm right on this forecast I think he'll be hoping to resign in a flourish once the UK's COVID vaccination programme is in full swing.  He'll l want to try and leave on a high and this seems to be the most promising good news story on his immediate horizon (i.e. before Sept 21).

If BJ holds firm and either blunders into an \"accidental no deal\" or deliberately walks from the table (note, he still hasn't despite the rhetoric) then the reality of no deal will hit the UK in Q1 2021 alongside ongoing COVID restrictions and the Conservative Party will then likely offer the raging British public Boris' head in compensation. Despite the regularly made comparisons, Boris is not Trump.  He doesn't enjoy the rabid, evangelical, unquestioning popularity of his US doppelganger.  The British people are far more cynical and far less tolerant.  Boris won his majority in the UK Parliament on the back of the unpopularity of his opponent (who's gone now) and his promise to \"get Brexit done\".  This promise will survive until \"Brexit gets done\" after which it seems likely Boris' shine will well and truly have run off. If the Economist's question had asked if Boris would have ceased to be the UK's PM by the next general election this forecast would have been in the high 90's.  The only doubt (23%) in this forecast lays in when the Conservative Party will decide he is a liability they can no longer afford to carry and turn on him. The societal impact of no deal Brexit / capitulation to the EU in negotiations and progress with COVID vaccinations will move this forecast up or down against the question's critical date of September 2021."], [27661, "2020-12-11T17:30:24Z", [0.15], ""], [88766, "2020-12-11T17:13:51Z", [0.38], ""], [38094, "2020-12-11T17:09:47Z", [0.5], "Lets see, just what has BoJo delivered to the British people?\nAn outstanding Covid campaign?

Outside view: of the last 10 PMs (not including Johnson), only one served less than 2.16y [1]: Alec Douglas-Home, at 0.99y. This suggests a base rate of 10% for this question. However, Douglas-Home is also the least recent of the 10 (1963); and Johnson has served ~1.33y already, so really we want the odds of a PM serving <2.16y *given that* they have served >1.33y. And in the sample of 10, these odds are 0%. So maybe we shade that 10% down a little, to 8% say. If we look at PMs after WW2 (a natural breakpoint I think) we get 13 PMs, and 1 that served >1.33y but less than 2.16y. That gives an alternative base rate of 1/13 ~ 7.7%, reassuringly close to 8%, so let's go with 8%. There's also the chance that Johnson dies. Actuarial death tables put the chances of a 56yo man over ~10 months at ~0.7%. There is of course the coronavirus going around, but Johnson has already had it; and when he had it, we saw that he has better medical care available to him than the average person. So I'm comfortable keeping his chance of dying at ~1%, making for a base rate of 9%. INTERNAL POLITICS\nNow for the inside view. Johnson is leader of the Conservative Party, which holds a straight majority in the Commons by a margin of 38, and that's not even counting allied parties such as the DUP. The next elections are scheduled for 2024. So it seems very unlikely he will be forced out. That leaves the option that he steps down voluntarily. The two big reasons I see for stepping down are the coronavirus, and Brexit. CORONAVIRUS\nThe coronavirus seems to have had a real impact on Johnson's popularity [2]. At the beginning of 2020 Johnson's net approval (positive minus negative) was roughly in the interval [-5%,5%], which I gather is normal in the UK. Then there was a big positive jump (to about +20%) in late March that lasted through May. Then public opinion roughly returned to the status quo around -6% through early September. And then there was a big negative dip and sits around -20% now. How does this correlate with covid? Roughly speaking, in the positive period the UK had a big rise in daily covid cases and deaths. The status quo period saw daily cases stabilize at low values, and daily deaths plummet. Then the negative period was when daily cases and deaths rose massively. It's a bit weird that Johnson's approval went up as covid got worse in Mar-Apr, and even weirder that it didn't skyrocket in Jun-Aug when the UK got covid temporarily under control. Maybe the approval correlates with lockdown in a more understandable way? The following is all from [3]. They had serious lockdown from late March through mid-May. In June the restrictions were eased significantly, with some shops and schools reopening. In July and August things reopened further. But in mid-Sep gatherings of 6+ people were made illegal due to the rise in cases, and since then restrictions have increased. I don't get it. But, it seems reasonable that if covid continues to get worse, Johnson will be in real trouble. What's going to happen there? There are the vaccines, which may start deployment as soon as 7 Dec 2020 [4]. They're over 90% effective in trials, so let's roughly say there's an 80% chance they majorly helps with covid; 10% chance they help some but not as much as 90+% would suggest; and 10% chance they flop. In the first case I can't see Johnson stepping down by September for covid reasons. In the second case it seems like low odds, let's say 20% chance given that vaccines help mildly (so 2% total). In the third case I want to say 70% chance he steps down (so 7% total). When will we know which case happened? That will depend on speed of vaccine rollout. But even at 100k/day (I heard 1M/day was the goal at peak) we will have ~5M vaccinated by end of Feb 2021 (recall that it's 2 doses). This is going to be more than enough data for us to find out how the vaccines are doing. By the end of May 2021, assuming 500k/day, we'll have another 23M vaccinated. So by late June we'll definitely know. That leaves plenty of time for Johnson to step down by Sep 2021 if we end up in the bad case. So add 2%+7% to the base rate since the average PM does not deal with a pandemic, bringing us to 18% total. BREXIT\nI've not kept up with the details of Brexit talks in almost 2 years but glancing at [5] it seems the issues are much more concrete now than in say 2018. I think that makes them more likely to be resolved. But I don't think this will be the deciding factor in whether Brexit helps or hinders Johnson staying as PM. In theory the end of the transition period is 31 Dec 2020. In practice the coronavirus gives the best excuse imaginable for them to postpone the deadline. Covid will NOT be solved this year, and if no trade deal is hammered out, neither side will want to sow additional chaos by reverting to WTO rules. Further, any such extension will very likely be longer than 9 months, since it's clear covid won't be completely done by mid-2021 either. In my mind, either covid doesn't improve --- and while that's happening, the breakup is extremely unlikely --- or covid does improve, and that allows Johnson to brag that he solved covid. (Especially since one of the vaccines is British.) I bet he can ride that high past Sep 2021, whatever happens with Brexit. All in all, I don't see a reason for Brexit to shift the 9% base rate either way.

Only 4 prime ministers have served 787 days or fewer (that would take us to 2021-Sep-18), giving him and outside view of 22%  (Bayesian update of an uninformative prior; Beta(5, 17) => E[X] = 5 / (5+17) = 22%, 95% CI: 8% - 42%).

The UK hasn't fared well compared with other countries. Combined with Brexit, this has shaken the country, especially with the regular news about the various govt' failures (PPE, test & trace). Many may forgive him for these, especially on the Conservative side. They may write it off as \"simply bad luck\" and \"outside his control\".

Death - Boris Johnson is a 56 year old male, and by the Actuarial Life Table, there is about a 1% chance he dies in the next year [1]. \n2. Conservative leadership election - These seem to be called after a prime minister resigns but can be called if the party just wants to remove the current leader. [2]  [3] There have been 11 conservative leadership elections since 1965, which is about 1 every 5 years. This is the most likely way Johnson ceases to be prime minister. If the conservative party is sufficiently unhappy with his management of Coronavirus, Brexit, or the many other issues facing Johnson, he could face a challenge within his party. So much is up in the air here. It seems based on the previous leadership elections, they are called if a) the leader lost a general election by a large margin b) the leader has performed poorly in non-electoral fashions or c) the incumbent leader resigns. I doubt a) or c) occur for Boris Johnson, so I'll go a bit under the base rate of 20%. \n3. Loses a general election - Given that next prime minister general election is schedule for 2024 [4] this Johnson should not be removed by a vote of the populace. Unless Johnson calls for some sort of referendum vote like Cameron did (which I can't imagine) he should be safe on this front.

BJ's suggested new law which would break an international treaty is not popular around the world or among older politicians in UK and most likely there is concern within the Tory party around this. The negotiations between EU and UK around a new treaty seem to be treading water and I personally have hard time seeing it get done in the amount of time left. If UK leaves without a deal the consequences of this might be enough to force a resignation. If a deal is struck he might see his mission as done and resign (although I highly doubt this) or the deal might be so obviously \"bad\" for UK he has to resign (low probability for this also).
