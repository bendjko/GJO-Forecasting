Be interesting to see how this pans out. ASSUMPTIONS\na)  These four companies, on average, have their price fluctuate identically to fluctuations in the NASDAQ.\nb)  Current share prices represent the shared wisdom about not just the current value of these companies, but value of these companies in the next few months.  Future share prices are likely to be a random walk from the current price, with an mean result similar to prior movements in the NASDAQ.\nc)  The price movements of these four companies are more likely to be independent than perfectly correlated.**\nd)  The share price of Alphabet fluctuates significantly more wildly than the the share price of the other 3 companies. [** The maths for a scenario other than one of these 2 extremes is beyond me.  So either I commit to saying, \"Apple is in front now, so Apple will always be in front\", or else I assume that the random walk that each company's valuation takes is unrelated to the walk taken by the other companies, constrained only be the general tendency to walk in a way that can be modelled by past NASDAQ movements.  Given the past price movements, I think the latter is closer to the truth than the former ... as the former is demonstrably incorrect.] STEP ONE\nTake data of NASDAQ closing price on a daily basis over the last 10 years. STEP TWO\nGiven today's prices, calculate what % growth each company needs to hit the target.\n*  For Apple, a valuation increase of +6.3% is required.\n*  For Alphabet, a valuation increase of +20.9% is required. STEP THREE\nGiven there are 115 weekdays between now and the resolution point of the question, how often in the last 10 years has the NASDAQ closing price on a given day varied upwards (compared to the closing price 115 market days prior) by more than the percentage required top \"hit the target\"?\n*  For Apple, the NASDAQ has increased in value by +6.3% or more 1449 times out of the last 2404, or 60.3% of the time.\n*  For Alphabet, the NASDAQ has increased in value by +20.9% or more 164 times out of the last 2404, or 6.8% of the time. This simulates the probability that the given company's valuation will exceed 1 terabuck (T$) at close of market on 31 December. STEP FOUR\nIf a company's probability of being valued at T$1+ at the close of the year = (n), then the probability of being valued at at T$1+ at the close of ANY day before then must be significantly greater than (n). This is pure guess work, but let:\np(closing price of T$1- on EVERY day before 1Jan) = [p(closing price of T$1- on 31Dec)]^2 ... but use ^3 for Alphabet because of it's more highly fluctuating price - it is more likely than the others to have gone above target then fallen back below. *  For Apple, failing to hit target on 31Dec 39.7% of the time, means failing to hit target at any point before then 15.8% of the time.  (0.397^2)\n*  For Alphabet, failing to hit target on 31Dec 93.2% of the time, means failing to hit target at any point before then 81.0% of the time.  (0.932^3). STEP FIVE\nAssuming the probabilities of EACH company failing to hit target at any point before 1Jan are independent, the probability of ALL companies failing to hit target can be determined by multiplying the individual probabilities. * This gives a 6.5% chance that NO company will hit target, and a 93.5% chance that AT LEAST ONE company will hit target before 1 January. STEP SIX\nAssuming ANY company hits target, the odds of each company hitting target first is proportional to the probability that that company will hit target at ANY point before the end of year (as determined in STEP FOUR).  Converting those odds back into percentages, we get:\n*  Apple are 53.9% likely to win the race, assuming the race is won.\n*  Alphabet are 12.2% likely to win the race, assuming the race is won. STEP SEVEN\nMultiple the probabilities at STEP SIX by 0.935 (as determined in STEP FIVE) to get the individual companies' chances of hitting target AND beating all the others to the target. **********************************\nUpdating will just requiring punching in the current valuations (per Bloomberg) and the number of market days remaining, and the spreadsheet should do the rest.

Analyst consensus estimates for stock prices a year from now see Apple barely below the necessary stock price threshold of ~$200 at ~195. [1] Amazon is seen even farther behind at ~$1800 compared to a needed threshold around ~$2000. Given that these estimates are for 12 months from now, expected stock prices by end of the year are probably even lower. However, one shouldn't put too much faith in analyst estimates, especially with regard to exact timing. In my experience, they are usually based on company fundamentals rather than factors that can more strongly drive short term volatility such as market psychology. The way I interpret them is as general buy or sell signals. It is quite possible that stocks go in the opposite direction and it is possible that even if stocks rise in line with expectations, they rise faster (or slower) than expected.
