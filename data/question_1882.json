The thesis of this research was: There are increases in repealing activity when (1) the majority party is ideologically unified and (2) the majority came into power after a long stint in the minority. The first statement applies, as Democrats now control the executive, house, and senate.  But the legislation was in place for long enough that either party could have repealed or amended it in some way after re-taking control of any branch of government.  Both parties want it changed (though maybe not for the same reasons), increasing the probability that it happens.

Options for change include: 1. A full repeal, 2. Amending platform\u2019s ability to moderate themselves, 3. Amend the liability shield for platforms, 4. Amend a small, insignificant technical detail for the political win of standing up to big tech. 1. Full repeal - Minute possibility (increases chances 1%)\n\u201cThe complete repeal of Section 230 that Trump screamed for on his now-banned Twitter account isn\u2019t likely \u2014 that would upend the entire internet \u2014 but the kind of reform many Democrats called for is very possible.\u201d\nhttps://www.vox.com/recode/22221135/capitol-riot-section-230-twitter-hawley-democrats\nAlthough Biden called for a \u201cfull repeal\u201d on the campaign trail, that quote was in reference to Facebook abusing its power, and appears to have been made without understanding the full context of the repercussions. Repercussion \u2014 ie \u201cupending the entire internet \u2014  which would create wide anger toward the Democratic party and would be in conflict with the Democrats\u2019 focus on the 2022 midterm (See Democratic priority section at the end). 2. Amend platforms\u2019 ability to moderate themselves - Minute possibility (increases chances 1%)\nThis has been the focus of Republicans who are angry at what they see as the suppression of conservative voices by social media. The election of Biden and flipping of the Senate all but kill the likelihood of this being the focus of a Section 230 amendment. However, the democrats may reach for republican support, seeing as Section 230 has become a stand-in for \u201cbig tech has too much power\u201d. That being said, the \u201cconservative voices\u201d the Republicans are upset at being silenced, are often the same voices the Democrats are made at for spreading \u201chate speech\u201d. Cracking down on hate speech is a focus of Democratic amendments, thus cooperation seems unlikely. Additionally, as seen in the Obama years, recent attempts at bipartisanship have consistently been shut down by Republican leadership. 3. Amend the liability shield for platforms - possible path (increases chances 10%)\n- There is already a framework for this kind of change in the form of 2018 FOSTA, which removed liability coverage in cases of sex trafficking\n- The EARN IT Act (2020) followed the FOSTA framework, focusing on Child pornography as opposed to sex trafficking. However, tech companies and free speech activists have called the act a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d to control wider-ranging speech and encryption.  https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/03/proposed-us-law-is-trojan-horse-to-stop-online-encryption-critics-say/\n- The Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act. This would remove immunity if algorithms continue to push individuals toward extremist content, users, or groups. \n- Recent events at the US capitol make this kind of a change far more politically relevant, and the fact that it will not upend the internet makes it less of a poison pill for the 2022 elections. (See Democratic strategy section for why this does not increase chances more) 4. Amend a small, insignificant technical detail for the political win of standing up to big tech (increases likelihood by 1%)\n- This would be a short term victory only, once the next big story of a big tech abuse or a hate crime organized on social media breaks democrats would be blasted for ineffective governing. If a change were to be made, Democrats will want to be able to show how it made a difference. 5. Will this be enough of a Democratic priority to warrant a spot in Bidens first 7 months?\n-Very unlikely (subtracts 6% chance) \n-As seen above new presidents\u2019 first 7 months average 20 meaningful bills passed into law (I excluded bills naming a building, extending funding, and recognizing individuals).\n- \u201cBiden\u2019s speech last night, laying out a $1.9 trillion economic plan, made that clear. His agenda will remain more tightly linked to the immediate crisis than Obama\u2019s. Although Obama also began his presidency with a huge stimulus bill, he soon pivoted to health care and climate change, which had only tenuous connections to the housing meltdown that led to the recession. Biden shows no sign of pivoting to anything so removed from the coronavirus.\u201d\n- \u201cHe is already planning a second piece of legislation that will include spending on clean-energy and infrastructure programs to put people back to work and tax increases on the wealthy to reduce the deficit.\u201d\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/briefing/biden-stimulus-indonesia-earthquake-impeachment-vote.html\n- Recent rhetoric suggests Biden will base his strategy on achieving wins that are focused on the current problems of the American people and thus are focused on relief and recovery from the Covid pandemic and economic crisis \n- I accept that individual members of congress could organize an amendment to the law, and Biden has clearly signaled that he is interested in an amendment. But the political capital necessary to overcome big tech\u2019s expected lobbying and the fear of such an amendment upending the internet \u2014 subsequently turning off voters \u2014 strikes me as obstacles that will not be overcome without a plan from the top of the Democratic Party\n"], [691, "2021-01-16T17:55:28Z", [0.12], ""], [94872, "2021-01-16T02:13:29Z", [0.23], ""], [96791, "2021-01-15T17:18:53Z", [0.01], "Despite Biden proposing revoking this law and generally not being a fan of it, I project that the Biden Administration and US Congressional delegates will prioritize other domestic agendas ahead of this item, largely in part to the COVID-19 recovery. https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation "], [97947, "2021-01-15T16:22:21Z", [0.03], "I don't see this happening in a Democrat-led congress."], [88452, "2021-01-15T10:51:49Z", [0.51], ""], [94737, "2021-01-15T06:06:50Z", [1.0], ""], [96831, "2021-01-15T04:25:26Z", [0.65], "After last week's chaos at the Capitol and the resulting fallout on social media, if repeal doesn't happen, there are likely to be some changes.
