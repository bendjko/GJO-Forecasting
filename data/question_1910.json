However, that risk is tempered by the current presidential administration's desire to reduce US military involvement overseas and by the relatively close time horizon of the question."], [59141, "2021-09-12T01:17:12Z", [0.0], "Time is running out"], [95683, "2021-09-11T22:39:35Z", [0.0], ""], [62808, "2021-09-11T19:28:25Z", [0.02], ""], [87827, "2021-09-11T01:14:26Z", [0.02], ""], [3429, "2021-09-10T18:02:02Z", [0.02], "maintaining current forecast"], [102528, "2021-09-10T03:25:13Z", [0.05], ""], [42234, "2021-09-09T21:31:53Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2021-09-09T06:33:00Z", [0.15], ""], [1333, "2021-09-09T06:31:09Z", [0.14], ""], [99780, "2021-09-08T19:33:43Z", [0.02], ""], [95683, "2021-09-02T20:36:48Z", [0.0], ""], [1333, "2021-09-02T10:59:58Z", [0.13], ""], [2965, "2021-08-31T00:26:52Z", [0.0], ""], [3429, "2021-08-30T18:48:43Z", [0.02], "maintaining forecast"], [1333, "2021-08-30T12:12:19Z", [0.12], ""], [79142, "2021-08-24T19:19:12Z", [0.04], ""], [3429, "2021-08-23T16:29:26Z", [0.02], "Maintaining current forecast.

Warning shots fired (in night time conditions), Iranian speed boats conducting \"swarming\" harassment activity.  Reportedly the first time such activity has taken place in over a year. Whilst the images are powerful this seems to be muscle flexing from the Iranian side more than anything else (likely as the \"opening salvo\" of hand strengthening \nfor negotiations with the US on resumption of the Nuclear deal and as a show of strength for their own people at a time of manifest fragility), but in a tinderbox environment it wouldn't take more than a single wild card Captain (on either side arguably) to set the spark and see this escalate into a (likely small scale) lethal engagement: a skiff being sunk in a collision or a warning shot becoming more than just a warning in the darkness and fog of war. Upping the forecast due to escalating proximity and frequency of action and the apparent willingness of the Iranian side to show their teeth to the new US administration rather than build bridges.  Disappointing, counter-productive but not entirely unexpected. WILL appears to be in place on both sides to challenge each others positions through military posturing (although not, at a policy level, anything more kinetic than that at this stage).\nCAPABILITY is clearly in place on both sides to cause some form of lethal harm.\nOPPORTUNITY appears to be increasing with the escalation in movements, forces and \"near miss\" engagements of this sort. Still feels like it remains far more likely that, if it happens, the Iranians will \"go live\" through more asymmetric means (and outside Iran's national military and territory) or against civil shipping and private maritime security during some form of trade embargo operation (with estimates on how long Iran could realistically \"close\" the straits of Hormuz ranging from a few days to 100 days [3]) . So, the most credible routes to lethal engagement between national forces of the US and Iran still seems far more likely to be a miscalculation, misinterpretation or a moment of chaotic \"rule of engagement\" interpretation. Despite the hot rhetoric lethal engagements between US and Iranian forces are, based on a historical baseline, incredibly rare (with the last \"shots fired\" between US and Iranian military forces being the Trump administration's Drone Strike on Qasem Soleimani on 3 Jan 2020 [4], and even that would have fallen out of scope for this question given that it took place within Iraq's borders). With malign actors (both in the US homeland and abroad) looking at a military confrontation between the US and Iran as an agenda opportunity however...Will drop back down to crowd base rate if things cool off and this recent activity proves to be a \"spat\".

However, the Trump administration has also imposed many punitive tariffs on Iran for their human rights abuses and state-sponsoring of terrorism, but Biden has not signified whether or not he plans to lift these sanctions [1].

As to how it will be treated, and the politics behind I'm not sure it means escalation or that we will receive good information. We assume the US is involved for truly democratic reasons (not sure personally) so perhaps trying to assess all motivations then reverse engineer.

Biden has made it clear that his focus will be Covid, correcting the 'ills' of the previous administration, climate change policies and rejoining the Paris Club and JCPOA. Looking at Biden's history in office, it is unlikely he will seek confrontation directly or indirectly with Iran. It will, however, be interesting to see how Biden's foreign policy in MENA will either develop or stall the apparent smoothing of relations in the area achieved by the previous administration. More importantly, regarding Saudi Arabia's apparent desire to use the new relations with Israel and other GCC states, including Qutar, to control Iran.  From the Iranian perspective, any conflict with USA in Iranian airspace or territory would have to be a serious challenge to the country's sovereignty for them to react militarily as it is unlikely the Iranians have the firepower to survive, Even with support from Russia.

In terms of foreign policy priorities, the administration will want to focus on China, combating Russian malign influence in Europe, and managing the Southwestern Border of the U.S. and the sources of migrant flows from Central America.  The last thing they want is to start any sort of conflict in the Middle East.   That said, so-called \"normal accidents\" are real and escalations to lethal violence through mutual mis-perception or misunderstanding are common in the history of international politics.

Additionally, it is unlikely that Iran will directly confront the United States militarily because that type of action will not allow them to accomplish their goals of having sanctions reduced/lifted [1]. Further, the Biden administration has stated that they intend to rejoin the JCPOA [2]. While that may not be feasible, due to the actions taken by the previous administration, it does show that the Biden administration is more interested in lowering tensions than increasing them. Further, the last conflict at sea that almost led to fatalities between Iran and the United States occurred in 2016 when 10 US sailors were captured. Iran did not execute any of those individuals as they, most likely, made the strategic decision that killing US military members would not further their ability to achieve their strategic goals [3]. Also, the last time Iran engaged US military aircraft was in 2019 when they shot down an unmanned drone [4]. The US has also engaged Iranian-backed Shia militants in Iraq, but since those actions occurred outside of Iran, their territorial waters/airspace, and not in international airspace over the sea (nor are those proxies Iranian military/LE) the engagements fall outside of the scope of this question [4]. Finally, President Biden's first year in office will, most likely, focus on domestic issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment, and economic assistance to Americans who need it. If they make foreign policy a priority they will most likely focus on strengthening ties with European/NATO allies and rebuilding relationships with allies in the Asia-Pacific. A nuclear Iran is not something most Americans are currently concerned about so it would seem unlikely that the Biden Administration would put themselves in a situation that could lead to a lethal confrontation with Iran. Thus, I rate the probability of a lethal confrontation between the US and Iran before 1 Jan 2022 at a 0% probability.

This shows Iran is still keen to maintain an outwardly aggressive posture, and such things can easily escalate for numerous local and hard to control reasons (e.g. feisty low level military commanders with a Soleimani grudge). However, such past piracy actions have rarely spilt blood (the lethal part of this question): they are generally engineered as headline and hostage / leverage grabbers and to open talks rather than shut them down.  Any lethal action in ship seizures is also more likely to involve ship-borne private security than US national forces unless things get way out of control. Biden is very unlikely to continue Drumpf\u2019s (https://twitter.com/RealDonalDrumpf?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) drone assassination / engineered provocation programmes against Iranian leadership, although local / regional actors may attempt to stir the pot to drag the US into an engagement against their will (and to Iran\u2019s ultimate disadvantage).  Rocket attacks against US military bases in neighbouring countries remains possible but such things have historically been part of a deliberate response to provocation (less likely now the Troll in Chief is out of the White House) and would not resolve the question anyway given the notable absence of US military bases \"in Iran\"! It\u2019s also worth noting that Israel (who have done well out of the Trump administration) will likely not want to loose the initiative following the the change over of US leadership and will be driving for more stringent controls.  Hard line elements may seek to induce something violent / lethal / spectacular to force Biden\u2019s hand in maintaining a hard line with Iran peace overtures.  Israels response to the Biden administration over the next year is one to watch (good summation of Biden / Israel relationship here: https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/views-on-israel-of-u-s-presidential-candidates-2020-joe-biden). TLDR: there are various routes to flashpoint lethal engagements within this questions geographical and physical bounds (maritime escalation, inducement and provocation by local regional actors, targeted (and likely limited) response to rocket attacks on regional US assets) that mean this cannot be called a 0% event.  But its also fair to say this is not in the strategic interests of either protagonist\u2019s leadership at this moment, making the most likely routes to lethal engagement accidental or induced by external players and external interests (which usually come with some preemptive tells and flags to adjust forecasts from).
