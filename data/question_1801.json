The nation is scaling back food subsidies and will gradually raise gasoline prices to save dwindling foreign reserves, the caretaker finance minister said.  Few things energize a citizenry in the Middle East more than a cutback on subsidies.  It will be important to watch this over the next few weeks to see if it causes any major changes to the structure of the government.  But for now, I'm adjusting the likelihood nothing gets down by 1 April. The central bank has $16 billion left in foreign reserves, of which only $1 billion to $1.5 billion can be used to fund subsidies, enough for two to three months, Ghazi Wazni said in an interview. Reserves have halved from about $30 billion a year ago. \u201cLebanon can no longer continue with the same pace of subsidies,\u201d Wazni said, without giving a time frame for the changes. \u201cIt costs $500 million a month, $6 billion a year. That\u2019s why the government made the decision to rationalize subsidies and reduce them on some items.\u201d The pound plummeted below 13,000 per dollar on the black market Monday, shedding more than 20% in two weeks. Since anti-government protests erupted in October 2019, the currency has lost nearly 90% of its value, pushing millions into poverty. The inflation rate was 84% last year, with food inflation hitting an annual 402% in December. And quite possibly the MOST important issue: the caretaker cabinet cannot negotiate with the IMF, now essential to unlocking other aid. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/lebanon-to-reduce-subsidies-as-cash-runs-out-finance-chief-says"], [34959, "2021-03-16T15:13:57Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [691, "2021-03-15T17:17:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [98274, "2021-03-15T15:36:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [97459, "2021-03-15T01:36:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.96], ""], [98258, "2021-03-14T23:55:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [1333, "2021-03-14T14:30:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [94889, "2021-03-13T14:31:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2021-03-12T20:18:20Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [95797, "2021-03-11T12:14:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [691, "2021-03-10T16:40:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [1333, "2021-03-10T14:40:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [97945, "2021-03-10T11:21:17Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [97459, "2021-03-10T03:13:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.91], ""], [97593, "2021-03-09T22:45:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [73050, "2021-03-09T21:10:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [96991, "2021-03-09T17:30:26Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [98251, "2021-03-09T16:58:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [34959, "2021-03-09T14:25:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.03, 0.97], ""], [88452, "2021-03-09T14:18:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [94872, "2021-03-08T04:27:27Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.98], ""], [97561, "2021-03-08T01:02:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [85097, "2021-03-07T21:11:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.99], ""], [97591, "2021-03-07T20:38:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.95], ""], [22689, "2021-03-07T17:09:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [97459, "2021-03-07T16:41:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.14, 0.86], "Decrementing due time remaining despite the fact this article talks about the current caretaker prime minister threatening to resign in order to pressure the sides to come to an agreement.

According to Brittanica.com: The head of state is the president, who is elected by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly for a term of six years and is eligible to serve consecutive terms. By an unwritten convention, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the premier a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of the National Assembly a Shi\u02bfi Muslim. The president, in consultation with the speaker of the National Assembly and the parliamentary deputies, invites a Sunni Muslim to form a cabinet, and the cabinet members\u2019 portfolios are organized to reflect the sectarian balance. The cabinet, which holds more executive power than the president, requires a vote of confidence from the Assembly in order to remain in power. A vote of no confidence, however, is rarely exercised in practice. A cabinet usually falls because of internal dissension, societal strife, or pressure exerted by foreign states. Now it is time to do some research on votes of confidence in Lebanon. - A quick Google Search is returning links with a vote of confidence last occurred in February, 2020.  That is when the Prime Minister in question, Mustafa Diab, received a vote of confidence for his cabinet.  He had been tasked to form a government in December 2019 when the previous prime minister had resigned.  In this case, it took two months from the time a person was chosen until the vote of confidence was taken.  While he has since resigned because of the August bombing, Diab is still acting as the caretaker prime minister.   - In October 2020, Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri was tasked with forming his fourth government, winning a slim majority of votes in parliament just under a year after his resignation amid mass-protests last year.  It is now almost February 2021 and the vote of confidence has not yet taken place to confirm Hariri or his cabinet.  The next question is why has the vote of confidence not taken place?  https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/22/lebanons-saad-hariri-secures-parliamentary-support-to-be-next-pm -It appears that French President Emmanual Macron has been involved trying to get the new government formed.  He has made trips to Lebanon and consults by phone, but no success has been made. - This could take a really long time!  According to the Economist from 2018: LEBANON'S POLITICS operates slowly. It took two and a half years for the country to elect its current president, nine years to hold parliamentary elections and 12 years to pass a budget. The forming of a government appears to obey a similar temporal rule. Lebanon has spent nearly two and a half of the past 13 years without a government, and talks to form a new one have dragged on for over seven months. The country\u2019s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri (pictured), said this month that he was hopeful that a new cabinet could be formed before the end of the year.  Bottom line, I see this taking a long time, at by a long time, I mean more than 3 months.   Given all this, I am at 86% that something will not be formed before 1 April and 14% it will occur before 31 March.   The crowd forecast is at 42% and 58%  Wow, I'm way off the crowd!

In 2009, it took the Prime Minster (PM) eight months to win parliament\u2019s vote of confidence.  Conversely, the previous (PM), appointed in December 2019, took only two months.  The current PM, Saad Hariri, was appointed 22 October 2020.  Simply averaging the two available data points (two months and eight months) would suggest parliament will give a vote of confidence to Hariri\u2019s new government by 31 March 2021. Inside view adjustments.  \nInternal politics: Lebanon\u2019s current political and economic situation appears more challenging than it was in 2019.  Lebanon\u2019s previous government resigned in August 2020 following an explosion at the Beirut Port.  This led the President to appoint Hariai as PM.  Hariri is very unpopular and in fact, resigned as PM in 2017.  He has pledged to form a government of politically elite technocrats, which angered several of the dominate political factions.  Most importantly, Hezbollah and it\u2019s allies strongly oppose Hariai\u2019s approach.  Hezbollah\u2019s support was critical to gaining a quick vote of confidence in 2019.  Absent Hezbollah\u2019s backing, the current process will likely take much longer, as it did in 2009.  This shifts my forecast further from the outside view to eight months (June 2021).  Economic pressure: Many middle east experts argue Lebanon\u2019s current economic and fiscal situation is the worst it has been since the 1975-1990 civil war.  This deteriorating situation has led France and World Bank to take an active interest in Lebanon\u2019s economic stability.  Both have called for political as well as economic reforms as conditions for badly needed financial aid.  Lebabon\u2019s need for external assistance may drive internal compromise, however, involving a third party to internal political issues will undoubtedly add more time to the process of selecting and certifying a government.  Absent additional information, I expect the benefit of external pressure will balance with the delays of external coordination and have a net negligible effect on my eight-month forecast. \n"], [1333, "2021-01-30T14:34:31Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.37, 0.28], ""], [1333, "2021-01-30T14:33:54Z", [0.0, 0.53, 0.37, 0.1], ""], [94872, "2021-01-30T00:26:16Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.64, 0.36], ""], [97945, "2021-01-29T19:29:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.3], ""], [88452, "2021-01-29T04:52:28Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [62808, "2021-01-28T23:46:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4], ""], [691, "2021-01-28T20:47:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.54, 0.46], ""], [97459, "2021-01-28T17:40:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.55, 0.45], "The government formation process is being held up by both personal insults and political disagreements PM designee was insulted by video footage of President calling PMd a liar.
