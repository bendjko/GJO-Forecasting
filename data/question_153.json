This week, a new scandal involving Keiko taking 500 days off for maternity leave, and reminding the people of the over 300,000 indigenous women sterilized by the Fujimori regime may have an effect. So far, Keiko's campaign to hand out a piece of tupperware with her photo and $10 soles (about $1 dollar) inside is having a better effect.  \nPPK is being attacked as the candidate of the gringos and the one that is ready to sell the country to the US. Meanwhile, Keiko continues to campaign saying that \"no le temblaran las manos\" or her hands won't shake in hesitation if it comes down to declaring a state of emergency to deal with crime.  That language is awfully familiar to the strong hands regimes of Latin America that people have flown to in hopes of being \"saved\" by a paternalistic state.   At the same time, PPK asked Keiko at the last debate to tell the Peruvian people where are the US$ 6 billion that her father stole from the government.

He criticised Keiko for missing 500 days of work as a Congresswoman (she answered that she went on maternity leave twice, but that only covers 180 days), asked if she was going to extradit her uncles from Japan, who have ongoing corruption charges in Peru (she said that she was not going to interfere with justice), and wondered why the police had found over 100kg of cocaine in a warehouse owned by Kenji, Keiko's brother (she said that it was normal that drug trafficking infiltrate local businesses!?!?!?!?). He ended the debate on a high note. In Piura, Keiko told him \"How have you changed, pelona\" (in reference to a known poem), because he supported her last elections. In the last debate, PPK answered: \"You haven't changed a little bit, pelona, you are still the same\", in reference to her father's legacy and her role as first lady in his government. Moreover, Veronika Mendoza, the left-wing leader and third on the first round, decided to publicly support PPK for Sunday's election, which could prove as a vital boost in this last week. Lourdes Flores Nano, PPC's leader, has also shown support for PPK, while the party Accion Popular, fourth during the first round, also publicly supported PPK's campaing. This could prove as a last bit impulse to PPK's campaign, which could help revert the gap. No more polls will be published in the media this week. Nonetheless, they are still made and tend to leak in social media. So, I will post the results if I get them. Finally, today is the second Demonstration against Keiko in the Lima centre.

See link below) The first debate between Keiko and PPK just wrapped up tonight and it's expected to help with the undecided voters.

In my estimation, Keiko had the best performance in terms of \"energy\" but she came across as too rehearsed while PPK came across as the candidate with the most comprehensive policies, also the most judicious and trustworthy (from social media reactions).  Something that came up during the debate and that resonated quickly (on social media, at least) was PPL BEING LOW ENERGY AND BEING 77 YEAR OLD.  \nPPK IS ALSO BEING ATTACKED FOR HAVING A US PASSPORT and for allegations that he would sell the country to foreigners. Apparently he made an 8 day trip to the US which he says wast to campaign with expatriots who will be voting overseas but Keiko is using that to feed foreign ties conspiracies.  This first debate was held in the north side of the country, Keiko's strong hold. The second debate will take place on May 29 and will be held in the south.   What else can we look at in such a close election?   Demographics:  \nPeru's population is 31,745,778.  50.1% Males. 49.9% Females. \nLiteracy rate for adult male population is 97.28% (10 717 148 persons). 299,770 are illiterate.\nLiteracy rate for adult female population is 91.7% (10 597 400 persons). 958,693 are illiterate.\nYouth literacy rates are 98.89% and 98.99% for males and females accordingly.  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pe.html\nAmerindians are still 45% of the population.  \nThe south part of the country and rural areas were Umala's stronghold and went to Veronica Mendoza and PPK on the first round.  It's expected to remain the same.  Keiko's popularity is much higher in the coastal areas across the land (both in 2011 and on the 2016 first round).\nI haven't found indication of voter preference along gender or age lines.  Ollanta Umala's popularity at end of his term: \nHis government was tainted by corruption allegations involving his wife (he is exempt from indictment while in office).  He is credited with maintaining the same economic policy and relative economic stability but he has let a lot of people down as his investment in social programs or lifting people out of poverty was not what many expected.  The issue of Alberto Fujimori's corruption case and subsequent 25 year prison sentence and Keiko's ties to her father's government and legacy.  In 2011, Keiko famously said \"vamos a sacar al chino de la carcel\" or \"we are going to get the Chinese man out of prison (referring to her dad).  During this campaign, she has said that there has been no evidence of the crimes her father was accused.  She has also said that she is running separate from her father.  Interestingly, Keiko has made alliances with, it appears, any faction that would have her. She famously made an alliance with independent miners who are said to be wrecking havoc on the environment. Her ties to known drug lords and money launderers have made headlines many times this year. But she has been very successful in  separating herself, as the most able candidate with a strong populist appeal.  She is adept as using soundbytes and simple language that gets to the people.  In 2011, UMALA received 51.45% of the vote and Keiko received 48.55%.  UMALA was a lot more charismatic than PPK is and Keiko has had time to mature and learn more about the process.  FIRST ROUND VOTE:\nKEIKO got 39.74% on the first round, PPK 21.4%  Most of the 18.82% of votes that VERONICA MENDOZA got on the FIRST ROUND are most likely to go to PPK, but a number of these voters may go blank (Peru has a high rate of blank vote and invalid votes, ABOUT 5.7%, \nINVALID VOTES ARE USUALLY VERY HIGH 921,711, IN THE LAST ELECTION. \nSlightly more people voted on the FIRST round vs the SECOND, a 1.4% difference. First round results:\nBARNECHEA got 6.9% of the vote, he has said he will not support KEIKO.  His supporters are presumably most likely to support PPK.\nALAN GARCIA, the former president of Peru, got 5.6% on the first round, his supporters may be split, he has not taken a stand regarding Keiko or PPK but has been very vocal in asking both candidates to stop destroying each other as it is causing the country to be divided in half.\nVERONICA MENDOZA received 18% of the votes, her supporters are leftists, socialists. They will presumably go to PPK but this group is the one expected to have the largest number of blank votes.  Mendoza was on a tour of the south this week to thank them for the overwhelming support. She has asked her supporters to vote against \"Fujimorismo.\" She continues to attack the Fujimori record and many say that she is more forceful than even PPK in doing so.  Going by the performance on the first debate, I will give a slight edge to PPK.

In the USA, pundits and analysts (even credible ones like Nate Silver) predicted for months that Trump would not be the Republican nominee. They told all kinds of stories and had all kinds of logical arguments for this claim. But they ignored or underestimated the importance of the polls, and guess what, the polls were right. Recently I was forecasting (and therefore following) the Philippine election [1]. Early on, there were all kinds of stories and logical arguments on why Rodrigo Duterte would not win the election. He is basically a crazy, confessedly murderous, justice-ignoring, vigilante-supporting, Trump on steroids, who while running made frequent remarks about his use of Viagra, his having three girlfriends, and joked about the rape of an Australian nun. Now, the Philippines are a very Christian country --- e.g. they banned Blizzard's hit game Diablo 3 [2] and almost banned Diablo 2 more than a decade ago. They make it very hard for basic sex ed to be taught and for people to have access to birth control. (I have a friend there who works in this branch of public health and she struggles.) Any story or logical argument you can come up with is going to say that Duterte would NEVER get elected. Christianity is against murder and polygamy and rape of nuns right? Except the polls told a different story, and the polls were right again. I for one was too slow to react to them. Last week Duterte was elected with 39% of the vote. (Not sure why the GJO question is still pending resolution.) All this is to say that investigations of this or that person, this or that government scandal, or even the fact that Fujimori's dad was a murderous dictator --- these are, I think, poor predictors. We need to look at the polls, especially since we are very close to the election. The average of the last 3 polls conducted by Ipsos (Peru's foremost polling organization as far as I can tell) have Fujimori at 43.7% and Kuczynski at 40.9%, with Fujimori ahead in every single one [3,4,5]. This is further strengthened by an Ipsos poll where voters were divided according to educational level [6]: Fujimori has a massive, 10-20% lead among those with less than a college degree, which is almost everyone in Peru. I had trouble finding the percentage of college graduates in Peru, but one source [7] claims Peru currently has 78 universities serving 500k students. Assuming each student stays in college 4 years and generously assuming the current situation stretches back 20 years, we find 2.5M college graduates (probably much less) among a voting-age population of 21M [8] (voting is compulsory in Peru). The average number of years of schooling for a Peruvian adult is just 7.6 years --- less than high school, the level at which Fujimori's support is greatest. In view of all this I am revising my 75% forecast substantially up. Let's generously assume Kuczynski is actually ahead in voting intentions but it's very close, so that on any given poll he has a 50% chance of coming out ahead. What, then, are the odds that Fujimori would come out ahead in 3 polls? Just 12.5%. The odds are even worse if Kuczynski was substantially ahead in voting intentions. So I'm calling a 10% chance that the latest polls don't reflect reality. Thus, Fujimori 90% to win.

[vowing] that no one with the Fujimori surname would seek the presidency in 2021 before her brother declared on Twitter: \"the decision is mine.\" Critics said the dispute has laid bare a rift at the heart of their center-right party, Fuerza Popular, as patriarch Alberto Fujimori languishes in prison for corruption and human rights abuses committed during his 1990-2000 government. \"Fujimori and her brother are fighting about who will get the pi\u00f1ata in 2021!\" Fujimori's rival Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a centrist economist, told reporters. \"Peru is not a pi\u00f1ata.\" Kenji Fujimori, a 35-year-old lawmaker, has defended Alberto Fujimori more stridently than his sister and is widely seen as leading his father's hardline loyalists.

But the damage may have already been done, especially among middle-ground voters wary of the family's dominance, said Alfredo Torres, the director of pollster Ipsos in Peru. \"I think Keiko reacted very well, she put Kenji in his place...but the balance is negative,\" said Torres. \"It's going to be harder for her to win over undecided voters.\" Fujimori and Kuczynski have been virtually tied in recent opinion polls.

I'm leaning more towards the 50-50 side because my assumption that the undecideds split similarly is strong. 68% is 1SD, 95% is 2SD, so let's say 70% chance that F pulls it out in the runoff."], [691, "2016-04-15T19:19:48Z", [0.51], ""], [12302, "2016-04-15T05:28:30Z", [0.1], ""], [12302, "2016-04-15T05:26:56Z", [0.15], ""], [8226, "2016-04-15T05:20:57Z", [0.65], ""], [23879, "2016-04-15T04:49:51Z", [0.75], "First, I googled who won Peru's past elections. Recent history: 1962 -- 1963 dictatorship\n1963 -- 1968 democracy, 1 election\n1968 -- 1980 dictatorship\n1980 -- 2016 democracy, 8 elections I ignore the period before the first dictatorship because it seems too far in the past. Of these 9 elections, 6 have been won by the more right-wing party. I will say the base rate is 67% for the more right-wing candidate. Apparently the two current candidates, Fujimori the daugher and Kuczynski, are right-wing and center-right respectively, so I'll start with a 67% chance of Fujimori winning. One major concern in elections is that incumbents have the advantage. But thanks to Peruvian law, the incumbent cannot run. As far as I can tell the incumbent party doesn't support either candidate. In fact, past election results are in favor of Fujimori here: Kuczynski ran against her in the 2011 elections and came in behind her (18% to her 23% in the first round). Another big concern in these elections is that Fujimori's father is a known criminal and human rights abuser (sentenced do 25 years in prison in 2009); but apparently this didn't stop people liking Fujimori the daughter better than Kuczynski in 2011. All this makes me adjust the probability of her winning substantially up, to 80%. I dunno, I can't recall a time when A had more votes than B in one election, and then that reversed in the next election. Another big concern in any election is the economy. It is well-known that when the economy is bad people get voted out of office, even if it's not their fault. But again neither candidate is an obvious continuation of the current left-wing government so I won't make any change to the 80% odds. Finally, current data [1]. The first-round election had Fujimori with 40% and Kuczynski with 21%. Polls for the second round put Kuczynski at 43%, Fujimori at 41%, and 16% undecided. This is a strange reversal but I think I can explain it by votes to more left-wing candidates going to Kuczynski (they decide early). The 16% undecided is a lot and I think more likely to be distributed randomly, and therefore expected to follow previous trends. Still, the slight advantage of Kuczynski, and the fact that all other candidates were more left-wing than the two, makes me revise Fujimori's chances down to 75%. So: Fujimori 75% to win.

Voting is compulsory in Peru.  Buying of votes and voter suppression is very common specially in poor, rural areas where Keiko is most popular.

The government of Ollanta Humala has been a dissapointment to so many people, specially with all the corruption and money laundering allegations involving his wife, Nadine Heredia (a well known scientologist who now leads the PNP party).  This, even more so that Alberto Fujimori's corruption case, may be the one factor leading peruvians to elect Keiko this time around.

This would make sense, but a) Peru, especially rural and young Peru, leans toward big changes and are distrustful of the political system http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/peru/2010-political-culture.pdf + the current leftist leader is very unpopular and distrusted.  This suggests that even though voters  may support leftist ideologies, they would not expect the leftist candidate Mendoza (who is of the same party as the current president) to be the answer.  She is sitting around 15-20% in most polls and that seems about right. 2)The other non Fujimori candidate, Kucynski, is pretty much tied with Mendoza in the polls.  At the same time, he is not a political insider (+) and has seen a steady increase in popularity in the past month (I know, momentum isn't really a thing in politics but still a soft +).  He has economic bonafides that the other 2 candidates don't (very soft +) and doesn't have any baggage (strong +, but I maybe overstating it).  At the same time, he will struggle with rural voters and does not  properly appeal to leftists (the left leaning party has the largest portion of the Peruvian legislature).  I have questions about his ability to mobilize the vote and if he can beat Fujimori for right-leaning voters. 3)Fujimori has lost before, few candidates in any country can bounce back from a loss (to be fair it was a close loss, so this may not be as large of a factor).  My concerns with her are voter fatigue both with her and her disgraced father.  The Peruvian people may be sick of the Fujimoris.  There is the whole corruption thing, but that hasn't really hurt her so far.  Peru seems to be leaning to the left right now, but only slightly.  The election is still her's to lose, but I think her advantage is very very small, and I have a hard time seeing her getting the 50% necessary to win the general.  The protests also hurt her.

With protests eruptingat Fujimori's rallies as a result of the Panama Papers she no longer the favored candidate in the second round against her current competitor Zucynski; who carriers no political baggage, and a strong political record.  Mendoza's rise from the single digits to double is one that should be closely followed in the next three days. Her record is anything but clean with numerous congressional hearings concerning everything from money laundering, and corruption, her defection from the nationalist party, and creating her own who's members are associated with violent anti mining clashes and existing sectarian cells in Peru. Her rise seems unlikely if not completely improbable.  Here is my analysis on why this rise has occurred. With the release of the Panama Papers, Fujimori has lost some ground in the polls and former supporters have moved to her competitors. What we know is that a Ipsos poll found that 35% of Fujimori's supporters backed her simply because she was a female candidate, followed by 23% who said she was the best qualified to reduce crime. These people would be the most disenfranchised by the release of Panama Papers. Those who are seeking a strong female candidate who will stand strong against crime instead of taking part in it fled to Mendoza's camp. Her rise is a symptom of Fujimori's growing unpopularity.

In the past three presidential election in Peru the runner up has had a substantial advantage in following presidential election due to a perceived incumbency advantage.   The front runner, Keiko Fujimori has that advantage and it's been reflected in the polls with her almost always leading by a 10-15% margin over her opponents in the first round of voting. However she still doesn't posses the needed 50% to skip the runoff vote. This margin however dropped when she was pared with former competitor, Julio Guzman in the second round of voting where her lead dropped to 2% with Guzman at 43% to Fujimori's 45% with a 2.3% margin of error.  Fujimori's luck turned however when the Peruvian National Election Board ruled that Guzman had not filed the proper paper work that would have official established his party and his candidacy putting his campaign on suspension with little hope of a successful appeal. Fujimori has only one other competitor that gets even within striking distance of her runoff polling numbers; that person being Pedro Pablo Kuczynshi.  An economist who's served time as the prime minister, as well as the minister of finance and of mining and energy during previous administrations, Kuczynski finished in third in the last election and has been polled 39% to Fujimori's 44%. While this margin is larger than that Guzman had before his suspension; the recent release of the Panama papers (which contained Fujimori's name) could embolden Kucynski's economic platform if he focused on tax and corruption reform at the expense of Fujimori's political standing. Bringing his runoff numbers closer to those Guzman had before his campaign was suspended.  I'm rating her chances of winning the election at 49% due to the fact that not only does she fail to achieve the 50% majority needed to skip the runoff but also because there is plenty of campaign time to go that Kucyznski could mount a successful campaign against her and win the election. http://www.as-coa.org/articles/explainer-whos-running-2016-peruvian-presidential-election"], [23438, "2016-04-06T17:24:30Z", [0.6], ""], [12302, "2016-04-06T15:36:11Z", [0.45], ""], [16026, "2016-04-06T15:14:29Z", [0.55], "Lowering the probability after the reports that she is backed by dirty money from the panama papers information.\n \"Panama Papers Reveal Keiko Fujimori Funded by Dirty Money\"\nhttp://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Panama-Papers-Reveal-Keiko-Fujimori-Funded-by-Dirty-Money-20160404-0037.html - Protest\nAlso the protest yesterday has clearly shown that there is a growing anger against her, and as media is going to cover extensively on this topic, people\u2019s distrust may increase.\nhttp://www.swissinfo.ch/fre/manifestations-anti-fujimori-\u00e0-cinq-jours-de-l-\u00e9lection-au-p\u00e9rou/42069726 - Determined non-voters\n\u201c 45 per cent of Peruvians say they will definitely not vote for her \u2014 higher than her two closest rivals, leftist lawmaker Veronika Mendoza and investor-favourite Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, according to the most recent Ipsos poll.\u201d\nAlthough the source for this poll number is not provided, almost 50% of people confirms that they are NOT voting for Fujimori.

Fuerza Popular (FP): Keiko Fujimori's party took 23% of the 1st round vote in 2011 and gained another 24.9% in the 2nd round, running against Ollanta Humala's left wing coalition (it moved to the center in the 2nd round, and allied with Peru Posible, a centrist party that had 16% of the 1st round vote). It also seems very likely that most of the Fujimori's gain in the 2nd round came from centrist parties, in effect splitting the centrists vote. That may not happen this election.  Currently Fujimori has fallen from 33% to 30% in the latest polls.  Strong on the current issue of crime reduction, yet her father remains an obstacle with some of the electorate.  And if the centrists can consolidate, FP may be boxed into a right wing corner. Failure of the centrist parties to settle on a single candidate in 2011 resulted in an election between a right wing party and a center left party.  Peru has around 25 parties contesting this year's election, even though many of the candidates are from parties that are from larger alliances.  For example, The National Solidarity Alliance, led by Luis Castaneda's National Alliance Party, also includes, among others Cambio90 (led by Renzo Reggiardo-who has left the Presidential race), Siempre Unidos (led by Felipe Castillo - has also left the race), and Todos por el Peru (led by Julio Guzman- who was just barred from running). Another case is the centrist \"Alliance for Great Change\" led by Luis Castaneda, also contained the \"Alliance for Progress\" led by the now barred Cesar Acuna.  \n------> Barring Guzman and Acuna, seem to allow the centrist parties to consolidate around three leaders (see below).  As long as one of the 3 centrist parties finishes 2nd in the 1st round of the election, Fujimora will have no significant voter block to gain in the second round.

With a population sample of ~1000, that gives Fujimori about a 65% chance of winning over Guzman in a runoff.  Per the article cited in the question, Guzman was recently declared ineligible. If his status remains as such (he's appealing his eligibility), then Fujimori wins hands down (barring any craziness), as no one else is close in the first vote or runoffs. If he becomes eligible, it will probably go to a runoff, and I give Fujimori the 65% chance of victory. The question now is how likely it is that Guzman will be made eligible. Since I have no priors, I'll give it a 25% chance since it seems more likely that election commissions want to stick with precedent if at all possible. Thus, Fujimori's chance of losing is .25*.35, or .09, giving her a 91% chance of victory. If anyone has better thoughts on whether or not Guzman will reenter, I'll change my forecast.
