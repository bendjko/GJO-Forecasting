The Sudanese government has already demonstrated a willingness to carry out such a campaign and the two ongoing conflicts in the country are as yet unresolved.   I project the base rate of a systematic campaign of civilian killings (per EWP definitions) in North Africa over the past 15 years to be roughly 8%.  There has been progress in the peace process, but the Sudanese economy is continuing to collapse.  Khartoum recently moved to restrict access to hard currency which will only exacerbate the inflation that is already causing mass hunger.  Sustained and increasingly severe famine increases the risk of violent conflict, and in Sudan government reprisals against civilians, by about 2% in the two years following the outbreak of famine.  Therefore, I'd estimate the likelihood of systematic killings of civilians topping 1000 in 2018 at about 9%.
