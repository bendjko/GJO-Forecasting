Recent media reports indicate there were ~240 fatalities (rather than just ~160) and more than 3,500 people arrested [3,4,5]. Ethnic conflicts between Oromo and Amhara may as well heat up. The prominent Oromo activist Jawar Mohammed and 30 of his supporters have been arrested - probably as an attempt to calm things down. We'll see if that'll work.

Protests are likely to continue in the next weeks. Depending on their longevity and the specific government response, there will be more (>500) or less fatalities (<500). Currently, it seems government forces won't deescalate as called for by international groups [2]. Nevertheless, international pressure may be critical to keep fatalities low. ~2300 people have been arrested so far ... so Abiy's government may be inclined to avoid large numbers of fatalities (>500 or even >1000) and consider more arrests in exchange. 4 weeks to go with a similar count would lead to ~640 fatalities. If things heat up, more fatalities won't be able to avoid (>1000). If things cool down, less fatalities are more probable (<500).
