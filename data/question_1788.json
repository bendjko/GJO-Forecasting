[1] However, according to this article, \"Manchester United have modified Old Trafford to accommodate 23,500 socially distanced spectators.\" [2] So even at highest capacity stadium, social distancing prevents 25,000 fans.  As a reference for what stadiums are doing around Europe, the Champions League has opened up to 30% capacity. \n\"Stadiums can be filled to a maximum of 30 per cent of capacity, except in cases where the local limit is lower. [Sept 24] Around 15,000 fans were present in the 67,000-capacity Puskas Arena in Budapest as Bayern Munich beat Sevilla 2-1.\" [3] Again, even at 30% capacity, no PL stadium reaches 25,000. Then the question becomes: when will fans be allowed to enter stadiums without social distancing. This could happen due to testing, low transmission rate, and/or vaccine. With cold winter weather, I think transmission and cases will continue to be bad. Vaccine rollout will hopefully improve things in early 2021, but not before March 16 [fourth bucket]. If UK vaccine rollout follows US, then general population will start to get vaccines in April, but two doses take 4-6 weeks, so effectively wouldn't be until late May. Therefore, after May 24 most likely.

NHS draft plan indicates a desire to vaccinate the majority of adults by mid-March. No mention of vaccines used or how logistical challenge overcome (particularly of note with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine). The draft plan relies also on 7 million doses being available in December to start preparations. Still awaiting any vaccine to be approved for use. But as of now there are four either awaiting approval in late phase 3. Even if the entire adult (willing) population is vaccinated by the middle of March, there will need to be a review period, this would take at least three to four weeks, to gather and publish data. That's mid-April before social distancing could conceivably be relaxed completely. Without relaxing social distancing no premier league ground can hold +25,000 socially distanced spectators (Old Trafford, the largest, falls short by >1,000), although reducing it to 1m would help, but I believe the 2m rule makes sense because it puts others out of arms reach. I should also point out that social distancing in stadiums is one thing, ensuring those fans are not squeezed like sardines onto buses and trains and tubes getting to and from the grounds is another matter altogether. This likely the reason why on Monday 23rd November a 4,000 cap was announced on outdoor sports attendances under the new tier system, rather than a percentage-based system or whatever clubs say they can social distance. The reasoning is that 4,000 people moving to and from a specific location at about the same time should be able to be soaked up by the transportation system without overwhelming it. There would enormous lines outside train stations and it would likely take hours and hours to get them home without a cap on attendance numbers. Or there would be gridlock on the roads around the stadium if people chose to drive. Increasing the probability of 16/03/21 - 23/05/2021 event to 12%, reducing after 24/05/21 to 88%. I have read suggestions around allowing +25,000 fans into stadiums if they can prove their vaccination status, and thus not be required to be socially distanced. I cannot see a policy like that being ok'd because it would exclude those who wish to be vaccinated, but have not had the opportunity.

That means, roughly, only 3/5ths of the games played in any given time period will have the chance of being over 25,000 with full capacity allowance. Man U's average attendance was 58,000 last season. Earlier in the month, a few of us were considering the potential for 33% capacity allowance and concluded that only Man U and Wembley were viable possibilities. However, not accounting for the deterrent of the virus and economic hardship, a 33% capacity would dwindle Man U's average attendance to <20,000; meanwhile, Wembley does not host premier league games so that's completely out of the question. That leads me to believe that the only chance this has before the end of the 2020/21 season is if the premier league manages to successfully trial mass, rapid testing of fans outside stadiums.

These tests are being trialled in the community this month (https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-millions-of-15-minute-covid-tests-being-developed-for-uk-says-pm-12105931). Even still, Man U would need permission for at least 45% capacity, based on averages; stocks of 15 minute tests; to organise the testing of over 25,000 fans pre-match and ascertain 25,000 negative results; and all of this, likely, after a trial period on limited capacity and waiting for the results of affects on infection rates.

A vaccine development this year, the commencement of spring, or a reduction in case numbers could result in the potential for a 25k+ match to be held towards the end of Q1.

Until today, there were plans for attendance at games starting in October. [1] Those plans have since been scrapped. If the second wave comes and goes quite quickly, I can see a big push to get crowds back in ASAP. Though, with flu season around the corner I'd be surprised if the UK shakes this wave quickly enough for stadium attendance to be back at all in 2020, let alone to the levels needed for this question to be resolved. Boris Johnson has said that the latest restrictions will likely be in place for 6 months, which takes us to past March. [2] @Averroes did the calculations and found that stadium attendance would need to be up to half capacity before this question is met. The trial attendance undertaken at the Amex was 2500 people [3]. We'd need ten times as many to be allowed in for this question to be met. With a one metre social distancing rule, it's estimated that you'd be able to get attendance up to about 30 percent [3].  To allow for stadium attendance without social distancing, you'd need either a) mass testing to guarantee that attendees were negative b) very low case rates c) a vaccine. At the moment, cases are high (4000+ a day) and testing is hard to come by. A vaccine available to the British public would be the silver bullet to resume full stadium attendance. Optimistic estimates have a vaccine being delivered in the New Year, with most estimates at more like Spring 2021. [4] In my pessimistic estimation, I have also accounted for the possibility that the season will be abandoned or postponed for a long time. We're already seeing teams weakened through having positive cases among their core squad (Laporte at City, for example). A combination of increased injuries due to a crowded match schedule and a number of players out with covid at any given moment might seriously deplete the number of healthly players in the league. Additionally, if the situation gets much worse in the UK, the Government might postpone the league (like they did in March) as part of a second lockdown.

Cases are expected to rise during Winter so dropping these measures seems unlikely in the first few months of 2021 as well.  After/around March time, it seems more likely that more fans will be allowed into stadiums. But this is dependant on case numbers. Using other European countries as a measure will be useful as they have been slightly ahead of England so far on a similar-looking graph. The Premier League season is set to end on May 23, 2021. The Euros start just after the end of the season and their rules may also have an impact on domestic decisions.
