I think it\u2019s important for people to know and understand that the threat that is posed by having thousands of U.S. military on the ground \u2014 still currently on the ground, implementing a mission, committed to a mission, as you heard General McKenzie and the President also say \u2014 that is a threat.  They are a target.  People gathering around the airport \u2014 that is a threat; that is a target. \nBut ISIS\u2019s ability to target individuals who are on the ground in Afghanistan is very different from ISIS\u2019s ability to attack the United States and attack the homeland.

Some Puerto Ricans sought to maintain their relationship with the mainland, and others, like the four visitors in the House that day, argued for an independent Puerto Rico. The Capitol had few security protocols at the time, and the four Puerto Rican nationalists entered the gallery armed with handguns. Around 2:30 p.m. they indiscriminately opened fire onto the House Floor and unfurled a Puerto Rican flag in a violent act of protest meant to draw attention to their demand for Puerto Rico\u2019s immediate independence. Five Congressmen were wounded in the shooting.

Many of these were foiled, and less than a third (~25-28% total) resulted in casualties. Based on this, we can expect roughly 20 terror attacks in the US from now to Sep 1 2021, if historical data holds. I don\u2019t think, it will, entirely - while COVID has reduced my estimate of \u201ctransnational\u201d terror, a CSIS report indicates that far-right terror was around 66% of attacks in 2019 and ~90% in 2020. Given that that is the primary factor, I would expect the impact of COVID to be minimal, if not an actually positive factor based on it being a divisive issue that has already driven armed confrontation (e.g. armed protestors storming a state house). Add to that the tensions in the US right now and far-right violence seems likely to rise in my estimation. So, from 2 per month in 2008-16, I\u2019m going to ballpark instead 3 per month going forward. This would result in 30 expected attacks between now and the end date of the question. Around a third, historically, had casualties at all - so 10 serious attacks. What are the odds that one of these meets the criteria of a CCTA? A search of UMD\u2019s Global Terrorism Database for 2017-18 (the latest data available) indicates 133 incidents (including unsuccessful) in the US, 20 of which resulted in 3 or more casualties (which I\u2019m using as a rough indicator of CCTA since that would seem to indicate some level of coordination/effectiveness). This would seem to indicate roughly 15% of attacks are successful CCTAs. Based on our estimate of 30 attacks between now and the end-date of the question, this would seem to estimate that 4.5/30 can be expected to be a successful CCTA. Yikes. Admittedly, my methodology is far from conservative; >=3 casualties can easily be a lone person, but on the other hand a CCTA could go wrong (they are complex, after all) and only result in 3 or fewer casualties.

This trend threatens to more quickly escalate confrontations between protesters and counter-protesters into violent clashes, which are occurring with increased regularity. In July 2019, only 17 counter-protests were reported around the country, or approximately 1% of all demonstrations, and only one of these allegedly turned violent. In July 2020, ACLED records over 160 counter-protests, or more than 8% of all demonstrations.

His Structural-Demographic Theory (and the associated quantitative model) have been forecasting a significant uptick in political instability (protests, riots, political violence, declining institutions and norms, etc.) in the U.S. beginning in 2020 since at least 2010. (Quick summary of his most recent thoughts can be found here[2][3]; his book 'Ages of Discord' goes into significant detail regarding the assumptions and inputs underpinning his model[4], which is in my view compelling).  Though he obviously did not forecast a pandemic in this year, his research shows that they tend to coincide with periods of political instability as institutions tend to be more fragile and less able to manage them effectively (sound familiar?).  Piggybacking off the work of @Tinned_Tuna, @juancambeiro and @WBHumanoid, it seems like the base rate is roughly 30-40%, minus some adjustment for COVID-19 related declines in travel / mobility and a broader decline in jihadist terrorism, plus (in my view) some adjustment for the greater likelihood of politically motivated domestic terrorism, inklings of which we've seen in the shootings in Kenosha, Portland, and even in statements made by administration officials[5] I will need to go back and see what the typical increase in domestic terrorism during these periods has been in the historical cases Turchin has studied (I seem to remember they are substantial), but for now will SWAG the total probability of a CCTA at 45%.

Perhaps terrorist attacks are 'held back' because they are waiting until there are more people out in public when COVID subsides to have a bigger impact, or they wait longer for an opportunity; but they can't hold themselves back for very much longer than they would otherwise. Maybe on average up to 30 days extra wait. I'll use TSA screenings [2] as a crude proxy for the impact of COVID: traffic is 0.35 of normal today.

Inside view: Adjust downward by 10%. Jihadist terrorism has declined since its recent peak in 2015 \u2014 \"The rise of ISIS has brought an unprecedented surge in terrorism cases ... As the years have passed since the peak of ISIS' influence [circa 2015], the number of terrorism cases has declined.\" [5] I don't see any immediate basis for another uptick in Jihadist terrorism. There is, however, reason to believe there may be far-left or far-right terrorist activity related to the 2020 presidential election. Scenario planning by the Transition Integrity Project found that \"A landslide for Joe Biden resulted in a relatively orderly transfer of power. Every other scenario we looked at involved street-level violence and political crisis.\" [6] But a good reason for thinking that there won't be election-related terrorist activity is that no such activity has been linked to the similarly polarized 2016 election. Thus, on the whole I think the drop in jihadist-related terrorist activity outweighs the potential for election-related terrorist activity.  Final: 30%. I thought it was bold of me to drop the probability of a CCTA in the next year by 25% (from 0.4 to 0.3) on the basis of a fall in jihadism since 2015, but the crowd is far bolder than I am (the current crowd forecast is a mere 7%!).

Is it a stretch for some prosecutor or district attorney to label some loss of life or act of violence during a protest as a terrorist event and attempt to take legal action with that body of law?"], [94837, "2020-09-12T14:58:15Z", [0.02], ""], [691, "2020-09-12T14:13:34Z", [0.03], ""], [90433, "2020-09-12T13:21:03Z", [0.05], "As most everything will be still shut down for the foreseeable future, there are simply not a lot of high crowd targets to hit"], [19127, "2020-09-12T13:07:57Z", [0.23], ""], [95165, "2020-09-12T12:59:27Z", [0.05], ""], [86678, "2020-09-12T10:31:01Z", [0.01], ""], [1333, "2020-09-12T10:30:19Z", [0.01], ""], [95719, "2020-09-12T06:28:47Z", [0.35], ""], [22147, "2020-09-12T06:10:26Z", [0.37], "Using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_the_United_States, I looked for attacks by multiple attackers between Jan 2000 - Dec 2019.

For example, the pipe bombing was at 01:40 AM. Some of the above attacks are hard to categorise, e.g. police stand-offs with \"sovereign citizen movements\" (May 20, 2010, December 8, 2003). Next, we need to use the definition of terrorism, which requires intent to coerce the population, change government policy, etc. I noted above that the Feb 2002 attacks may not be terrorism. The attackers say it was to extort money, not political change.  Overall, there are between 7 and 10 incidents, depending on how you count them. Note that two of these happened in 2015, so count them as \"1\" since we have at least one event in 2015, so we arrive at between 6 and 9 incidents. Therefore, I work out the base rate is between 30% and 45%. I use 37.5%.  Making adjustments because we've got less than a year left.: 1 - (1 - p)^365 = 0.375 => p = 0.00128685247... 355 days until 2021-Sep-01, and 1 - (1 - p)^355 = 0.366899... ~= 37% It's hard to know what to make of the long stretch of no CCTAs since 2015. There were still terrorist attacks since then, but they were no attacks listed that \"[involved] multiple perpetrators working in concert\". Maybe having Trump in power has pacified right wing and neo-nazi groups for the time? Maybe there will be a resurgence if Biden wins? I think I'll stick with the base rate since my gut is thoroughly conflicted."], [89013, "2020-09-12T03:32:52Z", [0.02], ""], [95100, "2020-09-12T02:55:20Z", [0.11], "dropping closer to my foreign-inspired prediction."], [95100, "2020-09-12T02:27:33Z", [0.16], "the last one was in 2015.

The list in the US is as follows: 2001 - Twin Towers Attack\n2007 - Virginia Tech Massacre\n2013 - Boston Marathon\n2015 - San Bernadino But this one defines coordinated a little differently, so based on this CCTA definition Virginia Tech doesn't count. So as a base rate you could say 3 in the last 20 years or a 15% chance one occurs in any given year. I'm going to go lower than that though because I started in 2001, which limits the sample to 20 years as opposed to a longer period, and it's possible these are anomalies over a longer term view.
