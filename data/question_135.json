The UN Security Council is set to discuss the proposals Thursday. A senior U.S. State Department official will also visit South Korea this week (Yonhap) to hold talks on a joint response to North Korea\u2019s nuclear tests. The draft resolution comes a week after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed new U.S. sanctions freezing assets of those doing business related to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.

That's why they have continued to have been been allies of sorts despite all that weirdness. Fairly or not, the Chinese public tends to see North Koreans as criminals, lazy, pathological liars, incompetent. The Chinese government has been encouraging citizens along the border to form militias, a scary thing for the government to do, suggesting desperation. Also, China has built a bridge to nowhere across the Yalu river bordering the two nations, quite substantial. https://www.nknews.org/2014/10/new-yalu-river-bridge-opening-postponed/  How much reality is there to this view of the North Koreans? Comparison class: South Korea gives lip service to reunification. But the reality is that NK \"defectors\" require considerable reeducation before they may be integrated into their society.\n\nAt the same time, China is terrified of Kim Jong Un and the Kool-Aid consuming religious cult that he heads. This religion, Juche, holds that NK founder Kim Il Sung descended from heaven and all his descendants are divine beings. They also worship a dangerously active volcano on the border between North Korea and China, Mount Paektu (AKA Baekdusan or Changbaishan mountain). Worse, North Korea has been conducting underground nuclear tests dangerously nearby, despite evidence that the giant magma chamber below the volcano has reinflated recently. Now the scientific community is concerned that nuclear tests could trigger a Plinian eruption such as occurred in 946 C.E.  http://www.nature.com/articles/srep21477\n\n\"The volcanic eruption in ~946 (namely, the Millennium eruption) had a volcanic explosive index (VEI) of 7 and tephra and pyroclastic flow volume of ~100\u2009km3; it is one of the largest explosive events in human history. The Millennium eruption produced pyroclastic flows of up to 100\u2009m thickness around the caldera and an ash fallout of 4\u20135\u2009cm in northern Japan.\" Bottom line: North Korea is huge threat to China, which therefore does not wish to strengthen it, but also does not want it to collapse. The middle way gets ever narrower. Approving increased sanctions could be a way to weaken Kim Jong Un's regime without destroying it.

The US is asking China to impose sweeping economic sanctions on Pyongyang, including an oil embargo \u201cMy sense from talking with the Chinese is that they were quite surprised that the US came to them with such a big ask,\u201d says Bonnie Glaser of Washington-based think-tank the Center for International and Strategic Studies. \u201cThey were expecting something along the lines of what had been done in the past \u2014 a marginally tougher UN Security Council resolution and tough rhetoric, and move on.\u201d \"One measure Washington has rolled out is a proposal to base a new anti-missile defence system in South Korea. This has infuriated Beijing, which says the Terminal High-Altitude Air Defence (THAAD) platform could threaten its own nuclear deterrent. \"The US has also said it will press ahead with tough unilateral secondary sanctions, with bills working their way through US Congress that could target some Chinese banks and companies working with North Korea. The measures are also intended to stiffen Beijing\u2019s resolve and make it consider cutting off its economic lifeline to Pyongyang.  \"Beijing, however, not only fears the consequences of further antagonising North Korea, it is also anxious to prevent the downfall of the regime. \u201cNorth Korea is a nuclear-armed country on the brink of collapse,\u201d says Zhao Tong, an expert on nuclear disarmament at the Beijing-based Carnegie Tsinghua Centre. \u201cMaking it into an enemy is the last thing China wants to see, because China can be directly threatened. I think it is unfair for the international community to make that demand on China.\u201d Beijing appears to have adopted a policy of publicly paying lip-service to tougher sanctions while privately working the levers behind the scenes. Wang Yi, foreign minister, told Reuters in Munich last week that the UN should adopt a resolution to ensure \u201cNorth Korea will pay the necessary price and to show there is a consequence for its behaviour\u201d. Meanwhile, China\u2019s foreign ministry has been railing against the deployment of THAAD. \u201cNot only is it a direct threat to China\u2019s strategic security interest, but also other countries in the region,\u201d it said on Monday. \"The US has been emboldened by the recent Iran nuclear deal, which showed how tough sanctions can work to change the behaviour of \u201crogue states\u201d. But these arguments do not appear to be working in Beijing, where there is real fear for stability on the Korean peninsula. \"When John Kerry . . . urged the Chinese government to embargo oil shipments to North Korea, he was rebuffed by Mr Wang . . . .\n\"Meanwhile, the opposite approach seems to be in the air in Beijing. Cui Lei, a researcher at the Beijing-based China Institute of International Studies, wrote a widely followed opinion piece in a Singapore newspaper last month advocating treating North Korea similarly to India and Pakistan, which both tested nuclear bombs in 1998.  \u201cIt\u2019s now pointless to deny that North Korea has gone nuclear,\u201d Mr Cui wrote. \u201cWe should readopt our India-Pakistan approach: acquiescence in North Korea\u2019s nuclearisation, while refusing to legalise it.\u201d . . .  \" Mr Zhao of the Carnegie Tsinghua Centre says most Chinese experts recognise the futility of trying to force North Korea into giving up nuclear weapons. He thinks Pyongyang\u2019s current nuclear capability can be implicitly accepted, and that the short-term focus should be freezing the programme.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I guess there's some hope for a UNSC resolution, but I'm not holding my breath.

I then turned that into a thousand simulations of voting in the Security Council (probabilities of agreeing with sanctions). \nI added an element that took into consideration the chance North Korea would shoot off another rocket or have a nuclear test before June 1, 2016 (my estimate was 50/50). The model last takes into consideration the Security Council members\u2019 post-satellite-launch statements about new sanctions.
