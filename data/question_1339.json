While the volatility of USD/CNY has spiked in recent years, it\u2019s still relatively calm compared to other financial instruments. As you can see from the graph in the link below the average annual realised volatility over the past 13 years has been 2.3%, although it has spiked in recent years. https://pasteboard.co/J1y2RVV.png  I\u2019m making this forecast over a very short time-period, which makes it easier. The historic 2.5 week (roughly how long till forecast date) realised volatility has been, on average, 0.55% (link below). https://pasteboard.co/J1y4hdO.png If we assume that the recent spike in vol persists (so say level of 1.75%), and we assume at most a 2 standard deviation move that gets us to a 95% chance of a price within: 7.0999 + 0.248 = 7.35\n7.0999 - 0.248 = 6.85\t Side note: All based on a normal distribution, which I know I know I know are not borne out in the real world.  But this na\u00efve outside view means it\u2019s going to take quite a lot to convince me to put much in any of the ranges outside 6.50 \u2013 7.50. Now for the inside view. Central banks all around the world have been cutting interest rates towards zero. The PBoC (People\u2019s Bank of China) have been conspicuous by their failure to do so. Indeed, Yi Gang, the governor of the PBoC published an article a few months back saying that the world\u2019s experiments with negative interest rates and QE have failed (http://www.qstheory.cn/dukan/qs/2019-12/01/c_1125288270.htm\n). So while the Fed are cutting rates to zero in the blink of an eye and buying every bond with a pulse, the PBoC have \u201csurprisingly\u201d cut rates only once by 20bps to 2.2% (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cenbank/china-unexpectedly-cuts-reverse-repo-rate-by-most-in-five-years-to-support-virus-hit-economy-idUSKBN21H0EM\n). This points to a strengthening of CNY vs. USD, although it may not play out in such a short timeframe.  The other consideration is the current USD funding squeeze and the Fed\u2019s actions to ease this (via swaps lines - https://www.ft.com/content/ce1101f6-ca10-40f3-bce8-b37617b9fd1e). This seems to be having some success in sending the dollar lower. All this makes me err more towards CNY strengthening until April 17th\n\nTo summarise:\nBase rates say highly likely to remain between 6.50 and 7.50 with a slight bias for 7.00 \u2013 7.50\nInside view has a slight bias for 6.50 \u2013 7.00.

After that the authorities are more likely let the CNY move above 7 and weaken their currency, especially if the US puts pressure on completing Phase 1 buys, in order to help Trump for his reelection bid. China won't let the CNY go completely, as too much of the external debt of the largest groups (especially real estate) is denominated in USD.

It reached a high of 6.8597  per USD on January 13th, 2020. China has also been under pressure from the USA to reduce its control over its currency. However, with the outbreak growing and China increasingly becoming closed off from the world economically, the CNY  weakened some to a 2020 low almost 7.0000 per USD in early February. This is a difficult forecast without any precedent. China's GDP is forecasted to fall to 4.5% growth according to a Reuters poll of Chinese economists (likely biased high). If the official numbers are this low or even lower than I expect the CNY to weaken to above 7.0000 per dollar. If the outbreak is quickly contained and GDP growth is between 4.5% and 6% I expect the CNY to stay fairly stable at just under 7.0000/USD.

The immediate effect is going to be to increase volatility, which implies a wider spread in the predictions. A secondary effect is that there will be stimulus packages that will likely lead to the depreciation of the RMB. A tertiary effect is that the exchange rate of 7.00 RMB per USD is no longer a line in the sand for the communist party, as they have other things to worry. The effect of the coronavirus epidemic belongs to the inside view, mostly. But first let us review the outside view with similar arguments to [1,2]. Two outside views: A) I take the average of the RMB exchange from 2014 till this year [3], they are: 2014: 6.16\n2015: 6.28\n2016: 6.65\n2017: 6.76\n2018: 6.63\n2019: 6.93 This suggest an average increase per year of 0.15, which shows a standard distribution of 0.113. For April 20, 108 days into the future, this would give a mu = 6.954, sigma = 0.061. The filling of the buckets would be 0, 77, 23, 0, 0. However this is not a good estimation of the variance, because it is dominated by the 108-day volatility (approximately the days from beginning of the year till 20th of April). If I take the annualized volatility to be 3.9%, this gives me a 108-day volatility of 2.0% and a sigma of 0.140, which is considerably higher than the previous one. Assuming independent errors and adding them in quadrature, the total sigma will be 0.153 and the buckets 0, 62, 38, 0, 0. B) For the second outside view, I use today's exchange (7.02, 3 of February), the time evolution obtained in A) calculated for April 20, and for the standard deviation I use last year's annualized volatility 3.9%, taken from Wolfram's Alpha application in my phone) divided by Sqrt[365/77] because there are 77 days left. The filling of the buckets is now: 0, 33, 66, 0, 0 However, now I include the inside view observation that volatility is going to increase. Today's volatility has been about 1.2%, which is relatively high. If this trend would continue, the 77-day volatility would be 10.5%, but this looks like a overestimation. If I average it with the expected 1.7% volatility for the next 77 days, this will give me about a 6.1% volatility.  With this the filling of the buckets is: 10, 35, 40, 14, 1 A+B) Gives an average of: 5, 48, 39, 7, 1 Now chances are that we need to move probability from the low buckets to the high buckets, because there are reasons indicating a reduction in the future value of the RMB. I will reduce the probability of the first bucket by 1/5 (moved to the fourth bucket) and the second by 1/2 (moved to the third bucket). This gives: 1, 24, 63, 11, 1 which is my final estimation for the moment.

The US Dollar-Yuan exchange rate is very volatile.  Recently it has been driven mainly by  the tariff war between the two countries.  I looked at the historical exchange rate (thanks to @sreichau from the reference to the historical data [1]) since the start of the trade war (January 2018 [2]).  At that time, the yuan started to weaken from 6.6 until peaking at 7.18 in early September 2019, an increase of almost 9%.  Since the announcement of the Phase 1 agreement in mid-October 2019, the yuan has strengthened, dropping to 6.9 on January 21, 2020, a drop of 4% from its peak. While the Phase 1 agreement does not resolve most of the trade issues between US and China, it does signal that both countries are working towards a resolution.  It is unlikely that the yuan will weaken again to above 7.0 as during the trade war.  At the same time, there are still lots of issues to be resolved, and therefore it is unlikely that the yuan to strengthen to the pre-trade war value of 6.6 or lower.  So as the two countries work on Phase 2 (or final) version of the trade agreement, the yuan will fluctuate in the middle range of its historical values during the early part of the trade war (between 6.6 and 7).  It might fall below 6.6 as the final agreement gets close, but it is not going to happen before 21 April 2020.

As in [1], I will begin with two outside views, A) and B) A) I take the average of the RMB exchange from 2014 till this year [2], they are: 2014: 6.16\n2015: 6.28\n2016: 6.65\n2017: 6.76\n2018: 6.63\n2019: 6.93  This suggest an average increase per year of 0.15, which shows a standard distribution of 0.113. For April 20, 108 days into the future, this would give a mu = 6.954, sigma = 0.061. The filling of the buckets would be 0, 77, 23, 0, 0. However this is not a good estimation of the variance, because it is dominated by the 108-day volatility. If I take the annualized volatility to be 3.9%, this gives me a 108-day volatility of 2.0% and a sigma of 0.140, which is considerably higher than the previous one. Assuming independent errors and adding them in quadrature, the total sigma will be 0.153 and the buckets 0, 62, 38, 0, 0.  B) For the second outside view, I use today's exchange (6.96, 3 of January), the time evolution obtained in A) calculated for April 20, and for the standard deviation I use last year's annualized volatility 3.9%, taken from Wolfram's Alpha application in my phone) divided by Sqrt[365/108] because there are 108 days left. The filling of the buckets is now: 0, 49, 51, 0, 0 A+B) Gives an average of 0, 55, 45, 0, 0 Now it is time to include the inside view, in which we have a symbolic trade deal in sight. But this temporary truce could be broken at any time by a thunderous tweet. Besides, it is still complicated to transfer money outside. So my expectation is that we have to add a multiplier for the low (< 7.0) buckets. Previously I used 0.5, but now I will use 0.7, as the situation is apparently more calm. This gives me the new buckers 0, 39, 61, 0, 0, which constitutes my new prediction.

Instead it moves within a daily peg. I will begin with two outside views, A) and B) A) I take the average of the RMB exchange from 2014 till this year [1], they are: 2014: 6.16\n2015: 6.28\n2016: 6.65\n2017: 6.76\n2018: 6.68\n2019: 6.88 (incomplete for 2019, but coincides with the last year average) This suggest an average increase per year of 0.144, which shows a standard distribution of 0.116. For the next six months this would give a mu = 6.952, sigma = 0.082. The filling of the buckets would be 0, 72, 28, 0, 0. B) For the second outside view, I use today's exchange (7.08, 22 of October), the time evolution obtained in A) for six months, and for the standard deviation I use last year's annualized volatility p3.9%, taken from Wolfram's Alpha application in my phone) divided by Sqrt[2] because there are six months left. The filling of the buckets is now: 0, 22, 74, 4, 0 A + B) The average is 0, 46, 52, 2, 0 This has to be complemented with the inside view: on the one hand, the depreciation of the RMB is an answer in part to the ongoing trade war, which is likely to continue, but also to the fact that the Chinese economic growth might be faltering to a greater extent than what official statistics say. On the other, capital controls in China are increasing and it's becoming more difficult to transfer money out, which indicates that the Chinese government is expecting the exchange to fall further. A way to take into account this is to reduce the probability of the buckets corresponding to a stronger RMB by a factor and then increasing the probability of the other buckets by the ratio of the new remaining probability for an increase over the old one. If I take a 50% factor, this reduces the stronger RMB buckets to 0, 23; the probability of a weaker RMB now increases from 54% to 77%, i.e. a factor of 1.43, which modifies the weaker RMB buckets to 74, 3, 0.  To summarize: 0, 23, 74, 3, 0 However, a factor of 30% could be more realistic if we follow the logic of @sreichau in his wonderful analysis: https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/917304 Yet I am inclined to think that the trade war is more likely to intensify (barring some symbolic concessions).

Therefore, I think approaches like frequencies of previous closes or models using previous volatility are limited (nevertheless, for lack of alternatives, I will be using them at least for some scenarios in this forecast)\n- To what extend the People's Bank of China will allow the CNY to weaken against the USD is a political question and should be seen in the context of the trade/tariff dispute between China and the US [1] Having said that, let's look at  ---\nBase rates\n---\nBased on historical USD:CNY exchange rates [2], 2010-10-21 until today (before that it looks from the graph like a (stronger) peg) Frequencies of previous closes in buckets: 56,41,3,0,0\nHistorical frequencies of %age changes for 125 day periods (same period as left on question) that would land in buckets: 0,42,52,6,0 \nAverage of the two above: 28,41,28,3,0 ---\nAdjustments\n---\nThere are two major scenarios here (that could and should both be looked at in a more nuanced way, but I won't for the sake of simplicity and lack of time for research in this first forecast): - Trade dispute continues at current or stronger intensity (scenario A)\n- Trade dispute continues at reduced intensity (or gets resolved completely, but probably not within the timeframe of the question) (scenario B) There is at least one report that claims there could be progress at the APEC meeting next month [3], which could lead to reduced intensity of the trade dispute. For now, I would put the probability of scenario B at 30% and assume that should this occur, the average of the base rates (frequency of previous closes and frequency of previous volatility over timeframes comparable to the question timeframe) would be the best forecast of the exchange rate.  In case of scenario A, I don't have a good idea of how much the CNY would be allowed to weaken - it will be a balancing act between generating political/economic pressure in the trade dispute and the negative impact of a weakening CNY (for example capital flight, inflation to name a couple). I am approximating the bucket probabilities for scenario a as 0,0,60,30,10.

Weakening the currency benefited exporters and counter-acted some of the effects of US tariffs. While drawing ire from the US, there were limited changes from Beijing.  The new trade (agreed to verbally, but not in writing) has some vague commentary on currency manipulation, but nothing concrete. Lower tariffs would support a stronger yuan, but no deal would support a weaker one. That being said, China\u2019s objectives must be considered more important than market forces given the amount of control they exert on the currency. This may make them hold off on further yuan devaluations regardless of whether a deal occurs. Given the control China exerts on its currency typical valuation models are less appropriate for this analysis. Setting a base rate has more to do with expectations on trade than past valuations. I think the Chinese CB has reason to support a weaker currency and is unlikely to surrender than power easily. As a result, I think 7 - 7.5 is the most likely range, but upside risk beyond 7.5 is limited.  Need to do some more research here.
