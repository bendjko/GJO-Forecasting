This marks an 87 percent decline since the technology was first introduced in 2010. This makes for an average of a 9.6 percent decline per year. [1] Assuming this same rate of decline, we can extrapolate an average price of $141.02/kWh in 2020. But many industry experts, including the Concern of Atomic Scientists, predict that cost-cutting will become more capital intensive in the next decade. [2] For the sake of argument, let's half that decline rate to 4.8 percent. This brings us to an upperbound of $148.52/kWh. On the other hand, a volume weighted analysis by BNEF shows an average price decline in excess of 17 percent per annum. If we use this figure, we forecast a figure of $129.48/kWh.

This is a range of $19.04. $0.52 of this ( $115-$130) makes up 2.7 percent of the total range\nThe next $15 comprises 79 percent of the range\n$3.52 of this is encompasses 18 percent of the range This is the way I thought about it. I know there's got to be a math guy out there having an anyuersm about my logic so please annihilate it in the comments. I would really appreciate the feedback.

Since we are relying on this methodology, we start with US$161 as the cost per kWh in 2019.  And the decline rate seems to be steady, 16% decline, kind of like a Moore's Law for batteries (which doesn't exist, at least no exponential one).  While there's no exact corollary, there has been a trend line in improvement in improving chemistries for production of kWh that helps drives prices per kWh downward, 5-8% (https://www.edn.com/do-lithium-ion-batteries-follow-moores-law/).  McKinsey, one of the sources in the spreadsheet provided, made a pretty good estimate back in 2012, that missed, ($200 by 2020, $160 by 2025; a lot once inflation is accounted for) but I thought it was interesting (https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/battery-technology-charges-ahead). In any case, the simple forecast is taking the $161 2019 figure and reducing it to $135 for 2020.  However, with the world under Shelter-In-Place order, demand for commodities should fall, causing the prices of the chemicals necessary for building the batteries to drop further.  So I'm going with 40% in 115-130 and 60% in 130-145, as I think given the trend of 16% has been pretty steady, it should be around 135, but with drop in global output (GDP), prices will fall, so there's a good chance of the price falling below $130, as calculated by the methodology.

Also, I was not able to quickly find the raw data for the diagram in the article, such that I had to eyeball the per year deviation from the regression line (which is likely to distort the results because of the logarithmic plot) It does seem plausible that there was an increase in price both in 2012, 2015 and 2019.

But I don't think this is taking into account that Tesla \u2013\u00a0who produce something like 50% of the batteries appear to have the cheapest production price by far. So if it were a weighed average based on the level of production, then I think the number would be lower. For example, if Tesla produce batteries at $100 per kWh and ten other companies produce batteries at $200 per kWh, you may add 10x200 to 1x100 and average that out between 11 producers to get a mean total average of $190 per kWh. But if Tesla produce 50% of the batteries at $100 per kWh and the other 50% are being produced at $200 per kWh, then your weighted average would be $150 per kWh for the industry. So this makes a big difference. It's worth noting that even in the study linked above, there's no clarity on the price being for the cell, module or pack. Tesla will be holding their Battery and Powertrain Investor Day on 20(ish) April 2020. Expect them to announce either a current price around or under $100 per kWh, or a roadmap to this. In fact, if they are announcing how they will scale to TWh of production, expect a roadmap to a far cheaper price. Plus, if Tesla alone can scale to TWh of batteries, that weighted average argument would bring the cost down significantly. Depending on what Tesla announce in April, I'll be back to refine my number, because I anticipate they'll be increasing their contribution to the global total production significantly. Compound that with increased EV sales (by percentage, not total because this year will be terrible for car sales) and I think prices will drop quite a lot."], [691, "2020-04-04T15:26:33Z", [0.01, 0.1, 0.58, 0.3, 0.01], ""], [706, "2020-04-04T01:02:54Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0], ""], [172, "2020-04-03T22:24:46Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2020-04-03T21:29:02Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.6, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [38094, "2020-04-03T17:05:40Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.85, 0.15, 0.0], "There will be difficulties working from home with kids underfoot rather than in the quiet of the lab.
