could speed up talks on its lesser-known Asia-wide equivalent, trade analysts say. \nNegotiators working on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) are currently in the middle of a week-long meeting, the 10th of its kind, in Busan, South Korea. \n\"I am not 100 percent sure whether the RCEP deal will be struck as soon as this week but the stakes are now higher for RCEP members, especially those that are not in the TPP, because they realize that they are losing out,\" said Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit, assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). \n\"This mindset of 'losing out' could tempt these non-TPP countries in RCEP to reach a deal very soon,\" she added in an email interview with CNBC. \nDeborah Elms, executive director at Asia Trade Centre, agrees: \"The TPP has been viewed [with a fair amount of skepticism] by many of the RCEP countries. They were working towards a deadline at the end of the year ... but they were not under a great deal of pressure. Now that the TPP is closed, I think the pressure for some kind of high quality result out of RCEP is likely to mount.\" \nAccording to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, countries participating in the regional free trade deal will this week discuss guidelines for market liberalization and draw up a list of products to be liberalized for each country. Other trade issues, including economic cooperation, legal systems, trade barriers and e-commerce will also be on the agenda. \n\"We are not sure what the outcome will be at this stage, but we hope there will be good progress. Expectations are high.

However, it won't be easy to achieve this. The RCEP negotiations, launched during the 21st ASEAN summit in November 2012, has been given too much symbolic meaning. Some people view the talks of the TPP and RCEP as Washington's and Beijing's efforts to distinguish each other's circle of friends. Additionally, the RCEP has received an increasing amount of attention from the world as it will boost stronger economic ties among big powers including Japan, China and India. It is precisely because of this symbolic meaning that the RCEP negotiations face severe challenges from a geopolitical perspective. Some RCEP members lack mutual political trust or have been affected by territorial disputes. For instance, conflicts surrounding the South China Sea have damaged China's ties with some Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Additionally, competition between India and China is a sensitive topic. It is clear that nationalist sentiment, which can be agitated by any of the conflicts among RCEP members, will be an obstacle in completing the RCEP negotiations (\u00b61-3). Weijia, H. (2016).

The ministers also gave strategic and targeted suggestions, especially on the core areas like cargo, service and investment. They urged the member countries to keep participating in the negotiation in a positive and constructive attitude\" http://www.asiantradecentre.org/talkingtrade//rcep-status-update\n\"There are four potential outcomes for RCEP at this point. \nFirst, RCEP could simply fail.  This would be deeply problematic, but not entirely unexpected.  In a time period when trade is facing strong headwinds in many places, getting a large Megaregional off the ground is tough.  RCEP members have massive gaps in every conceivable dimension.  Toss in new political and security tensions and the glue holding together these diverse 16 countries may be insufficiently strong to get a result.\nSecond, RCEP could conclude as planned at the end of the year.  The agreement will not be good.  There is physically too much to do and too little time to do it well.  Leaders could certainly fudge the issue and leave the deal in the \u201clegal scrub\u201d or \u201ctranslation\u201d for one-two years while officials race to nail down all the details.  But this is risky since talks could actually derail if the agreement is not really close to conclusion.\nThird, RCEP could close with a \u201cbuilt-in agenda.\u201d  This would allow the talks to finish on schedule and let talks continue on everything that is not done.  But ASEAN\u2019s track record of built-in agendas is not great.  As a case in point, the very first item on the AEC Blueprint 2025 is to conclude everything not finished in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2016 but progress has been glacial as July draws to a close. \nFourth, RCEP could announce an \u201cearly harvest\u201d and keep negotiating through 2017.  This is not a desirable outcome for many dialogue partners who want to keep up the momentum for a higher quality outcome.  But the pressure for some sort of concrete result is high, particularly for some RCEP parties.

While it was not listed in the original \u201cguiding principles,\u201d that document does have a section on \u201cother issues,\u201d where topics that some RCEP members have covered in other FTAs can be raised for possible discussion, and potentially agreement. \"Regarding RCEP draft texts, officials reported progress in the latest round, though more remains to be done. Negotiators are also working to establish terms for a dispute settlement mechanism under the working group in charge of legal and institutional aspects.  \" . . .  negotiations are considering transparency as well as facilitating customs procedures and enhancing trade facilitation, especially addressing NTMs and technical barriers to trade (TBT). There has also been a proposal for a dedicated chapter on trade facilitation. \"According to Trainor, some provisions that are not addressed in the WTO\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) are still under negotiation in RCEP, including some aimed at making SMEs\u2019 exports cross borders expeditiously. The TFA is currently in the ratification process and is not yet in force. \"RCEP negotiations are also taking place on rules of origin and competition as other ways to facilitate SMEs\u2019 participation in trade, along with e-commerce. \n. . .\n\" . . .  the goal of clinching a deal by year\u2019s end . . .would likely be the earliest for reaching a possible deal. \"One complicating factor is that not all participating countries have an FTA with their RCEP partners. For example, there is no FTA between China and India, although both countries have been considering a potential agreement since 2003. There is also no FTA between China and Japan, although the China-Japan-Korea FTA is under negotiation. (See Bridges Weekly, 5 November 2015)  As a result, RCEP negotiations need not only to construct a large regional agreement but also build FTA relationships that currently do not exist. Participating countries also have different levels of economic development, which some say could further complicate the process.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I note that negotiators have just received all drafts, and that the report mentions \"initial\" offers and lists, requests, the possibility of additional issues, consideration of proposals and that not all participating countries have an FTA with their RCEP partners, all of which sounds to me like the negotiations are in the very earliest stages.

This is expected to make India more aggressive in the upcoming negotiations, seeking greater market access in services to be able to justify the closing of the deal at home, where an apprehensive local industry views it as equivalent to signing a free trade agreement with China. \"The next round of RCEP negotiation will take place in Perth, Australia, during 23-29 April. \"A commerce ministry official said India will quote its revenue loss figure and ask other countries how much they are sacrificing. \u201cWhile their definition of a balanced outcome is if everybody\u2019s tariff lines come to zero, we think from what level you bring down your tariffs to zero is important. Secondly, if I am sacrificing this much revenue, how much are other countries sacrificing? These are questions that will certainly be asked inside negotiating rooms. Why a trade negotiation should be completed without proper balance in the deal,\u201d the official said, on condition of anonymity. The official said that if balance cannot be achieved in goods, other countries need to give greater market access to services from India. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give anything in services and the goods deal is also not balanced, then why should I sign the deal? What is my hurry to complete it? Ultimate issue will always be whether the price is right,\u201d he added. \"India, due to its higher tariff wall, ends up cutting its tariffs more significantly in such bilateral or plurilateral trade negotiations, while other countries, due to their already low tariff lines, need only to reduce them marginally. India thinks its best bet is in services export, through which it can supply its burgeoning skilled professionals to other countries, thus partially meeting the demand for jobs from a million people joining the labour market every month.\n. . . \n\"India is also seeking a visa on arrival regime for business travel and tourism with the 16 RCEP member countries. \u201cAsean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries provide visa-free travel among themselves and also to some countries outside Asean region.

In the meeting, India is expected to press for greater market access in services sector, particularly easy movement of professionals, an official said. \"The 11th round of talks was concluded last month in Brunei. The 12th round of negotiations is scheduled at Perth in Australia from April 22,\" the official said. Besides liberalisation of the services sector, the other issues, which may come up in the talks include matters related to goods tariffs. \"In the goods sector, India has asked the members to fulfil their commitments as their current offers are not up to the level they have committed,\" the official added. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a mega trade deal which aims to cover goods, services, investments, economic and technical cooperation, competition and intellectual property rights. As part of its goods proposal, India has not offered any duty cut on steel to China, Australia and New Zealand in the proposed free trade agreement among 16 Asian members. The RCEP talks started in Phnom Penh in November 2012. The 16 countries account for over a quarter of the world\u2019s economy, estimated to be more than USD 75 trillion. The RCEP deal is also important amidst the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement led by the US. Indian industry is apprehensive that TPP would impact Indian exports. India already has free trade agreements (FTAs) with the Asean grouping, Japan and South Korea. India has offered to open its market the most for Asean countries \u2014 with which it has an FTA in place \u2014 and has proposed to eliminate duties or tariffs on 80 per cent of items for the 10-nation bloc. Similarly, for Japan and South Korea, it has offered to open up 65 per cent of its product space. For Australia, New Zealand and China, Delhi has proposed to eliminate duties on only 42.5 per cent of products. As India does not have any kind of FTA with these three countries, its offer is less. The 16-member bloc RCEP comprises 10 Asean members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam) and their six free trade agreement partners \u2014 India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.

Mar 5: \"RCEP talks to stretch longer on differences over services\" --> http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/rcep-talks-to-stretch-longer-on-differences-over-services/219805/ The negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) involving 16 countries could slow down in the coming months due to a lack of consensus over services. Some members are unwilling to show flexibility in discussing liberalisation of the services sector, and are instead seeking more relaxation in goods, while India wants a greater commitment from them on services, as it has shown in offering to remove barriers in goods trade, sources told FE. India will likely step up its demand for a deal on services in Perth in Australia where the 12th round of RCEP negotiations are scheduled to take place from April 22. The absence of a consensus on services may further delay the negotiations, which have already missed the 2015 deadline for conclusion, even as pressure piles up on the bloc to clinch a deal following the Trans-Pacific Partnership between the US and 11 other countries. India is of the opinion that a liberalisation of services, such as further relaxation in visa regime for a freer movement of professionals, should be addressed along with that of goods, while some other members seem to be interested only in goods, they added. The country is keen on services, as they account for over a half of its GDP. Some of these members want that a clear-cut ministerial mandate has to be reached first on services at the RCEP before such issues can be taken up, while India argues that even the current mandate doesn\u2019t prevent any discussion on them, said the sources. India is also miffed that while it has taken its initial offer of removing import duties on 42.5% of tariff lines on goods seriously, many Asean nations that are part of the negotiations haven\u2019t progressed much on their offers. The movement of natural persons is one of the four ways through which services can be supplied internationally. Also known as \u201cMode 4\u201d, it covers natural persons who are either service suppliers (such as independent professionals) or who work for a service supplier and who are present in another member to supply a service. India has a vast pool of skilled workers, especially in the IT sector.\n~~~ COMMENT: It's important to note that they've still got three more rounds of negotiations (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/99504).
