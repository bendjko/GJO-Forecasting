Although there is a clear downward trend (and as their economy reaches maturity the percentage will no doubt lower) I believe a sudden drop to 4% or less would be too much of a shock to the markets and rock faith in the Chinese economy. The narrative at the moment is centred around China's strength and their rapid tackling of COVID-19. They are increasingly seen as an authority in the handling of the outbreak and their figures indicate they have almost fully contained it. Meanwhile, the outbreak in other countries are only just beginning, sliding up the exponential curve, and are soon to overwhelm many healthcare systems. While other countries will talk of unity and hard times, I think the Chinese messaging will be more around recovery and strength amidst disaster everywhere else.

One way to forecast the impact of Covid-19 is to subtract 2 pp from the forecast 5.8-6.0%, yielding 3.8-4% GDP growth for Q1 2020.

In 2003, the types of industries that were most affected by government-imposed bans on travel and other measures to contain the outbreak\u2014such as retail, restaurants, entertainment, and tourism\u2014accounted for 42% of GDP. Since then, services industries\u2019 share of GDP has risen to 54%. Back in 2003, China\u2019s GDP was an insignificant 4% of the global total.

The Chinese economy is now much more service-oriented and reliant on supply chains for both domestic & foreign trade. Many nations have imposed travel bans to/from China. Chinese citizens are voluntarily reducing domestic consumption due to voluntary isolation. More importantly, there is growing fear and distrust of the government among the Chinese public. Based on the long incubation time and difficulty in controlling spread, I do not think nCoV will be controlled anytime soon. Thus, the contagion of fear negatively impact the Chinese economy (and worldwide). \nI believe nCoV will result in an drop by >3% this year, but Q1 2020 may be too soon to feel the full impact.
