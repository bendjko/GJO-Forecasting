Of the votes that Provoste got, 80% might go to Boric, but 20% of the left-center DC won't. We can split that 10% won't vote, 10% for Kast. Sichel's Vote, 80% will go for Kast, 0% Boric, 20% won't vote. Artes votes will be 95% Boric and 5% most likelt won't vote (extremely hard left). of MEO, 90% for Boric and 10% won't vote. Parisi, 70% Kast, 10% Boric and 20% won't vote. In that calculation, 51.9% will go for Kast and 48.1% for Boric. I have 60% confidence in that result.\nIf 90% of Provoste votes goes to Boric (10% DC just won't vote) and 100% of the hard left, Kast gets 50.3% and Boric 49.7%. That would be 10% probablity\nThe threshold is Parisi. if the vote thas goes to vote is split 90% Kast 10% Boric (the love of the hard left in those voters is much less powerfull than the fear of the hard left, and Parisi has a Mesianic attitude which his voters will follow and he destroyed Boric economic program in his show). So, any situation where more than 30% of Parisi voteers don't vote, that takes us to a Boric win. This is a true probability of ocurrence, which is 30%.\nin those scenarios, 70% indicate Kast wins and 30% Boric wins The other Wildcard are the new votes. In the Pi\u00f1era-Guiller election, 6.7mm people voted on first round and 7mm in second round. 300k different. \nIn the Referndum, 7.6mm people voted.\nI'll add 500k to get to 100k of the referendum votes, a total of 7.5mm.\nThe split here is if Boric gets +52% of that new vote, then it's his election. But normally people who don't vote in the first round are less passionate of politics and not follow a hard party, where Kast presents a show of more stability. Boric would have to win a significant amount of those votes to end up as the president elect. Thus, I give a 70% chance of Kast winning by a very slim margin, 51% of votes for Kast to 49% of votes for Boric"], [1333, "2021-12-15T08:37:31Z", [0.68, 0.0, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-12-15T04:31:40Z", [0.68, 0.0, 0.32, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-12-14T23:17:12Z", [0.5, 0.02, 0.47, 0.01], ""], [96828, "2021-12-14T23:14:11Z", [0.47, 0.05, 0.47, 0.01], ""], [691, "2021-12-14T15:53:47Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0], "https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-election-poll-shows-race-tightening-polarized-showdown-nears-2021-12-14/\nI really hate close elections, especially if I have to care about the outcomes. . . .\n"], [1333, "2021-12-14T14:46:26Z", [0.67, 0.0, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-12-14T12:32:22Z", [0.52, 0.05, 0.42, 0.01], ""], [95992, "2021-12-14T02:19:32Z", [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-12-13T18:46:22Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [88452, "2021-12-13T14:32:28Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [100653, "2021-12-13T08:46:27Z", [0.7, 0.01, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [95766, "2021-12-13T07:15:18Z", [0.33, 0.0, 0.42, 0.25], ""], [1333, "2021-12-13T01:49:42Z", [0.55, 0.0, 0.45, 0.0], ""], [94837, "2021-12-12T07:16:14Z", [0.6, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0], "Boric' opponent Kast seems to be under pressure after the NSDAP membership of his father (which Kast was denying) was apparently confirmed. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/08/chile-jose-antonio-kast-father-nazi-party\nThis may make it more difficult for Kast to portray Boric as \"radical\".
