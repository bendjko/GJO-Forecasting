First, Bolsonaro, while failing to reach an absolute majority in the first round of elections, he received 46% of the vote to Fernando Haddad's 29%. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45780176) Thus, Bolsonaro, at worst, only needs to win an additional 4% of votes in the runoff scheduled for 28 October to win the presidency. It is likely that some voters will vote for a candidate who is not Bolsonaro or Haddad, thus he does not necessarily have to reach 50% Second, all recent polling has demonstrated that Bolsonaro will be afforded significant support for the runoff. Polls range indicate a broad lead for Bolsonaro as polls have him winning around 57-60% with Haddad wining about 40-43%. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-poll/brazil-election-poll-shows-bolsonaro-has-57-percent-vs-haddad-43-percent-idUSKCN1MW2BN) Such results should be viewed as valid as they are well out of the poll's margin of error. Lastly, Brazilian citizens are overwhelming looking for the reestablishment of law and order in the presidential election, due to a substantial increase in crime in Brazil in recent years. Thus, Bolsonaro who has run as the \"law and order\" candidate and one to reassert traditional family values is best situated to fill the nation's desire. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-01/your-guide-to-brazil-s-wildly-unpredictable-election-quicktake) On the contrary, Haddad has been portrayed as weak(er) on crime and security and has focused more on socioeconomic issues. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-01/your-guide-to-brazil-s-wildly-unpredictable-election-quicktake).
