While we still hope for the best, we continue to prepare for this virus to become widespread in the United States\u201d (Para. 1). In California, at least 40 cases have been reported. Twenty-four cases were people who caught the virus either on the Diamond Princess cruise ship or in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first reported, and were then repatriated to the U.S. and quarantined at California military bases. An additional 19 cases were in returning travelers or, in at least five instances, people who contracted the virus in their community (Para. 1-2). {{After Feb 20th}} On Feb. 26, the county declared a local health emergency in response to the coronavirus (Para. 9). The move was largely in response to a proposal to move coronavirus patients to a facility in Costa Mesa, which sparked a bitter court battle. The federal government has since retreated from the plan.\nPlacer County\nA healthcare worker in Placer County was confirmed as a presumptive positive case of the virus, pending confirmation from the CDC. The individual is isolating at home. The individual is a NorthBay VacaValley Hospital worker who came into close contact with a previously confirmed case in Solano County, before that individual was transferred to another hospital and tested for the virus (Para 12). Sacramento County\nA Sacramento County resident who returned to the U.S. from China on Feb. 2 was found to have the virus, officials announced Feb. 21 (Para 13). Santa Clara County\nOf the nine cases in the county, at least four were linked to travel (Para 21).\nThe fourth case, announced Friday, was a close contact of that woman and is doing well, officials said. She was not ill and was isolated at home (Para 26). The county announced its fifth, sixth and seventh coronavirus cases on Sunday (Para. 27)\n/\nAn older woman was hospitalized at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital with fever illness and transferred to UC Davis Medical Center, where she was eventually diagnosed with COVID-19, officials announced Wednesday. She was \u201cin her community\u201d for several days before accessing care, officials said (Para. 34). The woman had not recently traveled to a high-risk area, nor had she been in contact with someone with the virus. She was not tested for several days because she did not fit screening criteria set by the CDC at the time. The guidelines have since been revised. More than 100 people, most of whom were health workers, have been asked to self-quarantine because of contact with the woman. The CDC has dispatched a team to help local officials identify others who may have come in contact with her (Para 36). '\nReference\n'\nWigglesworth, A., Karlamangla, S. & Shalby, C. (2020).

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina) Also speaking generally, the U.S./California may (currently) have better prevention, detection, and quarantine methods than some other countries. Though that could be under some dispute by a key group: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/nurses-concerned-over-growing-number-of-coronavirus-patients/2238162/ Also, there are still some unknowns on exactly how coronavirus is transmitted, including possibly asymptomatically: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html, https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/can-coronavirus-be-spread-people-who-don-t-have-symptoms-n1140106 To start off I tried a simple calculation - which I'm not going to bother replicating in the comments - involving calculating an average rate of new U.S. cases per day (based upon CDC reports to date) extrapolated over the next thirty days, and multiplied by an arbitrary \"virus expansion factor\", then multiplied by an estimated percentage of such new cases within California.
