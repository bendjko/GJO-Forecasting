In fact, the agency\u2019s drone count currently stands at zero.  Instead, the United Nations food assistance branch has been putting drones in the sky only as part of a project to establish clearer guidelines for the humanitarian sector at large. . . . . we decided we are not going to deploy any until we sort this out and establish a practice,\u201d said Haidar Baqir, information technology emergencies officer for the WFP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau. Several country-level communities of practice for the humanitarian use of drones already exist around the world, with nongovernmental organizations as partners to share the costs of flying drones and the data produced, often following a disaster. In Nepal, Tanzania, and Peru, \u201crobotics for good\u201d company WeRobotics has established \u201cflying labs\u201d to transfer relevant skills and technologies to local partners to incubate new drone businesses. The Belgian-funded WFP initiative that Baqir is heading up aims to collate those ideas to design solutions for the coordination of UAV use in the broader humanitarian community, addressing safety and data protection risks along the way. The result, Baqir hopes, will be an official partnership framework and accompanying code of conduct by early 2018 whereby drone deployment in emergencies will be managed by one humanitarian aid cluster in a transparent way. UAVs are increasingly being recognized by humanitarian organizations for their potential effectiveness in disaster response, helping teams safely observe situations in real-time during emergencies or quickly collect damage assessment information in remote areas. Drones can also provide \u201cWi-Fi in the sky\u201d to get communities back online following a disaster, an idea the WFP has been experimenting with. At the same time, overuse or improper use of drones following disasters in the past few years have left many aid groups wondering how to move forward responsibly. Several organizations already exist to help educate people about best practices, such as WeRobotics \u2014 which is partnering with the WFP on the drone coordination initiative \u2014 and the Humanitarian UAV Network, both founded by humanitarian technology and innovation expert Patrick Meier. But the WFP project is the biggest effort on the international stage to professionalize drone coordination throughout the sector \u2014 and it can\u2019t come soon enough, according to Meier.\n. . . \nIn the Philippines, drone company SkyEye has been providing aerial mapping and disaster response surveying services for several years. . . . Following a disaster, SkyEye might map affected schools for Save the Children. World Vision might overlay data on damage per house while the IOM surveys those who may have lost homes and will need to move into alternate housing.  . . .  The single biggest challenge to drone use for humanitarian aid remains local regulations that were usually created for commercial drone use, according to Meier, who saw this again recently in the South Pacific while piloting drones for the World Bank\u2019s UAVs for Resilience program. . . .  Once standards and regulations have been set, it\u2019s time to look closer at coordination, which is the biggest mandate of the WFP\u2019s current project.  Ideally, Baqir said, drones would live under the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster, which is led globally by the WFP and is one of 11 clusters that identify key humanitarian sectors during emergencies. Requests for information would filter through the cluster, which would already have established partners it could call on for in-country coordinators, drone pilots and data analysts as needed, and be responsible for the government permissions process.  If a request is deemed suitable for drone technology use, the cluster would then coordinate flights to avoid overlap.  . . .  \u201cWe hope by next year we are deploying drones not for the sake of deployment, but because there is a need and a gap \u2026 And that we have an established practice rather than an ad hoc situation; that is our goal,\u201d Baqir said.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I see many obstacles to a positive resolution of this question:  1)  the cost of UAVs, 2) their limited payload capability, 3) that this question requires that they be used in a conflict zone, and 4) the requirement that they be used to \"deliver aid\"--presently they seem to be used only for damage assessment."], [29591, "2017-11-06T20:56:06Z", [0.19], ""], [53, "2017-11-06T20:38:41Z", [0.1], "Really only updating to add this cool article about disappearing drones: https://slice.mit.edu/2017/11/06/drones-disappear-morse-corp/\n"], [368, "2017-11-06T19:17:47Z", [0.0], ""], [31317, "2017-11-06T04:54:06Z", [0.05], ""], [23234, "2017-11-06T01:35:23Z", [0.08], ""], [368, "2017-11-05T22:50:38Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-04T22:14:20Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-11-03T17:45:38Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-03T15:26:53Z", [0.05], ""], [691, "2017-11-02T19:07:44Z", [0.06], ""], [368, "2017-11-02T17:39:33Z", [0.0], ""], [32294, "2017-11-02T14:46:53Z", [0.01], ""], [31683, "2017-11-02T00:01:24Z", [0.35], ""], [368, "2017-11-01T22:06:28Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-01T18:43:59Z", [0.06], ""], [691, "2017-10-31T22:38:24Z", [0.08], ""], [29591, "2017-10-31T20:57:05Z", [0.25], "Lowering considerably due to no recent news of organisations testing prototypes in the field.

The group, formed solely to help with Harvey relief efforts, was initially tasked with helping the American Red Cross with post-Harvey aid \u2014 but its efforts were hampered by an unnatural force that often wreaks havoc on innovative ideas: bureaucracy.\n\u201cDon\u2019t attach yourself to any one organization. We learned that with the Red Cross,\u201d Humanitarian Drones member Ty Audronis told Digital Trends. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re a fantastic organization, but they\u2019re really big, and with a big organization comes a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of opinions. So, while they were figuring out whether or not they wanted us to help them, we should\u2019ve been out helping other people at the same time instead of waiting on them.\u201d \"But these gripes may soon be things of the past. Norwegian drone maker Griff Aviation is making a fleet of drones capable of carrying upwards of 1,100 pounds \u2014 enough to lift a few people at one time. The company\u2019s Griff Saviour almost seems made for hurricane rescue efforts, with its 440-pound lift capacity, water-resistant motors, and ability to deploy lifesaving equipment. The drone\u2019s price tag \u2014 a whopping $250,000 \u2013 will likely make this bird prohibitively expensive for hobbyists and local governments alike.\nOn top of that, ADS-B location reporting tech might soon make its way into consumer UAVs. DJI\u2019s Matrice 200 drone boasts the company\u2019s own ADS-B transponder, called Airsense. If more companies follow suit, air traffic controllers would be able to track drones just like they track full-sized aircraft \u2014 and more importantly, help them avoid collisions during disaster relief efforts.\"\nComments: General Atomics already has a modified Predator with heavy-lift capability available to aid groups. \"THE WAY FORWARD\nClearly, we need a better system in place. Days after Harvey touched down in Texas, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta predicted \u201cthe hurricane response will be looked back upon as a landmark in the evolution of drone usage in this country.\u201d\nHis prediction is already coming true. The American Red Cross recently announced it will fly a drone for the first time to assess damages as part of its new drone program for disasters. Similarly, the Air National Guard recently deployed military drones normally used for combat to help survey disaster areas. So while the ball might have been dropped as far as using UAVs to help out during the 2017 hurricane season, we\u2019re already learning from our mistakes.\nAs soon as lawmakers and UAV manufacturers embrace the legitimate lifesaving potential of drones, the world will be a safer place.\" Related:\nNew [drone] website launched a couple of days ago: Drone Major: http://dronemajor.net/"], [368, "2017-09-30T20:40:01Z", [0.0], ""], [53, "2017-09-30T00:34:36Z", [0.35], ""], [691, "2017-09-29T21:01:33Z", [0.6], ""], [368, "2017-09-29T18:17:20Z", [0.0], ""], [29591, "2017-09-29T10:38:45Z", [0.54], "Dropping forecast due to 3 months remaining.  \u201cDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Development Cooperation, Alexander De Croo, announced that Belgium will double its investment in humanitarian innovation next year.

The humanitarian system should therefore focus on uses in natural disasters and early recovery settings.\n\u2022 To tap into the growing interest in UAVs, particularly in technical communities, humanitarian organizations should engage in networks that promote good practices and guidance, and that can serve as a source of surge capacity.\n\u2022 Despite their potential to enhance humanitarian operations, more research and evidence is needed to identify the comparative advantages of using UAVs. More research is needed on in- tegrating aerial observation and data collection into needs and damage assessments, search and rescue, and other humanitarian functions.\nhttps://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/Unmanned%20Aerial%20Vehicles%20in%20Humanitarian%20Response%20OCHA%20July%202014.pdf\n_________________________________\nCOMMENTS:  The usefulness of the UAV is undeniable; Interest is building in the use of UAVs to assist in search and rescue, particularly when equipped with infrared, or other specialty cameras. For example, the European Union is fund- ing ICARUS, a research project to develop unmanned search and rescue tools to assist human teams. To be useful, the UAVs and trained sta  must be available within 24-48 hours of a sudden-onset disaster. In addition these technical approaches must be integrated into the protocols for rescue teams, agreements for importing dis- aster response equipment, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) guidelines and other areas of policy.\nBUT there are challenges to an effective use of UAV. The biggest challenges to expanding the use of UAVs are legal and regulatory. In the OECD, most countries are just developing legal guidance for the commercial or civilian use of UAVs. Many countries in the global South, particularly those with large humanitarian caseloads, may have very little regulation at all. \nIn the U.S., commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) licenses were granted on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the FAA.27 Similar restrictions exist in the UK and EU.28 Many countries where humanitarians are working do not yet have legal frameworks, meaning that use of UAVs will probably need to be cleared on an ad hoc basis with local and national authorities. To ensure long-term acceptance of these tools it will be critical that humanitarians comply with all host country regulations and develop appropriate agreements with regulators. A particular issue is interference with traditional air tra ic: in many countries it is illegal to fly anything within 5km of a commercial airport. As humanitar- ian operations o en center around emergency airports and logistics hubs, these restrictions are of particular concern.\nOther than the above there are also issues of:\nEthical procurement and partnerships\nPrivacy and data protection\nTransparency, informed consent and community engagement\n*** Ironing out all these issues takes time. While, like the consensus I do think it will be the thing of the future, this Q may close before all issues are solved.\n"], [35425, "2017-05-24T13:49:26Z", [0.9], "It seems inevitable that this will be a useful resource to take advantage of.

The foundation also is working with UNICEF on the rollout of Visibility for Vaccines (ViVa), a cutting-edge tracking system that enables early identification of potential stock outs and overstocks of vaccines. ViVa will help global communities ensure supply of life-saving vaccines by providing alerts of critical shortage and overstock situations and allowing for corrective actions.\" Yahoo, April 23, '9 incredible ways we're using drones for social good': https://www.yahoo.com/tech/9-incredible-ways-apos-using-145141619.html\nClips from Yahoo article:\n\"1. Humanitarian aid\nUnmanned aerial vehicles have a proven track record of being useful in disaster relief efforts. Drones helped aid organizations identify areas of need in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, locate mines displaced by the massive Balkan floods in 2014, and document the aftermath of the Nepal earthquake in 2015.\nNow, companies are testing to see how drones can regularly deliver humanitarian aid, rather than just inform NGOs where to go.\nSan Francisco-based Otherlab recently launched the world's most advanced industrial paper airplanes to do just that. The APSARA glider is made of biodegradable materials, and can carry more than two pounds of lifesaving supplies, such as blood and vaccines. When dropped out of a cargo airplane, the drones' interior tech helps them steer themselves in a spiral motion to a designated location using GPS and autopilot. It can land within a 33-foot radius of its intended destination.\nAnother project wants survivors of natural disasters to get their aid and eat it, too. Windhorse Aerospace created an inexpensive prototype called Pouncer, whose wings are packed with food. The protective covers surrounding the food can double as shelter, while the the drone's plywood frame can be used as firewood.\nIt can be extremely difficult (and even dangerous) for aid workers to get to people in hard-to-reach areas, whether it's a rural region of a developing nation, or a country plagued by conflict. But if you cut humans out of the equation, the seemingly insurmountable task gets a little easier.\" Affirming forecast."], [368, "2017-04-29T19:10:07Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-29T12:38:38Z", [0.92], ""], [1624, "2017-04-29T08:58:44Z", [0.9], ""], [368, "2017-04-28T19:44:34Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-28T14:58:44Z", [0.92], ""], [32100, "2017-04-28T12:33:54Z", [0.95], ""], [34509, "2017-04-28T08:45:22Z", [1.0], ""], [34250, "2017-04-28T04:55:46Z", [0.25], ""], [691, "2017-04-27T19:34:30Z", [0.92], ""], [29591, "2017-04-27T18:46:56Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-27T12:55:44Z", [0.95], ""], [35115, "2017-04-26T19:54:43Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-26T19:31:14Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-25T18:04:16Z", [0.95], ""], [34725, "2017-04-25T09:52:17Z", [0.92], ""], [35033, "2017-04-25T07:21:46Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-24T21:55:11Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-24T14:59:34Z", [0.92], ""], [368, "2017-04-23T14:45:57Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-23T14:00:56Z", [0.92], ""], [368, "2017-04-22T21:38:24Z", [0.95], ""], [35057, "2017-04-22T16:45:44Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-21T18:40:11Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-20T21:41:08Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-20T19:27:01Z", [0.92], ""], [32521, "2017-04-20T15:54:06Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-19T19:01:16Z", [0.92], ""], [368, "2017-04-19T19:01:10Z", [0.95], ""], [411, "2017-04-19T16:01:14Z", [0.95], ""], [35013, "2017-04-18T20:53:16Z", [0.9], ""], [368, "2017-04-18T19:37:34Z", [0.95], ""], [29591, "2017-04-18T18:49:09Z", [0.95], ""], [368, "2017-04-17T20:27:41Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-17T11:51:01Z", [0.9], ""], [755, "2017-04-16T22:01:37Z", [0.9], "Affirming forecast for the passage of time."], [368, "2017-04-16T19:44:32Z", [0.95], ""], [34509, "2017-04-16T10:46:05Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-15T21:04:21Z", [0.95], ""], [1333, "2017-04-15T18:23:03Z", [0.85], ""], [34870, "2017-04-15T09:10:15Z", [0.23], ""], [691, "2017-04-15T02:06:20Z", [0.9], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T17:30:58Z", [0.95], ""], [1993, "2017-04-14T15:53:37Z", [0.83], ""], [368, "2017-04-14T03:33:25Z", [0.95], ""], [38, "2017-04-13T22:23:29Z", [0.94], ""], [691, "2017-04-13T12:23:22Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2017-04-12T20:09:24Z", [0.91], ""], [368, "2017-04-12T20:03:37Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-04-12T01:02:17Z", [0.91], ""], [368, "2017-04-11T19:09:31Z", [0.95], ""], [877, "2017-04-11T14:29:53Z", [1.0], ""], [368, "2017-04-11T04:02:42Z", [0.95], ""], [26242, "2017-04-11T02:36:43Z", [0.9], ""], [3225, "2017-04-10T18:44:02Z", [0.9], ""], [34757, "2017-04-10T10:40:00Z", [0.9], ""], [755, "2017-04-10T01:14:29Z", [0.9], "NewsWorks, April 7, 'Cape May County to test how drones can aid post-disaster communications': http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/down-the-shore/102931-cape-may-county-to-test-how-drones-can-aid-post-disaster-communications-\nClips from article:\n\"Officials say the upcoming flight campaign will build on successful drone exercises held last year at the county airport, including using the aerial devices for similar communication provisions and surveying critical infrastructure. \nAlso last year, Flirtey, a drone delivery service, conducted test flights to help determine whether drones can be used to carry human medical samples to and from areas during major natural disasters.

These included parachute drops, drone flights and edible drones. \nDiscussions had been ongoing for months and had been \u201cmired in disagreements between government agencies, the reluctance of the military to get involved and concern among officials that flying in aid without permission from the Damascus regime and its allies could hamper conventional humanitarian deliveries\u201d  Types of humanitarian aid deliveries that had been discussed at meetings included:\n1) Convoys with diplomats from western and Arab countries, though this would still need to go through the same approvals as UN convoys and would essentially suffer the same fate of not getting through. \n2) \u201cTraditional military air drops would have to be carried out at such high altitude, to avoid anti-aircraft missiles, that they would be worse than useless\u201d  \u201cCommercially made drones discussed at the UK embassy meeting could carry payloads of 2 - 50kg. For use in conflict zones, like Syria, they could be programmed to randomise flight paths, altering altitude and direction in unpredictable ways so they would be harder to shoot down. The guidance circuitry could also self-destruct in the event of a crash, so it could not be used as a weapon if it fell into the wrong hands.\"  There was \u201cstrong interest from some parts of the US and UK governments in a large-scale drone airlift, but there are still significant obstacles\u201d.

(1) The intended payload of 'humanitarian aid' means a UAV will need to be big and powerful enough to carry the weight of a package worthy of being delivered at a distance. There are a variety of commercial drones available that could carry small to medium payloads, such as medical supplies, as has been mentioned by others here. However, most UAVs on the market are not designed/suitable for more than camerawork or very light cargo. Small doses of supplies that take several hours to deliver, while lifesaving, might not be the most efficient way to assist those in a conflict zone. Prospective financiers of such an enterprise might be tempted by more efficient ways to spend their money. For example, General Atomics' Angel One has been available to deliver large quantities of aid since at least November 2016, but no NGO has put up the money to use the vehicle. Further, heavier aid such as food or water quickly narrows the field of capable UAV systems. (2) Military organizations around the world are best positioned to have the type of UAV technology required to transport the quantities of aid that would make a difference in a conflict zone. The question specifies the user be an NGO, several of which are indeed exploring use of UAVs for aid purposes. However, these efforts are not plentiful. In situations where airdrop is deemed the best method for delivering humanitarian aid, large military cargo aircraft are used. Also, while airdropping cargo is expensive, military budgets are generally better able to absorb such costs, vis a vis an NGO. (3) Delivery to a conflict zone necessitates long flight distances and high altitudes if the UAV is to avoid being intercepted, which is a risk where aggressors may want to capture an expensive piece of equipment they can re-purpose, maintain the political pressure created by a subjected civilian population, etc. Most organizations that are exploring UAV-delivered cargo are not designing their vehicles to these constraints. For example, Zipline and Matternet are targeted at covering the \"last mile\" of rural deliveries in Africa; Amazon, UPS, etc are planning on (at least initially) peaceful metropolitan service areas; other services in disaster relief situations are focused on high frequency deliveries over shorter distances (see National link). Summary: NGO UAVs are likely to target a niche outside of high volume airdrops, which are currently the purview of military aircraft. As such, the payload needs to be sufficiently high value in order to make the cost/benefit of the required flight profile worthwhile. The technology is advancing, and its costs will continue to decrease, but not as rapidly as if there were more players in this arena designing to the unique constraints of operating in a conflict zone (as opposed to the plethora of hobby UAV options). However, the severe need to be served and the positive publicity that would come from an NGO delivering aid to a conflict zone continue to keep the idea in play. The number of \"conflict zones\" also factor in to this forecast. I think this will happen eventually, but probably not this year. I will reevaluate towards the end of the summer.

Also, we want to move beyond just blood delivery and include other essential and lifesaving medicines. In the next few years, we expect to be able to make on-demand deliveries to community health workers who travel from village to village (as long as that worker has a smartphone).\" What are the biggest challenges in terms of technology?\nJustin: \"Technology is actually not our biggest challenge. We\u2019ve built an autonomous aircraft from scratch that can deliver medical products to locations 75km away. But creating the vehicles are only a fraction of our work. Zipline has set up a national drone delivery service that integrates a public health supply chain and built the infrastructure and equipment necessary to do a 50-150 flights per day.\" Conclusion: They can already do it but need direct request from an international organization and/or the affected country.

But I don\u2019t think it will become public knowledge on the day that it happens.  For low flying drones its pretty easy to track the general direction they are coming from so I don\u2019t see how using a drone to transport high value/low volume cargo will not compromise the safety of those piloting/launching the drone and those that the delivery is intended for. The main issue is that there are no regulations that are universally agreed. As an example, Afghanistan only permits drones to fly in daylight hours (uavsystemsinternational.com) and flying in Nigeria requires a government permit (ncaa.gov.ng).  There is no doubt that the technology is there for cargo drones and case studies show that it works. For example, UPS successfully delivered a package, launching the drone from the top of the UPS van on Friday 24th February 2017, the case study given by @Raahul_Kumar on Zipline in Rwanda and Medicins Sans Fronti\u00e8rs/ Matternet collaboration on delivering medicine supplies in rural parts of Papua New Guinea in 2014 (drones.fsd.ch/en/drones-in-humanitarian-action). Only one case study on cargo drones used in the \u201cDrones in humanitarian action: A guide to the use of airborne system in humanitarian crises\u201d was located in a conflict zone. The Syrian Airlift Project was set up in 2014 with the sole purpose of delivering humanitarian aid from Turkey to besieged civilians in Syria - the project dissolved in December 2015 due to lack of sponsorship. However, one of the main issues that the project came up against was legislation, which the aforementioned guide also raised. I think the concept of using drones to deliver aid is a brilliant idea, given the lives it could help and save - but using drones in a conflict zone is not comparable to using them for disaster relief. The issue with running an operation like Zipline in a conflict zone - where they have 15 drones making 150 deliveries each day - is that by having 15 drones flying in what eventually would be a repetitive flight path would draw too much attention from hostile groups/organisations.
