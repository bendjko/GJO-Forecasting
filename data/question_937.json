THIS QUESTION CLOSES ONE YEAR BEFORE IT RESOLVES. (EDIT: Not any more). Although I'm not changing my forecast from my initial guess, I want to look into this further because I know nothing about this situation. So I'm making some summary notes here, all sourced from Wikipedia. Please comment if you spot any mistakes. KOSOVO\nThe Republic of Kosovo, capital Pristina, population about 2m, currency is the Euro. It is bounded by Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. It declared independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008 but Serbia continues to claim that Kosovo remains part of Serbian territory and is blocking Kosovo's application to join the UN. It is a partially recognised state, being recognised by 111 UN countries but not by five of the 28 EU member states (Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania, and Greece) or by Serbia, Russia, or China. SERBIA\nSerbia, capital Belgrade, population about 7m (excluding Kosovo), currency is the Serbian dinar. Serbia is a fully recognised state. Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 became the 5th President of Serbia on 31 May 2017, appointing Ana Brnabi\u0107 to replace him as Prime Minister, a post which he had held since 27 April 2014. Vu\u010di\u0107 has been central to negotiations on Serbia\u2019s bid for EU accession. EUROPEAN UNION\nThe EU formally recognises Serbia, but not Kosovo. The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 8 July 2010 calling on all member states to recognise Kosovo. On 6 February 2018, the European Commission published its expansion plan to cover up to six Western Balkan countries: Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. Since 2007 the EU has maintained a permanent force of 2,000 personnel (including police officers, four anti-riot units, prosecutors and judges) in Kosovo. The level of EU influence in Kosovo has led some to term it an EU protectorate. INITIAL THOUGHTS\nSerbian President Vu\u010di\u0107 wants EU accession. The EU will not allow that until relations between Serbia and Kosovo are normalised. Kosovo is extremely unlikely to agree to be part of Serbia, which means that in order to gain EU accession, Serbia must formally recognise Kosovo. TODO\n1. Develop a baseline case.\n2. Look into Serbian politics to determine how likely Serbia is to agree to recognise Kosovo. ONGOING EDITS\n14 Dec 2018: Kosovo votes to create an army. Serbia and Russia not happy about it.

In Serbia and Kosovo, there are heavily nationalistic ideals which exacerbates tensions. This is especially true in places where there are still Serb villages in Kosovo, and people in Kosovo who identify as Serbs. Instead of creating programs that help to assimilate these populations and grow acceptance, they are seeking to redraw country border lines. This discussion does not signify a move towards normalization, but rather a discussion that could lead to increased tensions. Russia also has very close economic ties with Serbia, as they supply their oil, as well as cultural and religious ones. This aspect of their relations could deter Serbia from reaching a normalization, especially given that both Serbia and Russia refuse to recognize Kosovo as a country. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-18/russia-s-embrace-sows-total-confusion-for-serbia-s-eu-hopes https://wapo.st/2RoslQD?tid=ss_mail&utm_term=.9bfe4f5fb24d https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/2018/10/18/getting-agreement-serbia-kosovo/"], [82, "2018-10-19T03:54:34Z", [0.1], ""], [34725, "2018-10-18T07:00:47Z", [0.09], ""], [2965, "2018-10-16T23:08:14Z", [0.04], "extremely unlikely but give a year\nlot can change."], [691, "2018-10-16T12:19:34Z", [0.08], ""], [34725, "2018-10-16T09:01:45Z", [0.12], ""], [82, "2018-10-15T21:24:44Z", [0.15], ""], [3316, "2018-10-14T20:17:33Z", [1.0], ""], [1333, "2018-10-14T18:29:01Z", [0.11], ""], [3152, "2018-10-14T17:48:03Z", [0.25], ""], [19801, "2018-10-14T07:27:49Z", [0.01], "http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/bg/press-room/20181009IPR15401/western-balkans-meps-take-stock-of-2018-progress"], [691, "2018-10-12T21:10:42Z", [0.08], ""], [2965, "2018-10-12T13:59:59Z", [0.02], ""], [23006, "2018-10-12T01:35:21Z", [0.12], ""], [15265, "2018-10-09T21:29:43Z", [0.2], ""], [28414, "2018-10-08T10:00:33Z", [0.1], "\u201cI am aware that the dialogue is very challenging.

The EU has also made the balkans a priority this year during the Bulgarian and Austrian presidencies, but this orientation may not outlive the Austrian presidency. While the Balkans have seen major developments over the last 12 months, for example Macedonia and Greece cooperating over the name change, this may not domino into the wider region.

Ethnic tensions are very high as Serbian officials and the general Serbian population refuse to acknowledge Kosovo as a sovereign nation. It\u2019s been over 10 years since Kosovo declared independence and almost 20 years since the end of the War in Kosovo and there has been little success in normalization of the relationship between the two countries. Meetings that have thus far been planned have either been canceled or ended with little to no progress. The EU membership has been a good incentive for the two countries to begin working together, but current solutions that are being thrown around include a land swap, which has faced criticism from the international community as well as people in the region. If they continue with this solution at the rate they currently are, there is a very low chance that normalization will occur, however, if other solutions are proposed, and the two come to terms with the past, there is a chance for better success.
