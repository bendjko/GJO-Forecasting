This might change now that he is in a non-executive role and voting power of his shares have been reduced.\n- One of the new co-CEOs (Gunningham) is said to have had a positive, mediating impact on Neumann and the course of the company, \"to the extent some employees said they referred to him as \u201cshadow CEO\u201d and \u201cthe adult in the room\u201d\" [1] - having Gunningham in the top job might help restore some confidence by investors, and could lead WeWork to decide to push ahead with the IPO without hiring a new, outside CEO first (see below).\n- This hasn't really changed with Neumann stepping down, but without an IPO, WeWork puts a loan package in jeopardy that is a much needed cash injection to keep its operations going [3].  Arguments for less likely:\n- The new co-CEOs are perceived as close to Neumann, so it might take bringing in an outside CEO to increase investor confidence prior to an IPO. If they are going to look for a new CEO, this will take time and makes a delay of the IPO until next year more likely.\n- Even if WeWork had already planned the marketing and strategy around the IPO, bringing in new leadership almost always leads to some ramp up time and adjustments, making a delay more likely.\n- There seem to be plans to cut costs by focusing on the core business and lay-offs [4], with the goal of making the company more attractive to investors. Again, implementing these changes will take time. I am going to increase no IPO, but not as far as some other forecasters and the crowd (currently at 92%).

This competitor (IWG) also has a rev/sq ft that\u2019s about 23% higher than WeWork.  These concerns seems to be increasing the risk that WeWork puts off its IPO for this year until it can fully address self-dealing among execs and other governance issues. On the other hand, growing recession risks could further jeopardize a company that makes its money by borrowing long term and lending short term.  Investopedia had a good article on what drives IPO valuations:\n- demand: while short term leases for office space is likely to be in demand, work from home capabilities and growth of smaller US cities will likely keep workers away from expensive leases in populous cities. In terms of demand for shares of the business, I don\u2019t think WeWorks model is sustainable in an economic downturn.  - Industry Comps: closest competition is valued at a measly $3.7bn -Growth Prospects: subjective, but it seems like this might be the upside. Classification as a tech company could allow WeWork to move with broader indices and possibly allow it to stay at a higher valuation longer.  - Good story: WeWork had this, but it is deteriorating quickly.  All in - I think the IPO gets slashed to $20bn, but it is almost equally likely that it will be postponed."], [30477, "2019-09-09T13:33:38Z", [0.02, 0.55, 0.27, 0.06, 0.1], ""], [78328, "2019-09-09T13:30:36Z", [0.0, 0.85, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15], ""], [77830, "2019-09-09T05:57:16Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1], ""], [61367, "2019-09-09T05:21:28Z", [0.0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.0, 0.35], ""], [1333, "2019-09-09T00:18:13Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.04, 0.01, 0.45], ""], [1333, "2019-09-08T23:56:13Z", [0.3, 0.15, 0.04, 0.01, 0.5], ""], [5018, "2019-09-08T23:50:33Z", [0.25, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5], ""], [4962, "2019-09-08T21:22:40Z", [0.02, 0.6, 0.2, 0.01, 0.17], ""], [12879, "2019-09-08T18:24:36Z", [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [27692, "2019-09-08T17:26:02Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.45, 0.1, 0.05], "Bloomberg TV is discussing this issues extensively.
