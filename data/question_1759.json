However, Covid is starting to spike in what might be a second wave, and the economy is slowing.  Trump seems to understand the severity of the need for stimulus and is panicked since he cannot move enough senate Republicans to get it passed.  The most recent 538 polls average Purdue with a 2% lead since September 27.  The most recent polls have him a bit higher, except for one that has Ossoff +1 percent.    There are advantages to being an incumbent.   Yet, I think Ossoff will gain at a minimum 1 percent and a maximum 5 percent in the next few weeks.  So, lets say Purdue is + 3 right now.  Then subtract 3 for the average of the effects of coronavirus and the collapsing economy.  That makes it almost dead even.  I will still add a point for the incumbency.  So 60/40 for Purdue.   This may change to 40/60  Purdue (thus favoring Ossoff) in the next week if the unemployment new claims start rising again -- I think they will at least as bad as last week--  and, coronavirus starts to spike nationwide.  It could be 30/70 in favor of Ossoff if the coronavirus numbers start rising in Georgia.
