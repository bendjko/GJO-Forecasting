Russian officials also called the restrictions of the treaty unsuitable for Russia given the strategic situation in Asia and because the USA intended to violate the treaty by placing missile launchers in Poland and Romania.[37] In 2017, American officials said Russia had deployed the prohibited SSC-8 cruise missile.[34] Missiles like the SSC-8 are considered destabilizing, as they can deliver a nuclear strike in less than 10 minutes from launch.[38] In 2018 the US started R&D on a U.S. missile to be deployed if the treaty falls apart; the treaty bans manufacture but not R&D.[39] Russia publicly considered US drones to be a violation of the treaty.[40][41]\"\"\" Okay, Russia wants to withdraw due to issues with China and already breached some conditions.

This announcement not only makes it clear that Russia does not intend abide by the INF treaty, but also acts as further evidence of aggression. Moreover, the recent assassination attempt by nerve agent in Great Britain is thought to be ordered by the Putin Administration and resulted in the expelling of 23 Russian diplomats in the UK, and 60 Russian diplomat in the US, and other allies are following suit. While this does not directly relate to the nuclear treaty, the rapidly increasing tensions is a good indication that either the United States or the Russian Federation will withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Treaty.

In short, similar as with treaties regarding chemical weapons, uranium, and many more, USA did not care to obey by the contracts it has signed. NATO expanded towards Russia, another example. For US it is not really an issue, rather for the Europeans. For Russia, it does obey to all treaties it has committed itself to, and obviously would prefer to limit the intermediate range rockets.

Putin most likely used this announcement as chest beating for local consumption to help him win the election.  Part of the the difficulty here is that the US has defensive weapons against certain kinds of missiles.  Putin uses his new weapon as a negotiating tool, for example for having missile defensive weapons removed from former Soviet satellite countries. But he is probably beyond that point in deployment.  Putin feels free to incrementally develop these weapons and get scolded on a recurring basis, but nothing happens. The US could decide at some point to scrap the agreement as retaliation against some Putin move, but seems unlikely to remove a program that does provide some restraint on Putin. Putin, on the other hand, could decide to punish the US for some grievance, and end the agreement. Both risk starting an arms race for this type of weapon.

Despite the recent perceived violations by Russia in its testing of the 9M729, it is still not a substantial attack for the treaty and there are still options left to bring Russia back into compliance. Among the most important of these options is the Special Verification Commission. Recently, Russia has criticized the United States  in its deployment of the Aegis Ashore launchers, by stating that the United States was in breach of the treaty as the launchers could carry prohibited missiles. The Commission could work by allowing inspectors to view both weapons and determine their capabilities, which would be a great sign of mutual respect. In addition, the US could pressure its allies into ensuring that the INF treaty remains a top priority on their agenda in their discussions with delegates of Russia. In summation, long term successful treaties are usually held until all options are exhausted, and the INF treaty should be no different as both sides have options for resolving disputes.

It did not serve to fully eliminate the ability of either the US or Russia to strike any given target on the planet with some form of nuclear weapon. Long range ICBMs, sea-based vehicles, and strategic bombers could still allow for this capability. As such the value in the INF was largely as a symbolic agreement continuing a (somewhat disingenuous) trend toward disarmament as well as a cost saving measure for both parties. If one is faced with evaluating the likelihood of either party suspending the agreement, the first step is to assess what would be gained. In my estimation, just as the value in entering it was largely symbolic, the main possibilities for leaving it would also be based in some type of symbolism. The United States has a president and congress who may increasingly find themselves in a position where appearing to be strong in opposition to Russia on anything will be politically useful. Additionally, Russia has grown increasingly brazen in its willingness to break international agreements and understandings without any realistic expectation of rebuke. As such a US suspension of the INF could serve as a means for the US administration/congress to  appear to be anti-Russia and publicly admonish Russian aggressive behavior in context that is not likely to be particularly impactful. \nBoth have implemented programs that are fundamental violations of the INF, if not in its wording in its spirit. Given that there has, to this point, been no repudiation for these violations, it is hard to see that there is any great strategic value in leaving the INF. For this reason as well as the fact that most observers (in the US particularly) don't rate the INF high on their list of important international agreements, making it weak as a symbolic token of defiance against Russia make it less likely to be used in this manner. The wild card nature of President Trump forces one to increase any assessment of what is remotely possible though which is why I made this outcome as likely as I did.

Also, Trump may very well want to withdraw from the treaty, as he has already declared his intention to withdraw from other landmark treaties. And Republicans are not pushing back. So I can definitely see potential for Trump (who said in the SOTU, \"we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal\") to use the Russia situation to withdraw from the INF.  This could well be something Putin wants.  Once the US is out, Russia is easily out at well. Both countries would then rebuild intermediate and short-range missiles -- weapons that China and North Korea have -- and claim that whatever they are doing is for deterrence.

The utility of the INF Treaty as it currently exists: missile technology has advanced significantly since 1987 such that the subsection of weapons it was designed to prohibit (approximately 500-1000km) can now be launched by other means not explicitly covered by the INF treaty - namely by sea. If the current canvas of missile capabilities can be launched in ways that bypass the INF treaty, one would then have to consider the principle strength of the INF Treaty to be the fact that it reflects a moment of solidarity in time rather than a functional agreement that limits certain types of missiles.  2. Principles of plausible deniability: It is likely that Russia and the United States accept a certain amount of non-compliance with arms treaties because providing demonstrable proof of the existence of arms that violate the treaty would possibly also reveal sources and methods of intelligence collection both nations would prefer to preserve. This implies that the treaty itself could be rotten at its core, which further reinforces the idea that the principle strength of the treaty is its political significance.  3. The results of the Russian collusion investigation in the United States. Should the Robert Mueller investigation progress or escalate to a point of concluding that there was collusion between the Trump Administration and the Kremlin, it's possible that the Trump Administration would publicly walk away from the agreement as a method of distancing itself from Russia.  If one assumes that the INF Treaty is more of a \"dinosaur\" in the current age of weapon technology, then its strength is in its political weight. While heavy, there are reasonable futures where it could become collateral in a political effort to publicly signal separation between the US from Russia.
