Of the 314 alerts published under the URL at the end of the question since 2005, only 17 (5.5%) contained the word \u201cfamine\u201d and referred to one or more countries directly. Two more alerts containing the word \"famine\" without referring to any country specifically. Notably, 8 of these alerts have been issued in the past 12 months - 6 in December/January 2016 and 2 in May/June 2017  (one alert from Dec 2016 referred to Yemen directly). It is not entirely clear to me why alerts appear to be clustered around certain dates, but I suspect that has to do with data availability and FEWS reporting behavior. If this was the case, the probability that a relevant alert will be issued before the end of October would be quite low. On the other hand, the outlook for Yemen for October 2017 to January 2018 is worse than for the previous months, which could increase the probability that FEWS issues an alert relevant to the question.

While this should not be the case according to FEWS (\"at current funding and assistance levels, WFP expects to continue providing assistance through October 2017\"), I estimate that even if supply was disrupted,  it would take FEWS at least several days to assess the situation and  publish the alert.

In a worst-case scenario, significant declines in commercial imports below requirement levels and conflict that cuts populations off from trade and humanitarian assistance for an extended period could drive food security outcomes in line with Famine (IPC Phase 5). \nLarge-scale humanitarian assistance continues to play an important role in reducing the severity of acute food insecurity outcomes in Yemen. In August 2017, WFP distributed in-kind and voucher assistance to approximately 7 million people. At current funding and assistance levels, WFP expects to continue providing assistance through October 2017. After October, a partial pipeline break is expected to result in the provision of wheat-only distributions through December 2017.\nField reports suggest the floating of the Yemeni Rial in mid-August has not yet resulted in major market disruptions or unexpected inflation. Field reports suggest this is at least partially due to the fact that many traders have been using the unofficial market exchange rate in their transactions for an extended period prior to the floating of the currency.\nFleetMon ship tracking data suggest the number of bulk carriers, which typically transport most staple cereals, that have arrived into Al Hudaydah, Salif, Aden, and Al Mukalla ports sharply decreased in August. Nevertheless, the total number of bulk carrier arrivals in 2017 remains higher than in 2014. Moreoever, according to UNVIM, the monthly June to August average of food imports in 2017 is 10 percent higher than during the same time in 2016. Recent WFP reporting also suggests overall supply of major food commodities has improved on most markets in recent months.\nThe cholera outbreak continues in all of Yemen\u2019s governorates except Socotra, with approximately 738,719 suspected cases identified and 2,118 deaths reported between April 27 and September 25, 2017.

Just how much more dire the situation can become may be known by the end of September, according to medical and relief experts, when seasonal rains in some of the afflicted nations make meager roads impassible, and further spread the water-born disease. The same seasonal rains also bring rising incidences of other forms of watery diarrhea, as well as malaria, and there are reports of sporadic outbreaks of meningitis and measles. The additional health hazards are placing further heavy strain on humanitarian resources that are already deeply inadequate to the massive challenge of aiding at least 30 million people suffering in and around the stricken countries with some 20 million\u2014figures vary\u2014in the direst need of assistance. Moreover, the kind of money that the U.N. is asking international donors to provide is not rolling in. Of some $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance, including funding for health emergencies, that the U.N. has asked for the four stricken countries, so far only about $3.45 billion  has materialized, or only about 53 percent of the funding appeal. The U.S. share of the funding so far is about $1.1 billion, or nearly a third of the money so far on the table. Another problem: dealing with the disease epidemics seems beyond the capacity available to the United Nations\u2019 World Health Organization (WHO), which failed abysmally three years ago to deal rapidly with West Africa\u2019s deadly Ebola crisis, in part because of its close ties with governments that sought to downplay the disaster. There is no doubt that WHO is trying hard to stay in front of the disease crisis, and in some areas\u2014Somalia and South Sudan\u2014has claimed that the cholera epidemic is slowing down, as one of its websites puts it, \u201cthanks to timely interventions by WHO, national health authorities and health partners.\u201d But other health workers in the stricken regions are less optimistic, and in some cases\u2014South Sudan, for one\u2014argue that the numbers of stricken are still badly underestimated. Moreover, in regions that are wracked with internal conflict, and government health facilities are in an advanced state of collapse, WHO\u2019s abilities are starkly limited, and even shrinking, due to its ties with stricken local governments. \u201cWHO is inherently unable to bring major outbreaks under control in places where there is violence, conflict and state instability and insecurity,\u201d observes Lawrence Gostin, professor of medicine at Georgetown University and onetime member of the WHO Director-General\u2019s Advisory Committee on Reforming the World Health Organization. \u201cWHO is highly dependent on national health authorities, and where there i a vacuum of power in local government, or when those governments are corrupt and even cause the health hazards, WHO simply doesn\u2019t have the ability to end fast-moving epidemics. WHO also relies on strong national health systems, and these health systems are weak, fragmented or non existent in conflict zones and in places where refugees congregate.\u201d \u201cIt is probably unrealistic to believe that WHO has the political and economic power to be highly effective,\u201d continued Gostin. \u201cIn the case of cholera, it has not been able to make a difference in war-torn countries.\u201d WHO, of course, argues otherwise. Nonetheless, a bad situation is fast becoming worse. The cholera crisis in Yemen, recognized as the world\u2019s worst single-country outbreak, has some 630,000 cases so far, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Health Organization (WHO), with about 2,000 dead as a result.\"\nIn a gloomy report to the U.N. Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s top refugee official, Stephen O\u2019Brien, declared that \u201cwe are seeing accelerating institutional collapse in Yemen, which is also putting considerable additional pressure on the response.\u201d Only 45 per cent of national health facilities were fully functioning\u2014a nebulous standard\u2014he declared and \u201csanitation systems have mostly ground to a halt.\u201d Beyond those numbers is the much bigger disaster of some 2.9 million Yemeni refugees and 17 million people labeled as \u201cfood insecure\u201d by the U.N., including 7 million at risk of famine. They are  bearing the overall brunt of a two-year civil war between Iran-backed Houthi forces and the forces of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, backed by a Saudi Arabia-led coalition that has had U.S. intelligence and logistical support. \u201cWe are in a super-crisis,\u201d said Caroline Seguin, deputy program manager for the medical group Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres, a non-government organization that operates outside the U.N. health umbrella.\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/15/cholera-aid-shortfalls-plague-desperate-refugees-conflict.html\nregardless of FEWS NET \nthe Economist blog  discussed the UN definition not FEWS NET but there is a poltical dimension.\nToday  Pres Trump met with the US and Saudi backed leader what does this portend? \nBut I add it here as  additional objective criteria:\n\"IN FEBRUARY the United Nations made the first formal declaration of famine since 2011. Parts of South Sudan, the world\u2019s newest country, are now officially in a state of famine. The UN says that some 20m people are also at risk of famine in Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), part of USAID, America\u2019s aid agency, 70m people worldwide will need emergency food aid this year; the highest level in decades. The declaration has galvanised aid agencies, which are frantically fundraising to be able to meet multiple crises at once. But what constitutes a famine?  In the past, writes Alex de Waal, a veteran researcher of famines, \u201ca rookie aid worker or journalist, a politically partisan advocate\u2014or a team of seasoned nutritionists and humanitarian professionals\u2014could use the word \u2018famine\u2019 as they wished.\u201d But these days, it tends to have a technical definition. The United Nations uses the \u201cIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification\u201d, or just the IPC scale. This system is based on geographical areas and places them into one of five categories, from minimal (where most people can get enough food without aid, but some are having to, for example, sell their livestock to survive) all the way through to full famine (where, even with what humanitarian assistance is available, a large number of people are starving to death). The idea of the IPC scale, which was developed in 2004, is to make famine technocratic. For a region to be declared in IPC phase five\u2014full famine\u2014it has to meet certain criteria, detailed in an extensive 125-page manual. For example, the overall death rate due to lack of food must be over two per population of 10,000 per day, and the death rate for children under the age of five (who are most vulnerable to food shortage) must be over four per 10,000 per day. What this means is that data must be gathered extensively. In countries affected by severe food insecurity, UN agencies such as the World Food Programme and Unicef conduct \u201csmart\u201d surveys, going house to house, weighing children and asking about food intake and deaths in the family. In practice however, it is not so scientific as it seems. Interpreting data is difficult: for example, any specific count of \u201chunger-related\u201d deaths can be questioned. And more importantly, collecting data in countries where people are starving is difficult, because they are often at war. So where fresh data are missing, experts use proxies, such as the number of malnourished children arriving at clinics, to try to extrapolate what the real figure is. That makes declarations of famine more political than they might appear. South Sudan may well have been in famine last year, Mr de Waal writes, but a declaration was resisted before now, partly by a South Sudanese government official sitting on the IPC body.\"\nhttps://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/04/economist-explains-0 and today the Economist unloaded on USAID \n\"Doing good well\nWhy America\u2019s overseas aid agency needs reform\" Aid programmes are bogged down by a byzantine regulatory structure\nhttps://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/09/doing-good-well\nDemocracy in America\nSep 18th 2017by C.K. | WASHINGTON, DC and what is truly disturbing is this report about Yemen, Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia A leading agronomist observes: \"Yemen erupted into conflict in 2015, when the Houthi tribe rebelled in support of the ousted President Saleh against the new government of President Hadi.

That report period runs from February-September.  90% of Yemen's food supply comes from food imports & the country remains under blockade from land and water (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)). \n This region is predicted to remain at risk, and news indicates that Saudi barricades and delays for humanitarian aid are ongoing and may continue, that 40% of hospitals are down or limited in what they can do to help.  Based on FEWS Net reporting history, a follow up Food Security Report for the Oct-Jan period is typical for at-risk areas.  Historically, October reports for in areas immediately post-harvest tend to be more positive and less dire sounding about risks than the Feb-April status reports.  Unless the situation worsens and the risk of famine increases for Yemen specifically to merit its own report or for the general region of northeast Africa, the headline will probably not include the word \"famine\" and \"Yemen\" specifically and other terms to return focus to level 3 or 4 risk will be used.
