Although Keir is currently polling at a 34% approval rating and the Labour party\u2019s major donor, Unite, has threatened to pull its funding, I do not believe that he will face a formal challenge for leadership before April 4, 2021 (BBC News, 2022) (YouGov, 2022a). There is only one formal way for his position of leader to be challenged and that is by having 20% of the Labour Party\u2019s MPs nominate a contender (Zodgekar & Durrant, 2020). From looking online, I was not able to locate any rumors about anyone planning to challenge Keir in the near future. In my opinion if someone were planning to challenge his role before April 4th there would have to be some trace of a rumor since we are less than a month away from that date, and the challenger has to at least have 20% of the votes from the current MPs. Additionally, when asked if Keir should remain leader of the Labour party, 41% of the people polled stated that he should, which is higher than his approval rating (YouGov, 2022b).

The reason for my prediction is that Starmer\u2019s only threat in holding his position as Labour Party leader would come from the ardent supporters of former MP Corbyn. Corbyn was expelled from the party and has been surrounded by much controversy regarding anti-Semitic remarks. Given Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine this past week, which features a (false) narrative by Russia regarding \u201cde-nazifying Ukraine\u201d (despite its president being Jewish and a descendant of Holocaust survivors), the democratic Western coalition of countries, including the United Kingdom, have solidified into strongly condemning Russia\u2019s unprovoked aggression. Any Labour Party members who previously advocated for Corbyn, who were anti-Starmer, will face an even more difficult task of distancing themselves from a former leader who stands on the wrong side of the public narrative. Starmer is pro-NATO in a political party that is left-leaning and has historically advocated for peace, however the narrative by pro-Corbyn members that NATO has provoked Russia will only bolster Starmer\u2019s public image as an assertive politician advocating for stricter sanctions and actions against Russian oligarchs and Vladimir Putin.

Given that we\u2019re already in early March 2022, in order for the answer to be a yes, the challenge would need to be initiated in relatively short order.  In that case, I would expect to see significant talk around an imminent challenge, however in further research I have not seen that.  The time binding of the question I think significantly limits the probability here.  Also, in looking at the wording of the question, I think it\u2019s important to note that this only asks whether he would \u201cface\u201d a formal challenge in the given time period, not whether he will win an election initiated by a formal challenge or whether he would potentially resign.  That said, in a further look at the polling data on yougov.co.uk it looks as if Sir Starmer\u2019s approval rating has rebounded from lows in early May 2021 (note GJP question initiated August 2021) where only 17% felt he was doing well and 65% felt he was doing poorly.  As of 9 February 2022, 34% reported he was doing well while 49% felt he was doing badly.  In another poll from at the same site from 12 January 2022, 41% felt he should remain as Labour party leader while 27% felt he should stand down.  This shows a reversal from 22 September 2021, where 35% felt Sir Starmer should stand down while just 30% felt he should remain.  Given those trends, if a formal challenge was not issued previously I think it\u2019s unlikely that one would be prior to the 4 April 2022 deadline of this question, especially given the uncertainty internationally right now.

Judging by his performance he will be successful at re-election. He was knighted for his service as Director of Public Prosecutions. A key requirement to become the Labour Party leader is to be nominated by 20% of all Labour Party MPs. According to Institute for Government, Sir Keir won the election for Labour leadership in the 2020 election with 56.2% of all first preference votes (ifg.gov, 2020). During the recent event of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sir Starmer has taken a harsh stance towards the views of any Russian support. Eleven left-wing MPs signed a letter that was critical of NATO expansion. The Labour leader stated that if the MPs didn\u2019t stop their \u201cStop the War\u201d campaign they will lose the next election. Sir Starmer also stated any MPs who attack NATO or involve in \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d with Russian aggression will be kicked out of the party (Forrest, 2022). Sir Starmer's leadership decisions separate him from the competition and make him a strong candidate.  He has a long and successful history of influence.

However, the Labour Party is dissatisfied with Sir Starmer leadership and lack of kept promises (skynews.com).

The political party is gaining much traction as of late as the main opposition party in regards to almost all formal government policies that represent the status quo. Sir Keir Starmer stands in a position to take full advantage of his peers and political opponents' failures while being able to control the narrative. \u201cOpinion polling has suggested for weeks that the government's pain has been Labour's gain. But that poll lead wobbles up and down, and there is no way Labour can be sure it will last. In his recent clashes with Mr Johnson, Sir Keir has undoubtedly profited from not being the other guy, but when it comes to his own party leadership, he is still putting huge efforts into not being the guy that came before him.\u201d He is also doubling down on the conflict in Ukraine by noting \u201cHe told us Labour had always been the party of Nato, pointing out that one of its earliest documents bore the signature of Ernest Bevin, a giant of the Labour movement, as he spoke of his own belief in the Western alliance of countries who would work together to defend themselves.\u201d This coming at a time that other political parties within the UK government are under investigation for campaign contributions involving connections with Russian influence. \u201cThis seems like common sense. So why is it not happening? Perhaps the answer can be found in the Tory party\u2019s accounts. By taking nearly \u00a32m in donations since Boris Johnson took power in 2019, they have become just as hooked on Russian-linked money as any of the worm-tongued servicers of oligarchical wealth.\u201d This investigation stems from the opposition political party's refusal to crack down on illicit money laundering that stems from outside the borders and has ties to the Kremlin. \u201cOver almost 12 years of Tory government, the tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap around the UK, turning London into the \u201cmoney-laundering capital of the world\u201d.\u201d Considering the Ukrainian crisis is one of the top priorities for NATO states in the current world events the Labour Party will likely benefit from the talking points being led by Sir Keir Starmer and will likely not be replaced in the short term while he is making big gains in public opinion on world affairs.

He is probably surrounded by those who are considering his replacement.\nHe is currently angering the left wing by pushing through changes that will give a weighed vote to sitting MP\u2019s as opposed to the general membership that voted in hard left Corbyn.\nThe changes include an uplift to 20% of MP\u2019s required to mount a challenge that translates into a minimum of 40 members.

This is probably indicative as the why The Labour Party has never elected a woman to be leader.\nThere is also Angela Rayner (soft left?), who has possibly alienated some members by her comments concerning the Conservative Party as \u2018 \u2018We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute pile\u2026 of banana republic\u2026 Etonian\u2026 piece of scum\u2026\u2019 which is possibly beyond the pale in civilised debate.\nThis leaves the centre right, one Andy Burnham, currently the Mayor of Greater Manchester.\nHe is charismatic, politically savvy with an extensive history of politics in the UK Labour party, back to the government of Tony Blair.\nHe has indicated that he wants to complete his second term in office as Mayor but is willing to return to Westminster politics if there was a moment where that was right. A big message to the party.\nThere is the possibility of a general election to be called 2023/24 which would suggest the embedding of a new leader sooner rather later.\nGiven all that, I will suggest that the time it takes for the momentum to raise a challenge and the required in-fighting, he is probably safe until 4th April.

The most recent leaders to be challenged were Corbyn, who was challenged in 2016 following the Brexit vote, and Kinnock who was challenged in 1988. Both retained the leadership. It therefore seems unlikely that there will be a challenge. Nonetheless, Keir is not hugely popular. He has yet to really score a meaningful victory that puts a dent in the government - more often than he would have liked he has been with the government on the losing side of an issue. He also has yet to show a path forward that convinces people to vote for Labour, as the recent by-elections have shown.\nThere have already been rumblings of election challenges (Rayner, Butler), although it is not clear whether they would be able to obtain the support of 20% of all labour MPs, let alone have confidence of winning a subsequent leadership vote - Butler may have more of a chance with the leadership vote if she can rally Corbyn voters behind her but may be less likely to have the necessary support with MPs.

According to YouGov they are only the 31st and 35th most popular Labour politicians (including ex-politicians).\nOne thing that is in favour of a challenge before the 4th of April 2022 is that if a challenge is to happen, it is likely to happen around that time. Later than that and a challenger may be better off waiting until after the next general election and possible resignation of Keir. So a potential challenger that believes they have a high probability of winning the next general election in place of Keir should challenge him for the leadership sooner rather than later.

If October's Party conferences don't go as I'm currently forecasting they might (and particularly if Johnson survives intact and stable on his perch for another season) then the probability of a Labour leadership challenge may go up significantly, with the Party feeling that Starmer had his chance but failed to land the body blows and make the public impact needed to destabilize the incumbent Tory dominance in Parliament (despite all the obvious open goals they've offered) [4]. Should this scenario transpire the Labour leadership may feel that now is the right time for a change to give their new man/woman time to make the impact Starmer has failed to before the next election season (which, in this scenario, would seem more likely to be in 2024 to give BoJo and his tame media outlets some time to conduct a reputational regain from his current position). Moving up to 15% from a low starting position based largely on the majority negative polling on Starmer's performance and the fragility of his position in the face of whatever October 2021 will bring.  At this moment I identify the Party conference season and any fallout in November 2021 as a key decision point indicator for this question.

The Corbyn supporting elements will still attempt noisy distractions but their bullet was shot with Corbyn himself and the pragmatic amongst them will not have failed to recognise (at least in private) how incredibly short that bullet fell (or, to extend the metaphor, how it utterly back fired in contributing to the rise of the Clown Prince and his cadre of impeachables). There do not appear to be any eligible moderate challengers from the other wing of the Party either (with Andy Burnham being popular amongst Labour members but not an MP and not likely to be within this question's timeframe [1]). I did note Blair appearing out of the woodwork once again to opine on the Afghan situation [2].  I did wonder if this might be Tony's asymmetric pitch for (in his mind) a glorious return to leadership but this would seem, at this moment, a very unlikely and highly contentious move from the divisive former PM and not something likely to achieve anything for him in the next 8 months. There is always the scenario of a leadership challenge emerging from something in Starmer's woodwork coming out that is devastating to his standing and credibility. Whilst this is in never an impossibility for a UK politician (where it seems you can't be an MP unless there's some form of kompromat that the whips can use on you) it feels that, with the routine (and publicly visible) drumming Starmer was giving Johnson at PMQs this time last year and the clear desperation it was inducing in the Clown Prince at that time, the Tory Party machinery would have spun up and published anything sufficiently damning to see Starmer's departure at that time (Q2 - 3 2020). The worst they seemed to be able to dredge up was something about a Donkey Sanctuary for his mother? [3].  As such, it seems that Starmer is a generally safe character with a generally clean history, making a scandal induced leadership challenge a fairly remote possibility at this mid way stage in the UK election cycle. I guess it's possible the Tory Party are holding something in reserve to roll out in time for the next election in the hope of winning themselves yet another term in charge by smearing the competition (having given up at that stage of trying to win voters on the back of their own successes and record), but with the next election being 2023 at the earliest even this scenario pushes any induced leadership debacle outside this question's timeframe. Would any seismic changes on the other side of the political divide induce a leadership challenge for Labour?  With BoJo's fate seemingly far more in the hazard than Starmer's at this moment, and with the Tory Party conference in October potentially being his \"Thatcher\" moment (Tory conference 11th October 1990, Thatcher resigned 22nd November 1990 after failing to win a majority in the annual vote [4]), I guess it's possible that opportunists in Labour might try their hand at a time of general leadership reshuffling but it seems much more likely in this scenario that they'd be content to make hay with the resultant upheaval on the opposite benches rather than mask it with their own internal wrangling.  That would be the politically savvy move, but with the UK Labour party you can never fully bank on that as a forecasting certainty. [EDIT]: Conversely, if the October Conference season for Johnson goes comparatively well with no obvious Brutus moments manifesting for him, this could very much have an impact on Starmer's position (see updated forecast accounting for this scenario). With all the above, the most credible route of attack on Starmer's leadership at this moment seems to be against competence and popular impact.  With no obvious challenger offering anything better on either front, and with Labour's dalliance with hard left Corbynism still weighing heavily on their MPs at a local level any challenge in this 8 month, mid election cycle timeframe seems strategically foolish and incredibly unlikely (although Labour have in recent times proven themselves adept at jamming both feet in their mouth at once, so it can't legitimately be a 0% certainty!).

Additionally, my perception is that Corbyn has been unpopular as Labour leader for a while and that Starmer is not nearly unpopular enough to provoke a challenge. 2016 challenge against Corbyn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Labour_Party_leadership_election_(UK) Useful info plus a figure at the bottom shows the history of leadership contests in the Labour party: https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/labour-party-leadership-contests"], [1333, "2021-08-22T20:41:45Z", [0.97], ""], [45594, "2021-08-22T11:55:45Z", [0.05], ""], [102306, "2021-08-22T10:43:52Z", [0.13], "- no clear contenders\n- too much infighting between potentials\n- R says 60\n"], [93350, "2021-08-22T08:27:32Z", [0.15], "The Labour Party suffered a dramatic defeat in 2019 under the leadership of Corbyn. The voters rejected the prospect of a hard left government and elected the relative soft \u2018c\u2019 (as it turned out) conservatism of Boris Johnson.\nHistory has shown that the country is centrist in its voting patterns.\nStarmer won the Leadership election by promising to uphold the left leaning policies of the previous leadership which also managed to appease the largest provider of their funding i.e McCluskey and his Unite union.\nMcCluskey is retiring and the potential is for a softer left leadership of the union.\nStarmer\u2019s actions since his election has been to steer away from the left factions, bar Corbyn and upset the Union(s) that has resulted in membership numbers and funding.\nThe realisation being that only (relatively) centrist parties can win elections, with the example of Blair being the most successful (3 times elected as PM).\nHistory may repeat itself here, where in the 1980\u2019s Neil Kinnock (centrist) took over from the hard left leadership of Michael Foot and then resisted a challenge from the hard left Tony Benn, purged left wing factions such as militant tendency and made ready the Labour Party to be electable under Tony Blair.\nKeir Starmer may represent the 2020\u2019s version of Kinnock by purging the left to make the party electable again.\nThe threat from the hard left of the party that is represented by the Campaign Group comprises of 32 MPs (two others, Corbyn & Webb have been suspended) which falls below the 20% (40 MPs) to allow for a challenge.\nA potential challenge could come from Andy Burnham, successful minister from the Blair administration, who has proved to be electable as the Mayor of Greater Manchester. He has stated that he will remain in his elected position until 2025 but has not ruled out a return to national politics at some point.\nI will suggest that Keir Starmer will probably remain the Labour Party Leader for the foreseeable future as the threat from the left is diminishing and the right needs time to consolidate and develop an electable party/program. https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/08/jeremy-corbyn-could-be-reinstated-as-labour-mp-under-leftwing-challenge-to-starmer  https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rule-Book-2020.pdf  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Campaign_Group  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/02/after-batley-reprieve-keir-starmer-has-hard-task-ahead-to-win-over-doubters  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51193219  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/19/left-unite-leadership-election-howard-beckett  https://labourlist.org/2021/07/pro-starmer-labour-to-win-celebrates-gains-at-london-labour-conference/  https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/49689/1/the-keir-starmer-effect-why-young-people-are-leaving-the-labour-party  https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2021/07/will-there-be-labour-left-leadership-challenge-keir-starmer  https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/18/keir-starmer-expected-to-back-purge-of-far-left-labour-factions  https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/is-keir-starmer-destined-to-become-a-kinnock-esque-figure-\nhttps://labourhub.org.uk/2021/06/15/starmer-more-kinnock-that-blair/  https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/25/keir-starmer-shrinking-labour-party-members-broad-church  https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/andy-burnham-not-after-keir-starmers-job-yet-labour-manifesto-ready-1096561  https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/andy-burnham-election-mayor-manchester-b933993.html  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13619469408581315?journalCode=fcbh19\n"], [74523, "2021-08-22T07:38:00Z", [0.08], ""], [89038, "2021-08-21T20:53:58Z", [0.07], ""], [691, "2021-08-21T20:26:47Z", [0.04], "John 6:68, mutatis mutandis"], [1333, "2021-08-21T20:05:16Z", [0.97], ""], [90237, "2021-08-21T14:47:14Z", [0.0], ""], [101364, "2021-08-21T14:29:21Z", [0.05], ""], [1333, "2021-08-21T13:37:41Z", [0.98], ""], [95503, "2021-08-21T10:18:54Z", [0.15], ""], [100664, "2021-08-21T06:50:20Z", [0.01], ""], [34815, "2021-08-21T03:45:39Z", [0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-08-21T03:31:02Z", [0.0], ""], [94872, "2021-08-21T02:43:04Z", [0.1], ""], [61713, "2021-08-20T22:27:42Z", [0.02], "The Left know they would lose if they try to challenge him, and 20% of Labour MPs is a high bar to clear anyway.
