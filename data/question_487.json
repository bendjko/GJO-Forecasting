The Standard Model does not predict the presence of WIMPs.

The premonition concerned research on a phenomenon known as \u201cpriming\u201d.\n..........\nThe pitfalls Dr Stodden points to get deeper as research increasingly involves sifting through untold quantities of data. Take subatomic physics, where data are churned out by the petabyte. It uses notoriously exacting methodological standards, setting an acceptable false-positive rate of one in 3.5m (known as the five-sigma standard). But maximising a single figure of merit, such as statistical significance, is never enough: witness the \u201cpentaquark\u201d saga. Quarks are normally seen only two or three at a time, but in the mid-2000s various labs found evidence of bizarre five-quark composites. The analyses met the five-sigma test. But the data were not \u201cblinded\u201d properly; the analysts knew a lot about where the numbers were coming from. When an experiment is not blinded, the chances that the experimenters will see what they \u201cshould\u201d see rise. This is why people analysing clinical-trials data should be blinded to whether data come from the \u201cstudy group\u201d or the control group. When looked for with proper blinding, the previously ubiquitous pentaquarks disappeared. Other data-heavy disciplines face similar challenges. Models which can be \u201ctuned\u201d in many different ways give researchers more scope to perceive a pattern where none exists. According to some estimates, three-quarters of published scientific papers in the field of machine learning are bunk because of this \u201coverfitting\u201d, says Sandy Pentland, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n....\nThe negative results are much more trustworthy; for the case where the power is 0.8 there are 875 negative results of which only 20 are false, giving an accuracy of over 97%. But researchers and the journals in which they publish are not very interested in negative results. They prefer to accentuate the positive, and thus the error-prone. Negative results account for just 10-30% of published scientific literature, depending on the discipline. This bias may be growing. A study of 4,600 papers from across the sciences conducted by Daniele Fanelli of the University of Edinburgh found that the proportion of negative results dropped from 30% to 14% between 1990 and 2007. Lesley Yellowlees, \npresident of Britain\u2019s Royal Society of Chemistry, has published more than 100 papers. She remembers only one that reported a negative result. Statisticians have ways to deal with such problems. But most scientists are not statisticians. Victoria Stodden, a statistician at Columbia, speaks for many in her trade when she says that scientists\u2019 grasp of statistics has not kept pace with the development of complex mathematical techniques for crunching data. Some scientists use inappropriate techniques because those are the ones they feel comfortable with; others latch on to new ones without understanding their  subtleties. Some just rely on the methods built into their software, even if they don\u2019t understand them.\nRetrieved from: http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble The full article covers a lot more ground.

The article states that luminosity is a measure of a collider's efficiency and is proportional to the number of collisions.   This increase in energy will also allow the beams to be more focused.  The overall operational goal is to improve optimization and to reduce uncertainty.  I would guess that besides the experimental data generated and captured by the LHC experiments that a parallel track will generate information for sensitivity analysis of existing predictive models.  Experimental data from the LHC can be provided as input for calibration of these predictive models. The LHC has been currently upgraded to 13 TeV.  So basically, with each improvement in energy output, the amount of data collected increases for a proportional amount of time of operation.

How likely is it that the theory is right?\n- No evidence found, so far. No falsification, either. Could be right, could be wrong. Obviously, the scientific community is not very sure about the theories validity anymore, making it not likely that a positive finding will be communicated offensively. How long will it take from a positive finding to an announcement?\n- Given the fact that supersymmetry theory seems to be empirically invalid to date, it seems very risky for LHC as an institution to announce a false positive: so it is plausible that they will carefully scrutinize their possible positive findings, will discuss them with peers, will try to reproduce the empirical result - and this will take time, probably very much time - making it less likely that we will have a positive announcement before 1 October this year.\n- Therefore, I would conclude that Goeffrey Carr from the Economist (see article referred to in the question's explanatory section) is overconfident with regard to the speed with which in 2017 LHC can empirically test the supersymmetric hypotheses. It seems (much) more likely that at the end of 2017 we won't be better informed of the theories validity. How likely is it that the theory can be confirmed with the current run of LHC - given that it is right?\n- unknown\u2026\n- Given the fact, that they tried to refine and adjust the LHC in several rounds and runs, it could well be possible that it is the wrong experiment to test the supersymmetric theory. At least it should be stated that it is disputable among scientific community how well suited the experiments of LHC are and whether the quality of the generated data is sufficient to infer what they wish to infer. All in all: experiments, theory, data: all is disputed\u2026 a positive announcement seems highly unlikely bevor 1 October this year, even if there would be a fitting pattern of supersymmetry theory in the data - since the announcement of a false positive result is likely to do a lot of harm to LHC. I think, however, the current consensus (2 percent) is a little bit underrating the event. I think it is very unlikely, however: starting with 5 per cent\u2026 ?  (BTW: Some commentators laughed at the theory and its funny terms. However, the history of science is full of theories that were correct but where completely mocked, e.g. Alfred Wegener was close to suicide since the world laughed at his continental drift theory, Max Planck and other quantum physicist earned a lot of criticism for their probability based model of the micro foundations of our universe, think of ancient ideas like democracy or the rather modern idea that humans could have rights that belong to them like a part of their body\u2026 many laughed at such concepts, but - eventually - they today shape our thinking to a large extent: and it seems unimaginable how someone could be mobbed and mocked just because he believed that it is a plausible scientific hypothesis that Africa and South America were once a single continent\u2026) Last but not least I see some potential for a clarification of the question:\nI am wondering a bit about the word \"announcement\" in the question since I do not really have an idea of what a positive announcement would look like. As I got it, LHC announcements on particles where so cautiously formulated that they hardly announced that they have discovered something with strong confidence\u2026 So, I think, there is clarification needed on what a positive announcement will be."], [35544, "2017-05-21T15:50:00Z", [0.02], "It is speculated that the discovery of such particles would bring about a \"paradigm shift\" in the field, meaning that this would be a MAJOR finding.
