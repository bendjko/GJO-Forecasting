Currently as I write this forecast, Norway has 13 gold medals and Germany just won their 14th gold medal in the 4 men bobsledding competition and are in the middle of the first period of the gold medal hockey game against the Olympic Athletes from Russia.  Although the OAR hockey team has better young and veteran players, as well as a historically superior hockey tradition to that of the Germans, it is not a foregone conclusion.  Germany has advanced as a severe underdog in this tournament, recently beating the highly-favored Canadians in the semifinal game.  After the hockey game, the only event in the Olympics is the women\u2019s 30-kilometer cross country skiing competition.  The Norwegians are highly favored to win the gold, as their 3 competing skiers are in the top 5 in the world in this event; however, this event is historically random as earlier today, the men\u2019s 50-kilometer cross country skiing competition was not won by a top 5 ranked skier.  I am assigning a 90% valuation to Germany winning the most gold medals, but a 10% chance remains with the Norwegians.  If the Germans lose the hockey final and one of the Norwegian skiers wins the final cross-country race of the Olympics, both countries will have 14 gold medals.  If this occurs, the Good Judgment Project \u201cwill use the total number of medals to serve as a tiebreaker, followed by the total silver medals and then bronze medals, if needed.\u201d  Currently, Germany has 30 medals and Norway has 38 medals.  Germany will not be able to catch up with Norway, even though they are guaranteed a silver if they lose the hockey final, but this will only give them a total of 31 medals.  At the same time, Norway can win 3 more medals if they sweep the women\u2019s cross-country skiing competition, which would give them a grand total of 41 medals in the Olympics, which is highly unlikely and improbable.  In the end, Germany has the best realistic chance to get the most gold medals, as they are in a tight game against the Olympic Athletes from Russia team and there are way too many variables in the cross-country competition, such as weather, crashes, equipment malfunction, and a 47-woman starting field, for Norway to get the 14th gold medal.  Ultimately, Germany will get the most gold medals, but a 10% doubt remains as Norway has won the most total medals by any country in a single Olympics, thus they cannot be discounted, especially in their strongest and most popular sport.

I am going to assume that, with only 1.5km to go, and almost 3 minutes behind, Norway will NOT win the Cross Country Skiing (men's 50km). What gold medal opportunities remain? I list these roughly from most to least likely ... \nGERMANY in the Bobsleigh (4-man) \nNORWAY in the Cross-Country Skiing (women) \nGERMANY in the Ice Hockey (men)  And a mathematical possibility, but highly unlikely: \nGERMANY: Speed Skating (women's mass start). \nNORWAY: Speed Skating (men's mass start). At the end of today, the Speed Skating will be done, and almost certainly, Germany and Norway will still be tied on 13 gold each.   Tomorrow morning (Korean/Australian time), before Eastern US ticks over midnight, Germany will hit the front with a gold in the Bobsleigh (4-man).  Given, after 2 of 4 runs, the leading German team is 0.29 seconds ahead of the 2nd-placed Korean team, and another German team is only 0.06 seconds behind the Koreans, I put this as a 0.9 chance of a German win. After that, the Ice Hockey - though the OAR are heavy favourites, who knows what might happen?  OAR lost to Slovakia, after all. Give Germany a 0.3 here: OAR are roughly twice as likely to win as Germany. Finally, the Cross Country Skiing (women's 30km).  Betting houses seem to give a probability somewhere in the realm of 0.58 for Norway, 0.31 for Sweden, and 0.11 for Finland.  Round that to 0.6 for a Norway win. Now simplify.  There are 3 events remaining.  Relatively speaking, for each event either Germany will \"win\" (either by winning gold in the Bobsleigh or Ice Hockey, or by Norway NOT winning gold in the Skiing), or Germany will \"lose\" (either by Norway winning gold in the Skiing, or by Germany NOT winning gold in the Bobsleigh or Ice Hockey).  Overall, Germany winds up on top of the medal count if it \"wins\" 2 or 3 of these three events; Norway winds up on top or ties if Germany only \"wins\" 0 or 1 of these three events. Assuming the events are independent of each other, the possible outcomes are, in order of probability:\nGermany WINS Bobsleigh; Norway WINS Skiing ; Germany LOSES Hockey --->  p=0.378\nGermany WINS Bobsleigh; Norway LOSES Skiing ; Germany LOSES Hockey --->  p=0.252\nGermany WINS Bobsleigh; Norway WINS Skiing ; Germany WINS Hockey --->  p=0.162\nGermany WINS Bobsleigh; Norway LOSES Skiing ; Germany WINS Hockey --->  p=0.108\nGermany LOSES Bobsleigh; Norway WINS Skiing ; Germany LOSES Hockey --->  p=0.042\nGermany LOSES Bobsleigh; Norway LOSES Skiing ; Germany LOSES Hockey --->  p=0.028\nGermany LOSES Bobsleigh; Norway WINS Skiing ; Germany WINS Hockey --->  p=0.018\nGermany LOSES Bobsleigh; Norway LOSES Skiing ; Germany WINS Hockey --->  p=0.012 Overall, Germany \"wins\" 2 or 3 events, and thus tops the gold medal count 53.4% of the time.\nGermany \"wins\" 0 or 1 event, thus Norway tops (or ties) the gold medal count 46.6% of the time.

There is a general consensus that Norway are more likely to win a few more medals overall. Actual gold medals to date (Germany 9, Norway 6) put Germany 1-2 gold ahead of where they would have been projected to be, and Norway 1-2 behind, based on projections for the specific events completed.  On that basis, Norway have fallen a little behind Germany. Looking at the \"tail\" of projected medals, both Germany and Norway could have been expected to be \"gold heavy\".  In actually won medals, Germany currently has 9 gold from 15 medals, and Norway has 6 gold from 19 medals.  In other words, Germany have so far converted medal chances into gold medals at roughly the expected rate; Norway has disproportionately (compared to expectations) won silver and bronze. Putting all this together, I would project the most likely outcome to be Germany 2 gold ahead of Norway at the end of the Games.  We are just under half-way through (from a medal point of view), and 2 gold is actually a fair margin to overcome given how close the eventual medal tallies (excluding host nations) usually are. Finally, German is currently at 9 gold, and a reasonable chance of winning 6 more (thanks, @michalbod!).  In the past 5 Winter Olympics, once the host is excluded, the \"gold medal winning-est\" nation received: 11, 10, 11, 12, and 11 gold medals.  The second-placed nation received: 10, 9, 9, 10, 9. For Norway to pass Germany from here, they would need to do VERY well, AND have Germany do poorly.  These eventualities are, in my opinion, only very weakly positively correlated.  I figure Germany's odds are 4 times better than Norway's (4:1 = 80:20) [[Among the others, the Netherlands and the USA seem to be slightly out-performing expectations; Canada performing at expectations.  Any of these three _might_ get to 10 gold, with the USA somewhat more likely than the other two but, unlike Norway, a MASSIVE collapse of the German team from this point onwards would be required to let any of those three slip in front of the German total.  Norway is, IMHO, the only realistic candidate who could pass Germany without a German collapse.]] REFERENCES:\n_Many_ pages arising from a Google search for \"projections for 2018 winter olympics medals\".
