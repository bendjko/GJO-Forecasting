[1]\n\"And AT&T announced it will carry additional Samsung 5G phones by the second half of 2019 (no word yet on the specific devices though)\" [1]. This points toward a later release for any other Samsung phones.\n- LG also seems make its devices available through AT&T only later in the year. [1] Sprint:\n-  \"The V50 will also be Sprint's first 5G phone\" [1]\n- The release date in Korea seems to be April 19 [6]. US release does not seem to have been announced yet. If the delay between the two is similar to Samsung (see below), a release around early June seems somewhat likely. Verizon:\n- Verizon's first device will be the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, which will first be available exclusively through Verizon. [1] In this article it says it will be available through other carriers \"a few months later\" [5]\n- \"Leaked render hints Verizon Galaxy S10 5G release for May 16\". It's already been successfully released in Korea a few days ago. [4] [5] T-Mobile:\n- On their website it merely says: \"The first 5G phones will be available this year.\" [7]\n- They seem to have delayed their full commercial 5G launch until the second half of the year due to technical differences to the other carriers. [8] Overall judgment:\n- It seems very plausible to me that Verizon will launch the Samsung S10 before July 1. The leak seems fairly reliable from what I can tell, its already been released in another country, and Verizon has planned its 5G roll-out for April as well. I'd judge 90% that the phone will be launched before that date.\n- The V50 is a bit harder to tell. They have already announced a release date fairly soon in Korea and Sprint has planned their 5G roll-out for May as well [8]. Overall, I'd judge there is a 70% probability they will also launch before the date.\n- I think it's unlikely that Samsung or LG will make its phones available to AT&T or T-Mobile available before the date, based on the little that I've read on this. They don't seem to have other plans of their own. Even conditional on releases of the others before July 1, 6% for AT&T and 3% for T-Mobile seem adequate. There just isn't that much time. I'm not sure how to calculate the probabilities for 3 and 4 companies, so I'll just eyeball.\n- 0: .1*.3=.03\n- 1: .9*.3+.7*.1=.34\n- 2: .9*.7=.63 [1] https://www.cnet.com/news/forget-att-fake-5ge-here-are-the-real-5g-phones-that-are-coming-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-deployment-chicago/\n[2] https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/09/att-5g-live-in-seven-more-cities/\n[3] https://about.att.com/story/2019/mobile_5g.html\n[4] https://www.sammobile.com/2019/04/08/render-verizon-galaxy-s10-5g-release-may-16/\n[5] https://www.digitaltrends.com/android/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-news/\n[6] https://www.techradar.com/news/lgs-true-5g-ready-v50-thinq-has-a-release-date-and-price\n[7] https://www.t-mobile.com/5g\n[8] https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/sprint-5g-rollout/"], [1333, "2019-04-09T18:52:35Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.37, 0.46, 0.15], ""], [63963, "2019-04-08T15:18:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.4, 0.1], ""], [37379, "2019-04-08T03:51:30Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.35, 0.45, 0.15], ""], [172, "2019-04-08T01:53:02Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [13377, "2019-04-07T10:16:31Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.3, 0.49, 0.12], ""], [41707, "2019-04-07T09:44:31Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.48, 0.4, 0.07], ""], [1333, "2019-04-06T18:20:06Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.36, 0.46, 0.15], ""], [172, "2019-04-06T14:55:04Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0], "Verizon/Samsung announced (albeit limited geography).

Without an adequate 5G network, 5G smartphones are not that useful.  LIfewire has a recent update on the status of the 5G networks in the US [1]. \nNote that the US companies have been focusing on delivering 5G internet access (in home and in companies) first with the mobile 5G network coming in later. In the US, Verizon\u2019s 5G network is the most developed.  Its home/company network has been live in several cities since the end of 2018.  But its mobile network is being rolling out in April 2019 in only parts of Chicago and Minneapolis.  Two 5G phones, Samsung Galaxy S10 5G and LG V50 ThinQ 5G, will be available for launch in Verizon in 2019 [2].  Without a wide 5G network, it is hard to image that there is a rush to make 5G smartphones available.   On the other hand, the Galaxy S10 5G is going to be exclusive for Verizon at the beginning.  With two phones in the plan, I give a 70% chance for Verizon to have a 5G phone to sell by 30 June. ATT\u2019s 5G E (for Evolution) network was launched in 2018, but it is not a real 5G network.  The real 5G network will roll out in the first half of 2019.  The same Galaxy and LG 5G phones are mentioned as available but the Galaxy is only available to ATT after the exclusivity period in Verizon (how ever long that is).  This, together with the less developed state of its 5G network, I give a 30% chance that a 5G phone being available for ATT customers by the end of the first half of 2019. Sprint will provide mobile 5G service to several cities starting in May.  Again the same two phones are mentioned to be available.  I give a 30% chance (same as ATT) that one will be available by 30 June. T-Mobile is, once again, dances to a different tune.  Unlike the other 3 networks, it is not rolling out 5G network bit by bit [3].  No 5G network is expected to be available until there is a national wide coverage.  As a result, no 5G smartphones will be available before then.    Take the probability of 70%, 30%, 30% and 0% for the available 5G smartphones for the 4 companies, the forecast for \n1 company only:    47%, \n2 companies only: 32%, \n3 companies only: 19%, \n4 companies:           0% and \nno company:            2%. \n(These values are computed conditional probabilities using a Venn diagram, such as described in [4].

Their plan is to include 9 US cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and Washington, DC. Verizon announced similar plans back in January saying they were planning to release 5G phones in first half of 2019. 5G can offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks. Apple said they are planning to wait until 2020 to release 5G iPhones (as reported by Bloomberg) Sprint sued AT&T late on Thursday, saying it is misleading consumers into believing that it is using fifth-generation wireless network, known as 5G, a technology that has not yet been widely deployed. AT&T customers are seeing a \u201c5G E\u201d logo on their mobile devices in over 400 markets. Although users are still using 4G network, AT&T is calling it 5G Evolution, a faster version of its existing network and a first step on the road to 5G. 5G can offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than 4G networks. The Samsung Galaxy S10 5G model could be the first mainstream device to run on 5G networks later this year (CNN).  Carriers are announcing \"aggressive\" launch dates but it's notable that, as it's been widely reported, full-scale coverage may be years away.  The technology needed for 5G requires \"a higher-frequency band of the wireless spectrum called millimeter wave that allows data to be transferred much more rapidly than the lower-frequency band dedicated to 4G. But millimeter wave signals don't travel as far. This means that 5G networks will require many more, smaller antennas spaced closer together. \nBottomline, 5G cellular waves needed for 5G do not travel as far as with 4G and 3G, and it will take time for carriers to build a sufficiently dense network of infrastructure. So what incentives do the companies have -other than competitive advantage- to offer these phones before they can be widely sold? \nSprint is offering them in 9 cities.  \nT-Mobile has just started promoting a new website to push their merger with Sprint announcing it will allow them to offer 5G as a cheaper and faster home Internet option compared to cable TV.  \nSo, it all seems to be moving fast and steady but we've been there with electric cars testing in NYC, charging stations etc. "], [67530, "2019-02-20T18:07:04Z", [0.07, 0.45, 0.3, 0.15, 0.03], "With some companies looking at attempting mergers, it stands to reason that they would want to present a strong, innovation based public image.
