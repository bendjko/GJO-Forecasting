This is due to expecting another 20-30% increase of the two vehicles in Q4 over Q3.  With their China Gigafactory coming into production and the front and rear being a single stamped piece, I believe that they will increase their numbers.  A decrease from Q3 would be the only way they don't hit 400,000 deliveries, which I view as extremely unlikely.  I almost never make such a strong prediction, but this is a case that I must make that prediction.  I am assuming that California continues to keep a grip on the COVID spread and prevents shutdown.
