As of January 2021, there are more than seven contractors for each U.S. military service member remaining in Afghanistan, amounting to over 18,000 contractors according to figures from U.S. Central Command. In January 2021, then-incoming president Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. would review the peace agreement in order to effectively withdraw its remaining 2,500 soldiers from Afghanistan. Biden supported a full withdrawal in 2014 but it was initially unclear as to whether he would uphold Trump's May 2021 withdrawal deadline. In March 2021, news reports stated that President Biden was potentially considering keeping U.S. forces in Afghanistan until November 2021. On 14 April 2021, Biden announced his intention to withdraw all regular U.S. troops by 11 September 2021, the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks and four months after the initially planned 1 May deadline. The day before the announcement, Biden called former U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama regarding his decision to withdraw. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the decision was made in order to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic. Following withdrawal, the U.S. is reportedly considering options for redeploying troops such as relocating to U.S. Navy vessels, countries in the Middle East, or Central Asian countries like Tajikistan.'\nOn 18 February 2021, Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance has not made a decision on how to proceed regarding the withdrawal. Britain is expected to withdraw its remaining 750 Resolute Support Mission troops at the same time as the U.S. According to the plan, NATO troops would also follow the same withdrawal timeline. The U.S. indicated that some troops (the exact number had not yet been decided) will remain in the country to provide diplomatic security, and is unclear what will happen to the several hundred U.S. special operations forces working for the CIA on counter-terrorism missions. New CIA Director William Joseph Burns told the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on 14 April 2021 that \"[t]here is a significant risk once the U.S. military and the coalition militaries withdraw\" but added that the U.S. would retain \"a suite of capabilities.\" The administration of President Biden intends to use a broad array of foreign police tools stretching from military occupation to total abandonment.'\nCNBC, 08/13/21, 'Canada to send special forces to Afghanistan to close embassy in Kabul, official says': https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/canada-to-send-special-forces-to-afghanistan-to-close-kabul-embassy.html\nBBC News, 08/13/21, 'Afghanistan: UK troops sent to get Britons out as Taliban advances': https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58195286\nAbout 600 UK troops are to be sent to Afghanistan to assist British nationals to leave, the government has announced.\nThe Fayetteville Observer, 08/12/21, 'Fort Bragg troops to deploy to aid evacuation of Americans from U.S. embassy in Afghanistan': https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/2021/08/12/fort-bragg-immediate-response-force-rapidly-deploys-middle-east/8114481002/\nClips from Observer article:\n'Pentagon officials said Thursday that 3,000 troops were being sent immediately.\nAn additional infantry brigade force of about 3,500 from Fort Bragg will be flown from the United States to the Middle East to stand by in case they are needed. \nLt.

Instead of rewriting my thoughts, I'll just share the above quote which makes good sense to me. On the other hand, why did the Taliban attack the embassy in the past?  Also, in those past instances, embassy staff sheltered in a bunker. Perhaps RPGs from the insurgents are too big a risk for helicopter evacuation. Given this info, if any evacuation were to happen it would be proactively done before the threat is too dangerous. We could be seeing this scenario unfolding as evident by the embassy urging US citizens to leave the country, which means the embassy may not need to do its job. I guess a proxy would be to see what other foreign countries are doing. So far India has urged its citizens to leave as well and Australia has shut down its embassy. A word about the nature of the fighting: To me, it seems that most of the attacks are against the government forces and not on civilians or targeted Americans / foreigners. The threat was vocal that foreigners left behind are a target, but as of right now, it doesn't seem that way. What this tells me is that the Taliban is indeed heeding its word not to interfere with diplomatic or humanitarian work, which would render the embassy safe from Taliban attack. But then you have rogue soldiers and egotistical warlords wanting to cause a strife. We must look out for the Taliban taking other big cities. If this occurs, it may give them the confidence to take on a larger cirty such as Kabul; after all, it is possible they are attacking from the outside and moving inward? Perhaps to trap people in?

He believes that in order to avoid the status of \"pariah state,\" a Taliban-run Afghanistan would have to accept the terms dictated by the U.S. There is no reason to believe this; that is, there is no reason to believe that Afghanistan would have the status of a pariah state, and there is no reason to believe that the Taliban would fear this status even if it became a reality.  For Pakistan, Afghanistan represents strategic depth with regard to India. Iran has has its own problems with the Taliban, but there is no reason to think that Iran would in any way penalize Taliban-led Afghanistan for refusing to acquiesce to U.S. wishes. Russia and China would probably be perfectly delighted to deal with Afghanistan if such a relationship annoyed the United States.
