To bow out now and hand over to younger blood would feel like giving in to a personal defeat and Breyer seems to be a proud person with an interest in his legacy on the SC. My previous premise that Dems would ideally not like an SC seat to be an animating factor for Republicans during the 2022 terms has likely been drowned out by the other, more noisy, angles both sides seem to be taking.  So Breyer's retirement after the Mississippi challenge (after this session ends in summer 22) now seems far more likely and less politically impactful than I'd previously surmised. Breyer will probably make this his legacy decision (or dissent) and then step down after this SC term to allow the Biden team the room to smoothly swap in another moderate / Liberal justice a few months before the 2022 mid terms (holding Liberal seats on the SC whilst they can and neatly taking the SC seat off the ballot for November 22 in the same moment). Risky, in case the Reps find a way to stall beyond the mid terms (pressure or promises to one of the more conservative Dems: Manchin or Sinema?) and/or if the numbers in the Senate change in this time, but Breyer seems determined to leave something behind he can be proud of and does not appear to be swayed by the noisy voices warning of a repeat of the RBG debacle. All other routes to a surprise vacancy remain theoretically open but base rated in the \"very unlikely\" / \"extraordinary event\" zone.  Dropping to align with the crowd now.

In my mind (and for this forecast) these are more empirically reliable factors for forecasting against than the wishes and desires of one man (and any statements he might wish to make on the subject).

Reviewing his caseload, it appears to be pretty steady and he has hired a full slate of law clerks for the next term, which suggests that he plans to be around for the remainder of the year.  However, there is significant pressure from Democrats and progressives for Breyer to step down out of fear of loosing the Senate in the mid-terms, which history supports is very possible.  At this time, I have no reason to believe that Breyer will step down this year.  The next oldest justices are Thomas (72) and Alito (71).  I do not see either one of them going anywhere anytime soon, especially under a Democratic Administration, with the exception of suddenly passing away.

Such a scenario would take time and be very \"out in the open\": very unlikely in the backdrop of 2021's priorities and turbulence.  Given its popularity and the Republicans focus on regaining some form of legislative control in 2022, the COVID relief package would seem a very unwise hand for Republicans to play their SC \"Trump\" card in (forgive the unavoidable pun).

A raise for \"1\" given that Dems seem keen to make the most of their wholesale control of all three branches while they have it. With 2022 shaping up to be the next big political fight for legislative control, and with redistricting and gerrymandering at state level [1 & 2] making a return to Republican Senate (and potentially House) control a viable possibility, the likelihood of Breyer being encouraged to retire in 2021 (to take this off the table as a conservative animating voting issue in 2022) feels somewhat more likely.

Equally: a Republican led, state level legal challenge to this bill (founded on a claim of federal government overreach) making its way to the conservative heavy SC seems equally likely. This scenario also seems to increase the likelihood of a Breyer retirement, with Dems wanting to shore up as much of their SC control as possible to give this critical political bill the best chance in the SC.  It also seems fair to say that Dems will have learnt a painful lesson from the sudden and tragic demise of RBG at the worst possible moment and would wish to leave less to chance in the future. Lots of reasons why a graceful 2021 departure for Breyer is a sound political and strategic move for Democrats.

Let start with the big picture. The average justice since 1900 serves an average of 26 years on the bench. The average of justices who choose to retire is about 74 years old. Five of the last eight President's had a vacancy in their first year in office. This includes the last two Democratic Presidents who were boosted by a retirement during their first year (1993 and 2009). The overall rate of a vaccancy is one about ever 2.06 years. Based on this, there are two Justices who are likely on retirement watch, Justice Thomas and Justice Breyer. Justice Thomas is extremely unlikely to retire. An opening of his seat would likely be due to health issues although that does not appear to be an immediate concern.  Justice Breyer however will be under extreme pressure to retire during the next two years. Although the Senate map is favorable in 2022, Liberal democrats will likely not want to take the risk and will apply pressure on Breyer during the next 12 months. Will he be receptive? I think he will be more than perhaps a year ago given the RGB seat and the general politics of the day. It could be interesting to wathc his votes and opinions during the Spring term for any hints of his thinking.  That is only half the story. There is also the push from the left on court packing, or adding seats. President Biden has not ruled it out but has generally not been overly supportive of the idea. His compromise was a commission to study court reform that could be announced in the coming days. They have a six month timeline to produce a final report so a decision on court-packing might not come this year. The commission is also being headed by someone who in 2018 shot down the idea of court-packing. The recommendation is more likely to focus on term-limits, ethics code, and bringing the court into the 21st century. Bottom line, in 2021 Senate Democrats and the President will likely focus more on lower court openings and being ready if Breyer does announce his retirement.

The only real candidate for health problems or retirement would be Stephen Breyer.  As the oldest member of the court at age 82, health could become a factor.  The most likely scenario, however, would be his retirement resulting from political pressure on the left.  There is a desire for him to retire while Democrats control both the White House and Senate to ensure his seat remains liberal for decades to come.  If this is to happen, it is highly likely it would be in 2021 to avoid campaign issues in 2022.  However, Breyer has not given any indication that his retirement is imminent.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-court/u-s-supreme-courts-breyer-in-retirement-spotlight-after-democratic-wins-idUSKBN29C2S5 The likelihood of two or more seats coming vacant would likely be a result of Democrats seeking to pack the court. While there was much discussion on this potential during the 2020 Presidential Election, there is no consensus among Democrats that this would be a desirable tactic, so I place the odds of this happening at 0%."], [94563, "2021-01-30T14:00:39Z", [0.7, 0.28, 0.02, 0.0], "Updated based on reading some of the other rationale's re: Justice Breyer."], [88452, "2021-01-30T12:44:27Z", [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0], "Convinced by the Breyer argument of @MagicTheatre4MadMen and @William-C-Anders "], [34815, "2021-01-30T08:02:19Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [60695, "2021-01-30T07:27:05Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67232, "2021-01-30T07:01:38Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], "There is not much chance of the six conservatives retiring during a Democratic presidency.  They also appear healthy so I do not feel a need to consult the Social Security survivorship tables.  I believe the chances of one of the conservatives dying is also pretty low.  Among the liberals, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan could retire during a Democratic presidency but Supreme Court justices typically serve until their 80s and both are in their 60s.  Thus, I doubt either one will retire.  Both seem healthy.  I doubt either one will die in the next year.   Justice Breyer has said he will retire at some point per Fox News article below.  He will not go out like RBG--working literally until the day she died.   This year is Justice Breyer's best to leave and get a successor he likes.  If he stays, until the end of the Biden presidency, he will be 84-years-old and who knows what will follow: Another Trump?  He would be 88-years-old at the end of that term, and he did say he wanted to retire.    Biden would likely appoint someone likeminded to both Breyer and Biden, and there are 50 Democratic votes to approve.  The democrats will need one Republican since 51 votes (not including the VP) are needed to break a filibuster.   I think they can negotiate with either Mitt Romney, Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski to find an acceptable nominee to get past this.   Justice Breyer worked for the senate judiciary committee under Senator Edward Kennedy before becoming a judge so he understands the politics of a nomination better than most.   To that end, there is no guarantee that Democrats will still control the senate after the 2022 election, and Republicans might hold the position open until 2024 if Breyer retired in 2023 or 2024.  Remember Merritt Garland!   Also, just today,  Vermont Senator Leahy had to leave the senate by ambulance due to illness.  Vermont has a Republican Governor, and Leahy and a number of other Democratic senators are in their 80s.  Thus, Democrats could lose the senate literally at any moment.   Breyer almost certainly wants to retire in sufficient time for a thorough vetting process to be completed and to give the president a second nomination opportunity, if needed.    Most justices retire near the end of the term unless there is a medical issue.  The current term ends and the new term begins the first Monday in October.   I suspect Breyer will announce his retirement sometime after the impeachment trial so as not to be a distraction.  I also thought he might announce prior to the period for applications for law clerks began to let any potential clerk know not to apply.  Unfortunately, I could not find a day by which prospective law clerks to the Supreme Court have to turn in their applications, but I did find some for the lower courts, including the Ninth and D.C. Circuits.  The dates vary from end of February to mid-June.     I also briefly looked at the dates some other more recent justices announced their retirements.  Mid-April for Justice Kennedy was the earliest and September for Justice Stewart was the latest, except in cases of illness, e.g., Marshall. Thus, I am back where I started:  what would be a sufficient amount of time to allow a new justice to start in October and the president sufficient time to complete the process--which should be extremely contentious in the current climate?    I think five to eight months before October would likely be the time frame.  However, eight months would conflict with impeachment, which will likely end in  February or March, Therefore, I think  we will know between the end of February and end of May  if he is leaving this year.  After that, my forecast will be near 100 percent  for zero.   https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-eventually\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomination_and_confirmation_to_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"], [98222, "2021-01-30T05:57:16Z", [0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [22689, "2021-01-30T05:45:30Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67232, "2021-01-30T05:31:20Z", [0.45, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [754, "2021-01-30T04:33:44Z", [0.35, 0.57, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [14847, "2021-01-30T02:37:31Z", [0.33, 0.59, 0.08, 0.0], "2 is more of a \"covid party time!\" thing"], [14847, "2021-01-30T02:32:16Z", [0.34, 0.58, 0.08, 0.0], "Justice Breyer is tired of your bs and really wants to see Milan and Paris once everything reopens"], [94872, "2021-01-30T02:02:58Z", [0.64, 0.34, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [88002, "2021-01-30T01:28:45Z", [0.45, 0.45, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [92079, "2021-01-30T01:19:48Z", [0.05, 0.9, 0.05, 0.0], "With razor thin margins in the Senate and the cautionary tale of RBG's vacancy I believe 82 year old Justice Breyer will look to cement his legacy by retiring and allowing Biden to nominate a Progressive candidate that can shape the court for decades to come.
