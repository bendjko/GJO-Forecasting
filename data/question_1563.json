Out of the 2, the president is more susceptible to being ousted. However the supreme leader is older and is more susceptible to sickness. Chance of supreme leader dying: 8%. If he dies, I think there's a fairly high (75%) chance that the president will take over. - splitting 2% he dies without takeover, 6% he dies and is taken over by president. Chance of president dying: 3%.  Chance of both dying: 3%*8% = ~1%. Adding 2% to above predictions due to chance of them being ousted. Adding additional 2% to president's chances of being ousted. +3% all round due to uncertainty. I could see food shortages being a problem.

Next election due in 2021. Majority increased from 2013 Mortality (Outside)\nThe first thing to focus on is the age of both men. The supreme leader (SL), is 80 and the President (P) is 71. The life expectancy for Iranian men is 75. The age of death of the previous SL and P averages at 81, which is significant because they have better access to health care than the general population. Which if regressed to the mean, this gives a life expectancy of 78.  According to research, 2/3 of 70 year old men make it to their 80th birthday. Meaning 33% die. Divide that by the 10 year period gives you the chance of dying in 12 months. 3.3% An 80 year old man has only 1/5 chance of making 90. 80% chance he won\u2019t, / the 10 year period. 8% chance he dies in the next year. \nThere is also therefore a 1% chance they both die.  Regime (outside) \nSince the shah was defeated in 79, there has only been 2 SL. The current SL took the role from presidency, so we can assume that if the SL dies from natural causes, the P has a good chance of becoming SL. There is roughly a 5% chance the SL dies and the P does not. So let\u2019s assume a 2% chance the P could be the SL.  Presidency (outside) \nPresidential elections in Iran happen every 4 years. Since 1981, there has been no early elections. The next elections are due in 2021. If early elections were called. The P has a healthy lead at 57% in round 1 (2017). 1% chance this happens.  Regime change (outside). \nHow would a SL change? Only the US would have the capability, via direct or indirect action, to force a coup. Since the 90\u2019s. The US have been involved in 11 coup attempts. 4 of which were successful is changing leadership. 11 in 30 years is 36% x 34% success rate. Roughly 10% chance. Lower that a little as the attempted US coups took place all over the world. 6% is about right.  (Inside)\nThe most important factor from the outside is the current Covid 19 pandemic. \nAs both men are in the at risk categories.  British experts say 80% of people will get the virus. And mortality rates for a 80 year old is 14%. 70 = 8%.  So the chance of dying from Covid 19. 80% x 14 % = 11% (SL)\n80% x 8% = 6.4% (P)  Let\u2019s assume because they have access to better healthcare and more assurances will be taken. -3% from both. \nSL 8% \nP 4%  Other factors to consider - \nInternal uprisings - low chance considering the power the gov have. 1%  Economic decrease due to Covid - little relevance to the above considered as regime change at SL level will only occur through death, resignation, or coup/military. However it does increase tensions. +1%.  I will also increase both to leave by 5% as I just have a feeling of increased tension. \n\nLet me know what you think.
