However, there are two arguments why that may not happen: - CDC claimed that their data has a 5 days lag. This means by the time GJ Open checked the data on 28th Feb 10 pm, the count will only accurately reflect the data up to 23rd Feb, partially reflect the data for 24th - 26th, and almost non-existent for 27th-28th. The last two days alone, from extrapolation, normally account for 1.5m shots. - We're seeing signs that the vaccine distribution may be slowing down from 15th to 22 Feb, presumably due to a snowstorm. Power cuts are reported, stopping the government from distributing the vaccines since refrigerators to keep them cool are off. It is possible that when the snow ends, the vaccination resumes since the vaccines have been restocked, but I am skeptical if there is a big surge since the speed of injecting the vaccine will be a choke point.

It does look like it's varying between 30%-50% right now... SO! I gotta adjust again. We're at about 40M today. We're looking at about 1.5M doses/day (7-day moving average). Although we had seen each progressive week raise over the week prior, the last two weeks we have solid data for make it look like we may have leveled off. So if we look at something a little more like ~35% as the number of new doses that are actually second doses, we're looking at more like 975K-1M \"new arms\" per day.

There has been pushback on that and based on current numbers, I don't see how they can do that and still give the second vaccine in a timely manner.   Current Moderna allocations are about 3.5m a week for first doses and a similar amount for second doses (which is shipped 3 weeks later).  Pfizer is at about 2m a week.

Severe winter weather in the northern states could slow down all processes that I understand as part of the administration (checks on charges/quality control, analysis of supply/demand situation in counties, planning and delivery to the actual vaccination site) for the next two weeks, and cancelled appointments due to road conditions could counter and nil the effect of increased distribution entirely.\nEven under a very optimistic assumption that the figures Number of \"People Receiving 1 or More Doses\" and \"Total Doses Administered\" will approach 66% in the medium term according to the share of one-shot-regimen vaccines and two-shot-regimen vaccines with first doses growing faster than second doses (thus, the respective rate People Receiving 1 or More Doses/Total Doses Administered could approach ca. 80% at maximum when second doses are entirely neglected), there is still the number of people receiving their second dose only, which will not add to the total under scrutiny, and with hindsight to the fact that all vaccines currently administered - BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna - are currently two-doses-regimens unless the CDC changes its strategy for a first-shots-first strategy, second doses (currently at a rate of 400k on average a day) could subtract as many as 8mn doses from the maximum possible, which leaves us at 46mn or even less. A ten per cent increase of people vaccinated versus initial projection would be a giant step, but however desirable and welcome it will be, it will be hard to achieve. The initiative to source pharmacies and even WalMart as vaccination sites could in the medium term have such an effect, but beginning on 11 February only and on a limited scale, the impact on the outcome of this question will be minor. An estimate is between 47 and 49mn, due to unexpected effects in the distribution chain that I'm unaware of, and a possibly varying lag time of reporting and accuracy. If the involvement of pharmacies after 11 February 2021 changes the \"administration/distribution\" rate significantly, perhaps to 65% to70% due to less complex distribution, existing and established distribution routes, the outcome will look much differently. This effect will be seen from the data no sooner than 15 February 2021, and the maximum possible figure could reach up to 56mn, with the currently available two vaccines. Only with unconstrained fresh supply confirmed by producers, the stored capacity (Total Doses Delivered minus Total Doses Administered) will converge towards zero, since the necessary storage quota [\"stored capacity\"/(Number of People Receiving 1 or More Doses minus Number of People Receiving 2 Doses)], currently around 80%, can sink below 50%.\nhttps://us.cnn.com/2021/02/04/us/covid-19-vaccine-drug-stores/index.html First and foremost, currently there are mostly \"low hanging fruits \" harvested, which means hospital staff and other people that are easy to reach are vaccinated first, according to phase 1 of the vaccination. Once these are done, other groups in the next phase may kick in where  first doses could prove more difficult to administer.  An EUA by the FDA for the Janssen (J&J) single shot regime vaccine, which reportedly could happen \"next week\" (I expect at some point between 10 to 15 February 2021) is the huge wild card: due to massive pre-production, delivery could start at once (possibly it has already started), and it's the time span it takes from distribution to the status of \"administered\" which is unclear, but which will impact, for how many days before 28 February an estimated extra number of up to 1mn doses will be inoculated, and whether the statement:\n\"Building on last week\u2019s announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration will increase overall, weekly vaccine supply to states, Tribes, and territories to 10.5 million doses nationwide beginning this week. This is a 22% increase since taking office on January 20.\" refers to the initiation of the Janssen vaccine only, or whether it refers to the two already available vaccines only (in a cautious mode due to remaining uncertainties about a third EUA), or a combination of both. A final forecast will thus not be possible until estimated total deliveries of Janssen's vaccine for February will be available, and thus likely not before 20 February 2021.\nThe question's bins indicate or suggest there's a possibility of much larger numbers of people vaccinated on 28 February, but my overall impression is that this is misleading.

Unless we switch to a first doses first strategy. Currently the US is averaging around 1.3 million doses a day. I'm pretty confident based on manufacturing projections, the slow ramp up in injection volume, and the number of doses already held back that the US will average over 2 million doses a day through February, with around half of that being first doses. Here are some big factors at play: 1.) Many states and hospitals are (stupidly, in my opinion) holding back second doses. So although it seems like the US is going to use up all its available doses on second doses this month, that's not the case since many states still have a huge stock of doses not administered.\n2.) Getting shots in arms seems to be the biggest bottleneck. So it's possible that when more second doses come due injecting those eats up most of the injection capacity. I think this is probably unlikely, as they're starting the transition to pharmacies and most states are rolling into the second phase and my guess is the increased demand is going to kick some of these vaccination programs in gear.\n3.) Vaccine supply is not going to be a problem for long, though in the short term of the month of February it's less clear how large supply will be. Pfizer and Moderna's projections combine for a total of 200 million doses by the end of March. So they're planning on ramping up fast. The big question to me is how fast injections can ramp up.\n4.) Johnson and Johnson could be approved in a few weeks, and probably will have doses manufactured, but it sounds like it could be less than 10 million doses shipped out in February, so the role they play in this will probably be very small. Based on these factors I would guess an average of at least a million doses a day of first shots. An average of another million a day of second shots is needed to keep up with second doses. But with about 20 million doses already held in reserve it's just a matter of whether injections can scale up, and I think they can now that pharmacies are getting involved and more of the general public is eligible. If we stick with the inflexible 2 dose priority I think the ceiling is probably averaging like 1.5 million new shots a day so 65 million. But if we switch to be more flexible on the second dose I think there's a good chance 65+ could happen easily, I just think the chances of being less flexible on second doses are on the low side. Based on all that I'm going with this boring distribution centered around 56 to 59 million, which would be 1.2 to 1.3 million new vaccinations a day.
