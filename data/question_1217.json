Seeing some late weakness in polls, but probably landing in 33% range? About where they started...\n\u201cIn May Austria\u2019s government collapsed in spectacular fashion when a leaked video emerged, dating from 2017, showing Heinz-Christian Strache, vice-chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6), promising state contracts to a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch. It seemed to vindicate the warnings of those who disliked the decision of Sebastian Kurz, leader of the centre-right People\u2019s Party (\u00d6VP), to invite the FP\u00d6 into his coalition government. Yet when Austria returns to the polls on Sunday, not only is Mr Kurz set for a clear victory, he may resume where he left off with the FP\u00d6. The 33-year-old remains Austria\u2019s most popular party leader by far, retaining his reputation as an energetic reformist; meanwhile, the FP\u00d6\u2019s base has rallied around since the Strache scandal. Yet this would hardly be a recipe for stability. The FP\u00d6 has blown up every single past Austrian coalition to which it has belonged.\u201c"], [691, "2019-09-27T12:45:06Z", [0.1, 0.65, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20156, "2019-09-27T12:15:49Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.4, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [14107, "2019-09-27T07:29:20Z", [0.14, 0.6, 0.24, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [29907, "2019-09-26T21:48:36Z", [0.2, 0.58, 0.21, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-09-26T20:33:06Z", [0.09, 0.56, 0.3, 0.04, 0.01], ""], [691, "2019-09-26T12:23:24Z", [0.1, 0.65, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-09-26T00:15:24Z", [0.22, 0.59, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-25T18:24:54Z", [0.15, 0.54, 0.28, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-09-25T11:40:46Z", [0.14, 0.64, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [75935, "2019-09-25T07:22:03Z", [0.05, 0.72, 0.23, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31756, "2019-09-24T20:34:47Z", [0.0, 0.62, 0.38, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [62808, "2019-09-23T22:38:09Z", [0.0, 0.81, 0.19, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-09-23T18:12:24Z", [0.16, 0.57, 0.27, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [59881, "2019-09-23T16:58:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2019-09-23T15:01:03Z", [0.05, 0.75, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-09-23T12:53:19Z", [0.14, 0.64, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [29907, "2019-09-22T21:56:36Z", [0.11, 0.55, 0.33, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-09-21T13:37:41Z", [0.14, 0.64, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-21T12:47:30Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.32, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [79600, "2019-09-21T10:58:02Z", [0.4, 0.4, 0.18, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [79079, "2019-09-19T14:35:07Z", [0.07, 0.67, 0.26, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-09-19T13:31:32Z", [0.14, 0.64, 0.22, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [35217, "2019-09-19T13:01:51Z", [0.13, 0.51, 0.3, 0.06, 0.0], ""], [57797, "2019-09-19T03:27:54Z", [0.16, 0.55, 0.29, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [76730, "2019-09-18T18:23:10Z", [0.4, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1], ""], [30477, "2019-09-18T08:56:14Z", [0.03, 0.39, 0.49, 0.07, 0.02], ""], [83, "2019-09-18T05:39:30Z", [0.0, 0.52, 0.46, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [31756, "2019-09-18T05:27:09Z", [0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [172, "2019-09-17T19:27:06Z", [0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-09-17T10:37:52Z", [0.06, 0.64, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [36801, "2019-09-16T18:40:56Z", [0.15, 0.5, 0.2, 0.09, 0.06], ""], [29907, "2019-09-16T11:09:52Z", [0.11, 0.5, 0.37, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [29907, "2019-09-16T11:08:41Z", [0.08, 0.55, 0.37, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-15T09:06:27Z", [0.15, 0.49, 0.33, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-15T09:06:03Z", [0.11, 0.49, 0.37, 0.03, 0.0], ""], [14107, "2019-09-15T09:05:47Z", [0.08, 0.51, 0.37, 0.04, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-09-14T18:48:29Z", [0.09, 0.55, 0.3, 0.05, 0.01], ""], [57797, "2019-09-13T23:14:55Z", [0.02, 0.59, 0.37, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [41922, "2019-09-13T15:20:28Z", [0.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39718, "2019-09-12T21:21:36Z", [0.7, 0.26, 0.03, 0.01, 0.0], "Austria is a conservative country.
