It's almost as blue as South Carolina is red.  Additionally, Democrats seem to have successfully nationalized the election. Rather than the standard Democratic playbook of running an inoffensive campaign on the issues, they have taken a page from the Republican playbook and campaigned based on negative partisanship.

The racial demographic of VA is changing. \"When it comes to the race makeup of the population from 2010 to 2020, Virginia saw an 8% decline in the white population to 60.3%, a slight decline of the black population from 19.4% to 18.6%, an increase in the Asian population from 5.5% to 7.1%, and an increase in multiracial people from 2.9% to 8.2%. Those who identified as Hispanic or Latino, an ethnic group classified as being part of any race, increased from 7.9% to 10.5%.\"  Fundraising is also a bit lopsided ($21.2M to McAuliffe, and $7.2M to Youngkin (who has hit his own coffers as well). Will continue to watch and revisit as we approach the election. https://www.racetothewh.com/virginia\nhttps://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/first-look-2020-demographics-virginia/"], [1333, "2021-10-17T18:24:12Z", [0.05, 0.95, 0.0], ""], [37566, "2021-10-17T17:39:48Z", [0.51, 0.48, 0.01], ""], [58028, "2021-10-17T15:33:19Z", [0.66, 0.34, 0.0], ""], [45594, "2021-10-17T13:32:37Z", [0.4, 0.6, 0.0], ""], [102970, "2021-10-17T13:29:46Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [96828, "2021-10-17T12:11:00Z", [0.76, 0.24, 0.0], ""], [63401, "2021-10-17T11:46:12Z", [0.49, 0.51, 0.0], "Full disclosure.

Thus, voting for the Democratic candidate, who has is a know quantity as a former VA governor, would be voting to maintain the status quo and doesn't necessary represent future positive change.

VA has only \"trended bluer\" since then, especially in DC suburbs that were fairly proximate to the Jan 06 riot(s). That said, his initial victory came partly as a backlash to previous GOP Governor Bob McDonnell. And Biden's approval rating, tied to turnout/enthusiasm and the mood of Independents, is lower now than Obama's was in Oct 2013. Biden won the state in 2020 by \"only\" 10 pts. The change between Dem (V)POTUS candidates' winning margins in/since 2008 in various bluish-purple states (VA and upper-Midwest) and election results in the following year or two in Senatorial/Gubernatorial races has quite often been larger than 10 points, often 12-17.  Meanwhile, the change from 2016 to 2017 - Clinton winning by 4 points, to Northam winning by 9 - was much more modest. The Democratic party's coalition relies much more heavily on demographics that are less likely to turn out in midterms or \"off years\". It is only because the more highly-educated, higher-turnout voters have swung more towards Democrats in recent years (a vote swung being worth two in turnout) that McAuliffe still has the edge in my view. This seems to be reflected in polls that have him 1-4 points ahead of Youngkin, easily within the margin of error.
