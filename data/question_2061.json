Unlikely that any govt changes will impact on demand in the time period of the question. Winter is a period of low numbers of houses for sale but this doesn't mean low prices. However recent data (reinz reports) have shown increases from Aug to Dec of 8% in 2019 and 10% in 2020.

However, the real question is if we are going to the burst of housing prices in NZ. In an interview in about 4 years ago https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/201845436/steve-keen-the-coming-crash the economist Steve Keen predicted that there'll be a a recession in NZ in about 2 years time. So, I'd say there is a possibility here.  On the other hand, with Covid19, and stimulus packages that the government spends, re-opening of the economy which boosts the tourism in NZ the probability of a recession in the next 6 months is not high - I assign 1:2 (burst : not burst)\nFurthermore, according to investment manager Brian Gaynor in 2012, a 10% drop in house prices would wipe out $60 billion of New Zealanders' personal wealth; that's a huge amount, especially considering that NZ's GDP in 2019 was about 207 BUSD.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_property_bubble My guess is the government tries to contain the situation and take measures to cool the market down. If that will be a success, we have to see.
