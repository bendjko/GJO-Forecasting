The numbers may not be very accurate but they certainly suggest there will be some customer resistance. Nonetheless, we only need one paying passenger in the American flight on 29 December to answer the question. Updated & amended 20201122 Boeing are working 24/7 it appears to get B737 8/9 (MAX) back into the air. Clearly this is also motivated by the fact that a) they have around 450 unsold aircraft that cannot be sold until the upgrades are done and b) the company has around 370 customer aircraft stored that need to be changed. See https://reut.rs/3kSogBK The American announcement, highlighted by @Juliabizz looks like American is committed to that flight on 29 Dec 2020 As at 20201118: FAA has issued the Airworthiness Directive to start recertification process of the B737 MAX and thus rescinding the grounding order. This has been given along with the requirements for putting the aircraft back into service, both for commercial passenger and freight use.
