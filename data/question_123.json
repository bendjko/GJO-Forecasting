I added 10 to Trump in Indiana (assuming the numbers are actually low and Nate didn't already bump them up this morning) and added 20 to California (it's a month out, and Cruz is starting to look desperate and to quote the Donald - like a loser).

The alternative is a brawl at the convention, with no clear alternative (sorry Ted, no one likes you).  The party is becoming more and more concerned about down ballot votes, thus once again doesn't want a brawl.

Cruz won't be able to prevent Mr. Trump from getting to 1,237 delegates[5], lending some credence to Sam Wang's prediction of a final count of 1,284 delegates for Mr. Trump[6].

Combined with the New York results,2 that gives Trump 200 delegates since we issued the path-to-1,237 projections, five delegates ahead of his original targets\"[b].  But what about variance? That's a hard question. I estimated the standard deviation among the expert predictions to be 45[c]. (An estimate was necessary since the description of the individual predictions was pretty sketchy.) But that number is now a month out-of-date, and we don't have (to the best of my knowledge) an updated survey from which to work (not a publicly available one anyway). I'd guestimate that the variance is narrowing since there are now far fewer delegates in play, but I don't have any confidence in that idea, so let's go with the status quo ante. Here's the probability distribution:   1,237+ = 0.21\n1,200-1236 = 0.29\n1187-1199 = 0.11 \n1161-1186 = 0.19 \n1137-1160 = 0.11\nLess than 1137 = 0.09 Nothing's happened to change my mind since last time about the likely outcomes, which are 1,237+ \u2013> 0.99 (If Mr. Trump goes over 1,236, he\u2019s almost sure to win on the first ballot) \n1,200-1236 \u2013> 0.85 (If Mr. Trump is over 1,200, he\u2019s very likely to win on the first ballot) \n1187-1199 \u2013> 0.68 (If Mr. Trump is within 50 delegates, he\u2019s about a 2-to-1 favorite) \n1161-1186 \u2013> 0.50 (If Mr. Trump is in the upper 1,100s his chances to securing enough delegates are about even-money) \n1137-1160 \u2013> 0.25 (If Mr. Trump is this far away from 1,237 he\u2019ll look weak and wounded, and delegates will be much less likely to to be wooed) So the probability that Mr. Trump will win on the first ballot is 0.99*0.21+0.85*0.29+0.68*0.11+0.50*0.19+0.25*0.11+0*0.09 = 0.65. Applying my 0.05 fudge factor[d], that gives a forecast of 0.70. I suppose that this passes the laugh test, but I'm highly unsure about it - especially given my cluelessness regarding variance here. GIGO, I suppose. Another approach would have been to look at the estimated delegate outcomes in each of the remaining states and then look at how far Mr. Trump has been from his expected outcomes in states that have already had primaries, using the latter to estimate variance. That's more work than I have time for, sadly. It's also problematic since in many of the earlier primaries Mr Trump had more than 1-and-a-half opponents, as he will in the remaining primaries. So I guess I'm sticking with my guns until I can think of something better to do. -- [a] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/republicans/\n[b] http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-trumps-nomination-to-lose/\n[c] http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-donald-trump-clinch-the-republican-nomination-before-the-convention/\n[d] https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/210642"], [532, "2016-04-27T16:12:29Z", [0.94], ""], [254, "2016-04-27T16:06:31Z", [0.8], "Making big shift based on recent results by Trump."], [689, "2016-04-27T15:50:45Z", [1.0], ""], [20047, "2016-04-27T15:41:30Z", [0.65], ""], [19106, "2016-04-27T15:34:13Z", [0.95], "According to 538 Trump gets at least 35 of the unbound delegates in PA.

It leaves both looking  more like &, \"factually\" last night as  losers, again,  after their \"let's pull together\" questionable publicity campaign strategy. Forward looking result has a high probability  of a negative perception feedback loop for both? Too late, too disunited ? Expect DT to attempt turning this weak act into his strength. Once again, consensus mainstream media pushed the self serving ( misguided?)  narrative the past few weeks &, once again THIS TIME  another/different segment of the population spoke clearly. R.I., Pennsylvania, Conneticut, Delaware & Maryland are not the Deep South. Granted, NY was a DT territory but,  89/90 delegates was also a little surprising for most pundits.   For those, that have \"no particular bias\"  on who wins ( I recognize this a strange statement but consider - non US onlookers, those interested in the process, those that have a serious and v clear hope for Americans  to shine its light on the rest of the world, et cetera) the factual American message coming from the VOTING public of the GOP so far is very clear.  It is an serious odds w/ the established GOP status quo. One the one hand, there is a serious and powerful political \"Game Theory\" procedural machinations of the GOP elite whose purpose & intent is stop DT & his support base. At all costs. Including obfuscating the popular voting process if must be....last minute procedural issues...in Cleveland. On the other hand, those individuals that have a right to vote &, do so in the face of wrong footed narratives media serves up week after week, continue to make a v clear statement using DT as their pedestal: they want, they need &, they deserve a change. They don't want a Cruz, Kasich or some other last minute alternative. NB: voting % differentials b/w DT, TC & JK up & down the state board nomination process. Additionally, what is also clear is, in spite of all the \"dumb & worse\" stuff DT says about Muslims, Mexicans, Women &, the like his support base is actually broader ( much?)  than what pundits limit to poor WASP's ....would have its readers believe. Have noted w/ interest from this v well informed group of forecasters various projection updates. All v informative & imaginative. What's clear is, on present trends , post 7/6/16, a v high probability DT comes up short of the 1237 but, not be a large number. Flexibility, w/ an undertone of not underestimating DT is, what I expect from myself for rest of this process. At this stage, a 20% chance is justified on the above mentioned that DT fails to win the GOP nomination on the first ballot. In closing, the present  GOP process is reminiscent  somewhat of Salvador Dali's world of surrealism & shocking for impact. First, DT turns establishment status quo politics on its head. Second, GOP  goes into complete disarray willing to manipulate the - fundamental message - being served upon its door by its own voting public ( get rid of what we have now & they don't want a TC or JK by the way) by coming up w/ another alternative candidate using procedural variations that do not align w/ this message to seek out a \"better candidate having a chance to beat HC\". As Dali might surmise, a world in which one can no longer differentiate between fact and fiction. When faced w/ close to 1200 delegate votes being achieved by DT come Convention time, for the GOP to thereafter procedurally award the nomination to another participant ( new or otherwise) during the meat grinding process of would truly be surreal. The GOP has two options under such viable circumstances: a) come into line w/ the fundamental message being sent to it; or, b) find a not insignificant portion of its voter base dissalusioned in the first instance and, confirmed in the second instance - that Elite Status Quo politics has sold them down the river, again."], [14308, "2016-04-27T10:14:03Z", [0.75], ""], [14308, "2016-04-27T10:11:23Z", [0.55], ""], [19311, "2016-04-27T09:12:29Z", [0.65], "seems that Trump is actually ahead of expectations..."], [13239, "2016-04-27T07:55:21Z", [0.7], ""], [22690, "2016-04-27T07:28:29Z", [0.76], "Underestimated Trump again, although not by much this time so only have tweaks to make.

It's not that I didn't expect him to win; it's that I didn't expect him to win by such a significant margin. 90 out of 95 delegates? Reach for the smelling salts. Living oracle Nate Silver tells us that Trump's expected (mean) outcome is now 1,191 delegates[1]. Let's assume that the standard deviation is still 45 delegates. The result is the following probability distribution:  1,237+ = 0.16\n1,200-1236 = 0.26\n1187-1199 = 0.11\n1161-1186 = 0.20\n1137-1160 = 0.13\nLess than 1137 = 0.14 Nothing's happened to change my mind since last time about the likely outcomes, which are 1,237+ \u2013> 0.99 (If Mr. Trump goes over 1,236, he\u2019s almost sure to win on the first ballot)\n1,200-1236 \u2013> 0.85 (If Mr. Trump is over 1,200, he\u2019s very likely to win on the first ballot)\n1187-1199 \u2013> 0.68 (If Mr. Trump is within 50 delegates, he\u2019s about a 2-to-1 favorite)\n1161-1186 \u2013> 0.50 (If Mr. Trump is in the upper 1,100s his chances to securing enough delegates are about even-money)\n1137-1160 \u2013> 0.25 (If Mr. Trump is this far away from 1,237 he\u2019ll look weak and wounded, and delegates will be much less likely to to be wooed) So the new forecast is that there's a 0.58 [= (0.16*0.99)+(0.26*0.85)+(0.11*0.68)+(0.20*0.50)+(0.13*0.25)] chance that Mr. Trump will win the nomination on the first ballot.

Things now depend heavily on Pennysylvania, Indiana and California.\nI think his chances of getting clear to 1237 are something like 20% after NY. To get there he needs to win both Indiana and California (the latter by a landslide - or else picking up more delegates than expected in other states, which I put at definitely less than 50% chance, and perhaps even lower), and I give Trump only a 40% chance of winning Indiana. Since these are not likely to be independent I will take the higher estimate in the hopes of reducing the effect of a potential multi-stage fallacy, and say 20% I think I was being too pessimistic about Trump picking up unbound delegates. Sure his ground game has sucked so far, and Cruz in running rings around him with trojan delegates, but he only has to flip perhaps a quarter of unbound delegates to turn a near miss into 1237. And the expert models on 538 put his current trajectory at around 1190 delegates, just 47 short.  Given that the 54 unbound delegates in PA are more likely to feel they might need to support the state's winner, he may have more luck swinging them. If Trump wins PA, which 538 put at 94% chance if we average polls-only and polls-plus, I think there is a >99% chance he will get at least 30 unbound delegates (from PA and others), and a 75% chance he gets at least 50.  I made a spreadsheet which calculates these probabilities based on some assumptions https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9XMTgf2QMKfNUNISC1sc2hCcGs:\n- The probability Trump picks up a PA unbound delegate (given he wins PA) - I used 55% since 61 out of 110 Pa delegates said they will vote for the state winner.\n- The probability Trump picks up any other unbound delegate - I used 20%.\n- The total number of unbound delegates - I used 150. The results show > 99% chance of getting at least 40 unbound delegates given those assumptions, and >75% chance of getting 50, with the probabilities dropping off steeply after that (eg only 33% chance of getting >= 56). If Trump wins Indiana, he should get to about 1190. Even if he loses Indiana, if he overperforms in CA, he will get close to 1200. Let's take a normal distribution w average estimate of 1187, ie 50% chance of getting to ~1187, which gives us 0.94 * 0.75 * 0.5 chance of getting to 1237 that way.

It's no longer possible to consider this an elaborate April Fool's joke. So perhaps it's time to revisit the question. Why the drop in the consensus forecast? One of the more interesting and oft-repeated new stories of the last week or two has been about the fact that Sen. Cruz's campaign seems to be very good at navigating through the unspeakably confusing maze that is the Republican primary system[1], while Mr. Trump's campaign is almost criminally incompetent at doing so. It's good print, and there's certainly something to this[2][3][4]. Maybe all of this explains why a lot of smart people have been running away from the idea that we'll have a single ballot in Cleveland.  But it's worth being on one's guard too. First, forecasters tend to be clever, detail-oriented people, and our preference would probably be to fight a cretinous bully like Mr. Trump with our wits, rather than our fists. And that's not too far from what Sen. Cruz himself is doing. Since it's likely what we (or at I) would play a similar hand this way, we (or, again, I) could be overly confident about how likely that strategy is to succeed. The world sometimes rewards us for overconfidence[5], but not here I think. And not for Mr. Trump either[6], though that's a story for another time. (None of the foregoing should be taken to mean I'm a fan of Sen. Cruz. I'm not.) Second, the story fits nicely into the seasoned-politician-vs-outsider narrative to which many in the media have given voice again and again. So not only are we likely to overestimate the efficacy Sen. Cruz's approach; so too we are likely to have second- and third-helpings of stories about Sen. Cruz's gnome-like minions researching the likes and dislikes of some random librarian/Republican delegate in Baton Rogue in order to convince her to go with the Senator rather than the (supposed[7]) billionaire: \"Yes, Sen. Cruz shares your hatred for the recent adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, Ms. Gordon - may I call you Barbara? - and will have Ben H. Winters and Seth Grahame-Smith flayed alive in the Rose Garden.\" Okay, I made that one up, but you get the idea. But none of this means that Mr. Trump's got this locked up though. Far from it. The tricky bit is trying to quantify it all. What follows is a crude-but-not-crazy (I hope) attempt to do just that. The 9th level wizards over at FiveThirtyEight are currently offering a consensus projection that Mr. Trump will end up with 1,174 delegates after the last of the primaries is over[7]. That's great, but, dude, where's my variance? It's in another article. Sorta: \"[T]here was a somewhat bimodal distribution in the total number of delegates our respondents expected Trump to reach. Three of us have Trump earning from 1,136 to 1,156, and three have him winning from 1,237 to 1,244. (The other two respondents have him in the 1200s but short of 1,237\"[8]. Okay, that's better, but not perfect. The standard deviation is about 45 here. (I'm suppressing a bit of guess work that, as it turns out, doesn't have much impact on the outcome.) If so, Mr. Trump has a mere 8% chance of getting to 1,237 or higher. I repeat: 8%. That was a big surprise to me. And, on these assumptions, Mr. Trump has a only a 28% chance of getting over 1,200, the point at which some sources things he'd be close enough to get the nomination on the first ballot as the result of some pre-convention tinkering [9]. Other sources suggest that as long as he's within 50 delegates after California (38% likelihood), Mr. Trump will get the nomination on the first ballot[10]. The nice folks over at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics tell us, \"Only if Trump finishes 100 or more delegates short does the contested convention become a more prominent possibility,\"[11] and this little toy of a model I'm using predicts that there's a 79% that he will get at least 1,137.  On the basis of the above, I offer the following as a piecewise function taking us from the number of delegates that Mr. Trump eventually secures to the probability that he'll win on the first ballot. 1,237+ --> 0.99 (If Mr. Trump goes over 1,236, he's almost sure to win on the first ballot)\n1,200-1236 --> 0.85 (If Mr. Trump is over 1,200, he's very likely to win on the first ballot)\n1187-1199 --> 0.68 (If Mr. Trump is within 50 delegates, he's about a 2-to-1 favorite)\n1161-1186 --> 0.50 (If Mr. Trump is in the upper 1,100s his chances to securing enough delegates are about even-money)\n1137-1160 --> 0.25 (If Mr. Trump is this far away from 1,237 he'll look weak and wounded, and delegates will be much less likely to to be wooed)  As before, this is a crude approach, but if you think you can do better, then please tell me how because I'd love to learn a new trick or two. Anyway, from here it's pretty easy. Mr. Trump's chances of winning on the first ballot = (0.08*0.99)+(0.20*0.85)+(0.10*0.68)+(0.22*0.50)+(0.17*0.25)=0.47, with a little rounding up. That's remarkably close to the current consensus forecast! I guess I could have saved myself some time by going with it, but this was fun. I'm also adding 0.05 to counteract my biases I mentioned in the first few paragraphs.  Note: There's a lot of sloppiness above. Instead of a piecewise function, for instance, I should have fit a continuous curve and then integrated the function that describes it. But...you know...laziness. Plus, the results would not be that different, I think.  --- [0] https://www.gjopen.com/questions/123-will-the-republican-candidate-for-president-win-the-party-s-nomination-on-the-first-ballot-at-the-party-s-convention-in-july [1] http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/trump-likely-to-win-west-virginia-but-lose-delegates-222036 [2] http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-25/trump-holds-delegate-lead-but-cruz-maneuvers-to-outflank-him-at-convention [3] http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/13/ted-cruz-eyes-double-agent-delegates-in-bid-to-sna/ [4] http://time.com/4287932/donald-trump-ted-cruz-delegates/ [5] http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7364/full/nature10384.html%3FWT.ec_id%3DNATURE-20110915 [6] http://fortune.com/2015/08/07/donald-trump-leadership-lessons/ [7] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/29/the-myth-and-the-reality-of-donald-trumps-business-empire/ [8] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/can-you-get-trump-to-1237/ [9] http://fortune.com/2016/02/26/delegate-math-republican-nomination/ [10] http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/14/can-trump-hit-1237-4-things-to-watch-for/ [11] http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/assessing-trumps-path-to-1237/"], [3457, "2016-04-18T15:09:42Z", [0.43], ""], [8226, "2016-04-18T15:06:19Z", [0.65], ""], [14777, "2016-04-18T12:54:22Z", [0.58], ""], [24029, "2016-04-18T12:10:10Z", [0.33], ""], [19106, "2016-04-18T09:12:57Z", [0.34], "I think I was discounting too much Trump's chances of swaying unbound delegates.

Of the roughly four ways a second ballot could be prevented, one could beat him even if he has a majority going in:  the Credentials Committee. If you stack that committee properly, it can disallow the credentials of the Trump diehards on some pretext or other.  This would require a majority on the floor to support such an action, but remember that not all delegates pledged to Grump on first are his supporters, and nobody is pledged to vote a particular way on Credentials, Platform, or Rules questions. So the party regulars who are designated for Trump could vote to disqualify their ostensible teammates.  You\u2019d need to have some alternates available, but not a big problem.  The other three approaches require him not to have a majority coming in, as far as I can tell.  Next would be Platform Committee, which could if it felt like it write an actual Republican Party platform, leaving out all of his crazoid stuff and sternly denouncing anybody who holds more extreme positions.  If you handle it right, he\u2019ll quit in a huff.  This is tricky, because nobody ever feels bound by the platform and he has recently acquired some advisors who actually know this.  However, if the draft contains language that is pretty clearly insulting to him, he might walk out.  This could perhaps work even if he comes in with a majority, if he either explicitly withdraws or you jigger the rules so his pledged delegates can\u2019t vote for him; e.g., by not allowing his name to be placed before the body for some reason you could make up. Third is Rules Committee.  Rule 40 is an obvious target, even though the only nearly realistic beneficiary would be Kasich.  I haven\u2019t looked at Republican convention rules in many years, but the odds are excellent there are some others that could be modified, repealed, or introduced that would lock him out on first.  Having control of Rules would also facilitate some of the other shenanigans herein contemplated.  That one and Method Four certainly require agreement on a new Anointed One. Method Four is a raw preconvention deal.  Cruz has been kissing up to Rubio, and together they right now have almost as many delegates as Hair Boy.  With Kasich and the Uncommittteds and a few others, they\u2019d have more.  If it looks like he won\u2019t have a majority, the poohbahs, if they can pick a winner, might be able to arrange a first-ballot win. Knitting together some combination of these might indeed lock him out.  All of this is the longest of shots, but very enjoyable to contemplate.  Still most likely as far as I can see is that he arrives with a majority and\u2014perhaps after a couple of floor fights\u2014wins on first ballot.   The Republican Party then goes the way of the buffalo: nearly extinct for a very long time, and gradually inching back.  Sorry this is so long.

My forecast was already going along the lines of the forecast made by @Pythagoras who ended at a 0.84 probability.  I merely expand on the analysis there to arrive at my own number. I have no reason to dispute the 0.68 of Trump securing all the necessary delegate votes to secure the nomination and instead look at the remaining 0.32. While Pythagoras divides the possible outcomes within the 0.32 to 2 outcomes I believe there are actually 3 outcomes because of the players involved and motivations. Those 3 outcomes within the 0.32 space are: Outcome 1: No candidate secures enough delegates to win the first ballot.\nOutcome 2: A candidate uses any means to secure enough delegates to win the first ballot.\nOutcome 3: The GOP leadership/convention rules committee comes up with a first ballot victor. Given the attention that conventions receive in the modern political age when convention location, timing, and agenda is all manipulated for maximum results and coverage, and especially in this tumultuous season, I believe the third outcome is a potential alternative independent of whatever efforts are taken by the candidates themselves in pursuit of their own interests.  The party may wish to minimize the coverage of a disputed nomination and at least attempt to converge behind a candidate at the last minute rather than give additional fuel to the party split narrative that will exist.  Part of this third scenario may be rallying behind Trump or Cruz through superdelegates and/or rule changes, or it might be a bold move to name a new candidate but do so with rule changes in the first ballot to again build that single party candidate narrative.  I could attempt to assign probabilities within those two scenarios but they ultimately end in the same third outcome of a first ballot win but motivated not by a candidate. Also in line with Pythagoras not being able to discern between those outcomes in the 0.32 space, I'll also give them equal weighting.  Since two of them result in a first ballot win, I arrive at 0.8933 (0.68 + (0.32 / 3 * 2))"], [21853, "2016-04-04T17:03:52Z", [0.55], ""], [484, "2016-04-04T16:39:46Z", [0.8], "(no change) Talk of not changing rule 40 reduces chance of an open convention."], [13360, "2016-04-04T16:32:39Z", [0.55], ""], [16650, "2016-04-04T16:28:25Z", [0.33], "Looking much less likely that he'll secure 1,237.

Trump is currently at 751 (based on Frontloading HQ blog).  I think 238 delegates remain to be allocated from states with some degree of proportional allocation (I did not double-check my count, caveat lector!). I assume for simplicity that each candidate wins 1/3. This would take Trump to 830 (convenient!).  A balance of 407 bound delegates would be needed from WTA states. I believe there are 573 available (again, not double-checked). Loss of CA (172 delegates) would substantially reduce the probability Trump hits a majority. CA primary is a looong way away, so it is difficult to have confidence in any forecast. Qualitatively, Cruz is likely to perform well among religious conservatives and, if Kasich is still viable, he may also become a focal point for moderate Republicans who don't want Trump but don't want Cruz either. I will assume for now that CA is a three-way toss-up.  Conditional on Trump winning CA, he still must win multiple key states. NJ and PA (122 combined) seem probable for Trump, although again it is very early. It is plausible that, if Kasich remains viable, he would have a similar impact as described above. I am purely guessing that Trump will appeal to the anti-establishment types in MT (27) and WV (34). That total would still be short by 52 delegates. It seems plausible that Trump might win the additional 1-3 states required to pass the hurdle, but it does not seem like a given. Bottom line is that the probability of Trump hitting a majority seems much more sensitive to key events (namely California and whether or not Kasich drops out) than at the time of my original forecast. I will say roughly 5% probability of Trump securing a delegate majority, conditional on losing CA (67% probability) and roughly 50% probability conditional on winning CA (33%).

The four took issue with a rule. . .  requiring a candidate to win a majority of delegates in eight states to be eligible for the party\u2019s nomination \u2014 a threshold only Trump has exceeded so far. If preserved, the rule could block John Kasich or Ted Cruz from competing with Trump at the convention. . .  \"If the committee scraps the requirement entirely, it could open the door to multiple candidates, possibly even some who never entered the primaries, competing for the party\u2019s nomination at a brokered convention. And even a lower threshold would make it easier for Trump\u2019s rivals to challenge him.\n. . . \n\"If Trump doesn\u2019t effectively clinch the Republican nomination by the June 7 end of the primary season, the rules committee is destined to be the epicenter of political wrangling and horse-trading leading up to what would be the first contested convention since 1976. \" . . . Eventually, the committee will include a man and a woman from every state and U.S. territory \u2014 a total of 112 people. But interviews with the four members, as well as two veteran Republicans who hope to join the panel, provide an early window into the factors that could drive the committee\u2019s decision-making. Though the panel is imbued with virtually unchecked power to draft rules that tip the nomination away from Trump \u2014 or into his grasp \u2014 most of the panelists and prospective members indicated their actions would be guided by a different principle: caution. \u201cWe don't want to give the impression that we are leaning one way or the other in support or trying to hold somebody else back,\u201d . . .\u201cFundamentally, I hope we keep the way we\u2019re doing it,\u201d said Ross Little Jr., a rules committee member from Louisiana. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for a gigantic change.\u201d\n. . .\n\"Members of the rules panel are aware that any changes to the process that lower barriers for Trump\u2019s competitors \u2014 even adjustments to the eight-state rule \u2014 could be seen as an affront to the front-runner.\u201cAny proposed change will be viewed as to which candidates would be helped and which candidates would be hurt. It\u2019s a classic example of changing the rules in the middle of the game,\u201d \u201cIt would be widely and correctly viewed as that outrageous power grab.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Trump has already groused about Cruz\u2019s efforts to elect his supporters as delegates to the national convention, a dynamic that could create challenges for Trump on the rules committee, as well as on the floor of the convention, if he\u2019s unable to secure the nomination beforehand. . . . any sudden rules changes could create a public relations headache for the committee\n. . . \n\"Veteran national Republican committeeman Curly Haugland is the lone exception to the light-touch approach. He was on the rules committee in 2012 and said he intends to pursue a slot this year as well. Haugland has for years insisted that delegates to the national convention cannot be restricted from voting their conscience. Currently, delegates are bound to vote on a first ballot according to the results of the contest in their state. But if no nominee is selected, most are free to shift their support on later ballots. Haugland, however, argues that delegates are elected by fellow Republicans to exercise judgment on the convention floor, and should be free to vote as they please even on the first ballot. He said he intends to persuade the rules committee \u2014 as well as the convention delegates writ large \u2014 to enact changes that would allow delegates to vote for any candidate who has earned a delegate in the 2016 voting.\n. . . \n\" . . . Haugland is unlikely to find much help in his quest. Freeing delegates would invalidate the months-long election season that all three campaigns have battled relentlessly to win. \u201cI would not favor changing the rules regarding binding\u201d delegates to follow their state\u2019s voters on the first ballot, said [committee member] Wheeler. \u201cThat is a core concept of how we arrive at our delegates and how we translate the votes of the people to the nominee.\u201d\n. . .\n\u201cRight now, I don\u2019t want the scandal of a [sweeping] change in the rules,\u201d [committee member] Blackwell said. \u201cWhomever we nominate will be more likely to win if we haven\u2019t had a significant element in the party claiming that the rules have been changed to favor one candidate or oppose one candidate.\u201d\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  If the candidate doesn't win on the first round, it could be a very  contentious convention.  I'd read Haugland's opinion before, but had no idea how to weigh it; knowing that his ideas are not supported by many others and that the early delegates are taking a cautious approach, makes me lean a bit more towards an un-contested convention, however, with Cruz working so hard to accumulate delegates in the hopes of throwing open the convention, I'm not going to go very high."], [4634, "2016-03-31T18:28:37Z", [0.62], ""], [10759, "2016-03-31T18:28:30Z", [0.62], ""], [484, "2016-03-31T18:22:26Z", [0.8], "Up 20% but agree that DT may have some tough sledding to reach the right number of delegates.

He could even get over 50% in NY, if he gets a big home state boost, giving him all the NY delegates. He needs 60% of the delegates from here on to get to 1237, but due to the non-proportional nature of most of the remaining primaries, that looks like it could be possible with just a plurality.

Until now, I had assumed that *only* the following states of nature were salient: State 1: Some candidate wins at least 1,237 of the delegates by the last primary, and the nomination goes, in the first ballot, to that candidate.\nState 2: No candidate wins at least 1,237 of the delegates after the last primary, and no candidate wins the nomination in the first ballot at the convention. Not so! There is a period of about 6 weeks between the last primary (June 7) and the convention (July 18) during which candidates can lobby delegates. So, to take one example, Mr. Trump might fall short of 1,237 delegates in early June but still secure enough delegates before July 18 in order to be nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland. Put another way, there are really 3, not 2, salient states of nature: State 1: Some candidate wins at least 1,237 of the delegates by the last primary, and the nomination goes, on the first ballot, to that candidate.\nState 2: No candidate wins at least 1,237 of the delegates after the last primary, and no candidate wins the nomination on the first ballot.\nState 3: No candidate wins at least 1,237 of the delegates after the last primary, but some candidate secures enough delegates - by hook or by crook - before the convention to be nominated on the first ballot. As before, I assign a probability of 0.68 to State 1, with Mr. Trump (ca. 0.98) being far more likely than Senator Cruz (ca. 0.02) to be the victor, should we find ourselves in this state. And I am increasingly convinced that this process will go down to the wire though[b]. (This fact has relevance for the GJ question about when Senator Cruz will drop out: He probably won't!)  That leaves a probability space of 0.32 for the disjunction of States 2 and 3. I honestly have no idea how to divide up this probability space, so I'm going to fall back on the principle of insufficient reason and just cut the damn thing in half. I think we'll have a better idea soon, but it's just too early to make anything more accurate than a stab in the dark. By the way, if I were a member of the #nevertrump Republican elite, I'd be working very hard to make sure that the people who are selected as delegates[c] are not the sort who are easily swayed by the prospect of gold-plated steaks[d] or whatever you kids are into these days. On a side note, if Mr. Trump cannot secure the nomination during the pre-convention stage (should it come to that), I think he enters the convention considerably weakened. His schtick is that he's a \"master negotiator\"[e]. But if he gets about 1,100 delegates and still can't seal the deal during the six-week pre-convention, then the bloom's off the rose.  Anyway, I now estimate the current probability that a candidate will be successfully nominated on the first ballot to be 0.84 (=0.68+(0.32/2)). -- [a] http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-11/republicans-new-target-the-pre-convention [b] http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-important-states-on-trumps-path-to-1237-delegates/ [c] https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ [d] https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&dat=19491201&id=PtEKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FFADAAAAIBAJ&pg=3186,1095855&hl=en [e] http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-negotiation-money-golf-2015-10"], [823, "2016-03-22T13:59:26Z", [0.85], ""], [691, "2016-03-22T12:48:55Z", [0.78], "Trump could come in 50-100 delegates short.

The key to this question (obviously) is how well DT does over next couple weeks.

Winner-take-all, mostly at the congressional district level. There haven't been any polls since December; at that point the totals were 25% Cruz, 23% Trump and 1% Kasich. That would put Trump close to where he needs to be, though dropouts since (Rubio/Carson/Paul had combined for 28%) probably move more support to Cruz than Trump in my view. \n- Arizona (58/58).

Trump is at 45% in a recent poll, Kasich 18% and Kruz 11%. Even assuming Rubio's support largely goes to Kasich, there's a chance Trump tops 50% and takes everything.  \n- Indiana (51/57). Winner-take-all, mostly at the congressional district level. No recent polling, but Trump won Michigan, Illinois and Kentucky. Kasich won Ohio to the East and was competitive in Michigan. Cruz was competitive in every bordering state other than Ohio. I think Trump takes most of the state, but 51 delegates is iffy. \n- New Jersey (51/51). Winner-take-all. In a February poll, Trump was at 33.3%, Rubio/Carson combined for 25.4%, with Cruz at 7.7% and Kasich at 4.3%. Nearly a lock for Trump, unless the dropout delegates universally go to his rivals. \n- Pennsylvania (40/71) 17 delegates are winner-take-all, the rest go in a \"loophole\" primary.

Kasich is a nice guy who won in his home state, but that's not going to get him to the top of the ticket. (I continue to believe that Kasich is running for VP, and would probably get it if the GOP nominated someone other than The Donald. But alas . . .) Here's what's coming up for Team R: 3/22: \nAZ (58)- DT ahead significantly per Nate Silver.\nUT (40)- A bit of a wild card. First, I can't find any recent polls. Older polls suggest that Trump was about even with Rubio and Cruz. Second, I have to imagine that Utah's republican party consists mostly of Mormons, and that the LDS church probably has an opinion about Trump even if they haven't shared it publicly. My guess is that they're turned off by his vulgarity and will probably vote for Cruz. Finally: \"Utah's 40 Republican delegates will be awarded through caucus meetings and an online vote of registered Republicans. If a candidate claims more than 50 percent, he'll take them all; otherwise the delegates will be awarded proportionately.\" http://www.sltrib.com/home/3668321-155/tuesdays-results-mean-donald-trump-more Very few R candidates have scored above 50% so far, even when they have won a state, and Kasich is still technically in the race. My guess is that Cruz wins, but not strongly enough for an outright win of all the delegates.   4/5:\nWI (42)- No recent polls, but DT was ahead in older polls. Not really evangelical territory, and it's winner-take-most. Probably a strong win for Trump, 4/19: \nNY (95)- winner-take most unless a candidate gets >50%, then winner-take-all. Gotta think DT gets most if not all delegates here. 4/26: \nCT (28), DE (16), MD (38), PA (71), RI (19)-Most states here are winner-take-all or winner-take-most. Probably a good day for Trump. 5/3: \nIN (57)- Hard to say. If Kasich has any momentum, they might go for him because he is the next-door governor. But otherwise this is probably Trump country with lots of unhappy white blue-collar voters and not too many evangelicals. Winner-take-most, so if I had to guess, I'd say Trump wins again. 5/10: \nNE (36)- NE is winner-take-all and probably follows KS and goes for Cruz.\nWV (34)- Trump definitely takes WV.  5/17:\nOR (28)- See CA below. 5/24:\nWA (44)- See CA below. Also note that it is roughly proportional, but with weird rules. See http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/WA-R 6/7:\nNJ (51)- Winner-take-all, Trump wins. (Otherwise he'll do something unspeakable to Chris Christie.)\nNM (24)- See CA below.\nMT (27)- Winner-take-all. See CA below.\nSD (29)- I have no idea.\nCA (172)- Winner-take-most. The west coast is the big enchilada, primarily because of CA. I think if trump wins CA he'll probably also win most of the western states and then Ted Cruz is well and truly done. On the other hand, I think if Cruz does well in western states he probably comes out with enough delegates to keep Trump under 1,237 and possibly enough to be within shouting distance of him, particularly if he can get some Kasich or Rubio delegates publicly pledged to him at some point. (The mechanics of that process are quite murky.) I think that in any scenario Trump comes into the convention with more delegates than anyone else, but the question is how much more. If it's not close, the GOP won't want to be seen as taking away the candidate that the voters have chosen. If it is close, they might be willing to risk a brokered convention, although I think they will always be reluctant to take that option because there is absolutely no way for them to control that process and it could easily turn into a huge mess on national TV.  the bottom line for me is that for there to be any chance of a brokered convention, Cruz has to do well, possibly even very well, in the western states. I'll go from 95% to 90% because Cruz has done a little better than I expected.

I've been at 100% since the day this IFP was published (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/99433) and I have no intention of backing away from that anytime soon.

In the thread I linked to above, I showed that there really haven't been any \"contested\" conventions that we can look to when trying to form a base-rate for forecasting on this IFP, but I did come across an article that might help those who are being persuaded by the siren song of the illusion that is the contested convention.

For those of you who read my forecasts, I usually edit out the extraneous parts, but I think that the whole article helps to paint the picture that, a contested convention is NOT in the interest of the GOP (did you see the protests in Chicago tonight?!) and that there are ways for a candidate to get to 1237 (before) the convention, even after all the states have cast ballots in primaries.\n~ Mar 11: \"Republicans' New Target: The 'Pre-Convention'\" --> http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-11/republicans-new-target-the-pre-convention The Republican delegate tangle has people talking excitedly about a contested national convention this summer. Not so fast. Even if no candidate wins the necessary 1,237 delegates by the end of primaries and caucuses on June 7, the six weeks that follow provide another opportunity to settle the matter before the party gathers in Cleveland on July 18. I\u2019ll call this period the \u201cpre-convention.\u201d Republicans can't have an undecided convention without first passing through a contested pre-convention period. With all the delegates chosen but no candidate having a secure majority, the action will shift from the week-to-week slog from one state primary to the next in search of voters to a collective decision to be made by the delegates: 2,472 party actors, most of them obscure but a handful well known, most of them loyal to the candidate they are supporting but many of them with other interests and preferences. If no one has the nomination locked up in June, everyone involved -- candidates, delegates and other party actors -- will feel intense pressure to get this done before the convention. The purpose of national conventions today is advertising for the party and its candidate, and that opportunity would be forfeited if the convention was convened without a nominee. The worst case would be day after day of deadlock under the full gaze of the national media with controversies heating up and plenty of chances for those 2,472 delegates (and the hundreds of other Republicans who will be in attendance) to make the party and whomever they eventually settle on look bad. So the campaigns will scramble to win the allegiance of delegates, both those who are not tethered to a particular candidate and those who are, since bound delegates might become available if the convention decides to let them vote however they want.   Delegates who are unbound and uncommitted won\u2019t necessarily wait until Cleveland to commit. As some of them declare for a candidate (and are added to the tallies news organizations keep), the delegate counts will change as the convention approaches. A candidate could go over the top during those six weeks. The lead could change. What happens during the pre-convention will depend partly on how close the front-runner is to 1,237 delegates, and on how big the gap is between him and the second-highest vote-getter.  Party actors, including delegates, may care which candidate has won the final contests, including some in big states like California, as well as what the national polls are saying. Even if they haven't publicly committed to a candidate, some party leaders may contact delegates to discuss a course of action, and even push some contenders to step aside in favor of someone who has a chance to wrap up the nomination early. Most Republican delegates will have been chosen as \u201cbound,\u201d meaning they would be required to vote for a certain candidate on at least the first ballot in Cleveland. A small number will be chosen as \u201cuncommitted,\u201d meaning they could choose to support any candidate before the convention, or change allegiance from one to another. Another batch of delegates -- anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred -- will have been selected to be delegates for a candidate who has withdrawn. Depending on their state party rules, some will be bound to support their candidate anyway, at least on the first ballot. Others will be free to choose. Even some of those who are pledged to vote for a candidate who is still running could conceivably be in play. Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans in many states separate the selection of the individual delegates from the allocation of how they are supposed to vote on the first ballot for a given candidate. This means many delegates could be bound to vote for a candidate despite not actually supporting him. For example, Donald Trump won the Virginia primary on March 1 and was allocated 17 of Virginia\u2019s 49 delegates. Separately, Virginia Republicans are holding a series of party conventions in April and May in each of the state's congressional districts to select the actual delegates. Seventeen of those delegates will be assigned to Trump, and under the tentative rules they will have to vote for Trump on the first ballot in Cleveland. But there\u2019s nothing in the rules to guarantee Trump is the actual preference of those 17 people. This means that even a candidate who has captured 1,237 delegates by June 7 might not be truly safe. It's unclear if Republicans would be willing to thwart the will of their voters by upending a chosen winner, but if the delegates want to, nothing can stop them. This too is a fight that could start during the pre-convention. Unfortunately, we have little historical precedent for how this jockeying works in practice. It\u2019s possible that well-organized campaigns will have been able to secure their choices for delegates and that poorly organized campaigns will have had less success. By the pre-convention period, one or more candidates might have a real advantage in the share of their delegates who are truly loyal. So not only are the rules confusing and subject to interpretation. They're also subject to change. The tentative rules for the convention bind all delegates to vote the way they were allocated on the first ballot, but the convention can change those rules. So we may be in for a convention floor fight about whether to \u201cfree\u201d the delegates to vote how they choose. If so, the first rounds of that fight and any other rules fight will take place in the pre-convention period, when the convention Rules Committee is chosen and begins its deliberations. Another possibility: fights in the convention credentials committee about any disputes over who the properly elected delegates might be. In the old days of brokered conventions, party bosses chose delegates who would do as they were instructed. Today\u2019s delegates have far more leeway to do what they want. So if, for example, Marco Rubio drops out after losing Florida on Tuesday and endorses Cruz, the delegates he has won so far wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to listen to him or anyone else. And efforts to win commitments from those delegates would hardly wait until the convention.   However uncharted the period is between the end of the primaries and the beginning of the convention, if no one reaches 1,237 by June 7 then party actors will press hard to get everything resolved before everyone arrives in Cleveland. If they\u2019re successful, the convention won\u2019t appear to have been contested after all. If not?

What may matter more to his campaign is whether Kasich wins or loses Ohio. Ironically a Trump win would make it easier to make up the difference because Kasich would very likely drop out. Cruz would then be chasing his delegate lead, and would need to win 60% of the vote from there out to get to 1237.

Trump had a bad night.\nGiven Trump currently has the most delegates, this increases the odds that nobody makes it to 1237.   Still, Trump came away from today still on track to make the nomination. 538 have his target total at this point in the race as 366 delegates. He will likely win 49 delegates yesterday - 10 below the target pace of +59 in today's contest, but for a total of 387 or 5.7% above his target total. If Trump's poor performance is the sign if a shift in support then the chances of his current position being enough to win a majority go down significantly though.  Even more importantly, if Rubio were to pull out then Cruz would be head to head against Trump - a nice situation for Cruz in many of the winner-take-all states. However Rubio will stay in at least until Florida.   There are really two considerations then:\n1. What are the odds Trump gets to 1237?\n2. What are the odds Cruz gets to 1237? For 1, I believe that Trump needs to win in both winner-take-all states Florida and Ohio in order to get to majority.  I have predicted he has an 0.89 chance in FL and a 0.35 chance in Ohio (both of these are adjusted for tonights' results though i will move them again, particularly Florida, when i see some more polls post this result).  So the chance Trump wins both of these is only 31% (actually just multiplying is a bit cheeky as it assumes independence, which is almost certainly somewhat wrong). And if he loses one, he would need to win massive majorities of votes in the proportional states to make it up, which I put at basically no chance (Trump has a ceiling as well as a floor!). So there is a 69% chance Trump doesn't make the 1237. \nPreviously I was giving Trump a generous probability (.75) of turning a Super Tuesday win into a majority part of this was based on the assumption that momentum was on his side. With that now not the case, I think I believe the number above more. For Cruz, what is his path to majority? Is there one? He too would need to win Florida, which is basically no chance with Rubio in the race, and with the FL primary only a a bit over a week away, I don't think there's really any chance that Rubio drops out before it. I'll be generous and give Cruz a 1% chance of getting to majority. So that's a 68% chance that nobody has a delegate majority going into the convention.

Trump appears to be on track to win a considerable share of the ~750 delegates between today and March 15. The key question is whether the gap to the majority could be closed based solely on \"hitting the board\" in future primaries that allocate proportionally. In that case, it is difficult for me to see how an establishment-led push against Trump could deny him a majority.

The conditional I had, of Trump emerging from Super Tuesday with a delegate lead, has occurred. But I think my odds (80%) for Trump turning that lead into a majority were too high. I also think that the outcome of Super Tuesday - Cruz winning many more delegates than Rubio, putting Cruz in 2nd place, but with Cruz's strong states mostly already past and Rubio's yet to come - meaning it will be hard for either of them to gain a majority. The most likely outcome now is, in decending order: \n- a Trump majority (I think this is >50% likely)\n- a Trump plurality (and thus a contested convention)\n- Rubio somehow turns it around and scrapes a majority (seems highly unlikely now)\n- Cruz somehow obtains a majority (basically zero chance) This outcome is likely to affect the Republican strategy in a way that makes a contested convention significantly more likely. Because their last remaining likely strategy now is to just try and stop Trump from getting to 1267 delegates.\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/rubio_cruz_and_kasich_will_all_stay_in_the_gop_race_why.html So I think that they will be trying to make it harder for Trump to run away with things than if it were in a head to head (which would have been all or nothing but still held some chance of one of the others getting to a majority). The NYT has sketched out the two opposing scenarios - the one that leads to Trump winning a majority, and one that denies him the majority (but nobody else gets one either). http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/27/upshot/republican-delegate-calculator-how-trump-can-win.html The probability of Trump getting a majority is the key calculation then. If I fiddle with the calculator here, http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/02/us/super-tuesday-results-delegates.html just putting Trump at 37% support, which is the weighted average calculated by FiveThirtyEight at the moment, would see him easily win a majority. And his national poll numbers have been trending up. This gives me more confidence in my 80% chance of a majority estimate, and in fact that almost seems too low given the state of things (no clear second place after Super Tuesday - so it will not turn into a one-on-one race soon). However I think I will give Trump only a 75% chance of obtaining a majority because I think the strategies of all the other candidates will now shift to simply attempting to prevent him from getting to 1267. And I think I give only a 1% chance of either Cruz or Rubio winning a majority (I think the chance is nearly zero if one of them doesn't drop out very soon, and I put that chance at ~1%).

My view here is that if it were possible to force a brokered convention, the establishment would do it (chaos for the party, or no).  I simply do not believe it is possible for them to stop Trump's nomination at this point.   First, some #'s to frame it up:  \nTo win on 1st ballot, DT needs 1,237 of 2,472 (50% + 1)\nTo date, The Donald, has 82 out of 133 delegates awarded thus far (62%). \nTonight, we get 624 more of which he only \"needs\" 246 to stay on track.  However he is ahead in every state but TX, and I'd be floored if he does not get more. See here:\nhttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/march1GOP.html\n And here:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/25/donald-trump-needs-to-win-only-39-percent-of-super-tuesday-delegates-to-stay-on-pace-to-be-the-gop-nominee/ There are then several more proportional contests in next 2 wks w/ total of 356 add'l delegates.  The Donald is similarly doing well in many of these states, and there is no reason to think he will not get huge slugs of these delegates.   624 + 326 = 950.  I think there are probably reasonable arguments that depending on how the chips fall, Trump may come away with anywhere between 30 and 70% of these delegates (depends on if Cruz can lock up TX, etc).  Regardless, he is VERY likely to lead any of the other candidates in delegates, although I'd grant that whether he remains \"on track\" to avoid a contested convention w/ >50% of the delegates or not is an open question.   Depending on how those states fall, he will come into March 15th with ~40-60% of the delegates that have been awarded (and ~1/2 of the R delegates will have been awarded by that point).  Starting on March 15th, the states change from being largely proportional to being predominantly \"winner take all,\" and 1,266 delegates remain to be awarded.  Other candidates running have certain advantages in individual states (Kasich in Ohio and Rubio in FL), but Trump is leading in virtually all of these late states (incl in FL & OH actually - see realclearpolitics link above).   The key question here is will the non-trump vote be able to consolidate and win >50% of these late states, or not.  Winning just a few (OH, FL, etc) is not nearly good enough, they need to deny him more than 1/2 of the late states or he will hit his number and be able to win on the 1st vote at convention.  To do that, you can be sure R establishment will apply immense pressure to get candidates who cannot win to drop out (Carson ASAP, and Kasich/Rubio after they contest OH/FL respectively (presumably keeping the one that wins.  If they both win & want to stay in, that might be worse case scenario).  Cruz may keep puttering along.  I think his remaining voters would probably break away from Trump more than for them, but It's not really in Cruz's personality to drop out, and it is clear he does not care if the establishment hates him, so there is nothing to hang over his head.  In 2 weeks, we'll probably have experienced 2 more weeks like the last one (absolutely withering attacks on Trump from all quarters.  Split, proportional votes in most states, most candidates with exception of maybe Carson staying in the race).  At that point, will Rubio, Kasich, or Cruz alone have higher support than Trump in a majority of the remaining states??  Can Trump's negatives be driven up high enough to put a dent in his support and/or can the establishment successfully rally nearly EVERY non-Trump primary voter around just one other person?    If they could assemble that coalition, will that person be able to run the tables in the late states and thus provide the R's with a non-Trump uncontested convention?   I do not think it is at all likely Trump can be stopped, but I'm not positive.  In my view, he has too many voters committed to him, and it is too late in the game to change those voters minds.  I'd put it at 90-10 in terms of outcomes.  If he were stopped, it's probably because something HUGE comes out that causes voters to re-evaluate.  If they do, it's probably real bad, and he probably stops winning states.  If that happens, can someone else coalesce support, or does vote splinter between Cruz-Rubio-Kasich?  I don't know, but I'd say at least 50-50 that it coalesces around one.     Thus overall, I'll put it at 95-5 on this (90 Trump, 5 someone else, 5 contested), vs. 80-20 consensus.  We'll see after Super Tuesday and maybe a few more of these proportional voting dates whether the negative assault from party R's seems to have any impact on his support."], [11885, "2016-03-01T20:18:58Z", [0.98], ""], [20875, "2016-03-01T20:06:46Z", [0.89], ""], [2965, "2016-03-01T18:50:08Z", [0.98], "Fuzzy thinking and last gasp scenarios did  not help Scranton in 64.\nMuch more democratic process today."], [18605, "2016-03-01T18:48:28Z", [0.75], ""], [2, "2016-03-01T18:48:12Z", [0.7], "Moving up from 60%.

Assume every 100 years gives 4% chance. However the rules around primaries were changed in the 70s, may help reduce the chance of there not being a clear winner. For a non-conclusive vote there would have to be a couple of events - first, no candidate with a clear majority before the convention, and second, no clear winner emerging from the behind-the-scenes horse trading before the first vote.  Back in December Nate Silver guesstimated that there was a 20% chance of a brokered convention. \nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republican-brokered-convention-donald-trump/ That seems too high to me, especially now that there is a real chance trump simply runs away with the nomination and is actually able to secure > 50% of delegates outright.' If Trump doesn't secure 50% of delegates before the convention, I would give an almost 100% chance that the first vote does not select a clear winner. So really this question is about: can Trump secure > 50% of delegates? This is looking increasingly likely. I give him 95% odds of emerging from Super Tuesday with the most delegates (though likely not a majority of those awarded thus far). That can create a bandwagon effect, leading to even better results subsequent. However the field may also winnow after Super Tuesday - if it turned into a head-to-head race between Trump and Rubio I'd expect things to get considerably harder for him. I think I give trump a ~85%  chance of pulling ahead to a clear majority after a super tuesday lead, and a 5% chance someone else gets there. And I think I give Rubio only a ~50% chance of closing the gap and getting to a delegate majority in the case he comes out ahead after super tuesday (which I put at 4% chance), and no chance anyone else does. And though I think it unlikely Cruz can get to a delegate lead at Super Tuesday (1%) I give him a 10% chance of turning that into a majority, and a 5% chance someone else does. So that gives us a .15*.95 + .5*.04+.85*.01 =17.1% probability of nobody with a delegate majority by the convention. And I'll give a 98% weight to the first vote being inconclusive should that happen, so we have ~17% chance. The question is for the converse, so 83%.

First, the outside view: the last Republican convention with more than one ballot was in 1948. The last Republican convention that was very close to be brokered was in 1976. So odds are largely against a brokered convention.  This in means that in modern elections (with primaries or caucauses used in all states) the voters tend to decide on the victory  (defined as 50% +1  of the delegates) of a single candidate during the primaries being the convention most of the times a mere pro-forma. \n\nThe 2016 Republican race seems no exception, in  spite of the many candidates running.  Trump is ahead, collecting most of the delegates so far, and in position to collect much more in both Blue and Red states. Behind there is a diminishing array of candidates with non-Trump delegates concentrating on only Cruz or Rubio. In the next few weeks, Carson and Kasich may fall. Eventually it is very likely that either Cruz or Rubio may give-up, concentrating the race in only Trump and an anti-Trump candidate.  The only difference in the 2016 election lies on the fact that none of the race leaders is really a favourite of the party machine.  So, my forecast is 90% yes.  Conditions to change my forecast: - unexpected resiliency on the part of one or more of the non-Trump candidates: if both Cruz,  Rubio or Kasich can get an impressive number of delegates it may put them in a position to bargain. This is especially true since Rubio, Cruz and Kasich are from big states (Florida, Texas and Ohio) where they are likely to win. Florida, Texas and Ohio are thus states to watch in order to tune this forecast."], [16775, "2016-02-22T13:23:34Z", [0.75], ""], [14277, "2016-02-22T07:55:06Z", [0.8], ""], [1293, "2016-02-22T07:09:00Z", [1.0], ""], [14253, "2016-02-22T03:32:26Z", [0.85], ""], [20116, "2016-02-22T02:07:08Z", [0.9], "Only two guys left.

That reason is that this has happened at every Republican convention in every election cycle for the last 68 years. The last brokered Republican convention was in 1948[1]. So the _outside view_ has to be that the probability that the Republican candidate for president will not get the party's nomination on the first ballot is close to zero.  Well, not so fast. Here's a point that was made by Nate Silver some time ago[4]. Sure, there hasn't been a brokered Republican convention in almost 7 decades, but conventions don't happen very often, so the sample size of data is pretty small. Furthermore, there have been a number of near misses. Republicans had a close call in 1976 when the then sitting president Gerald Ford lacked enough delegates to secure the nomination before the convention but somehow managed to gain enough support at the last moment to edge out challenger Ronald Reagan[2]. So if we start the clock at 1948, we'd have a 1/17 probability (round up to 6%) of a brokered convention as a baseline.  And there are some positive reasons for thinking it might happen this year. At the moment, there simply isn't a clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination. '\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see why a round of brokering in Cleveland isn\u2019t the most likely outcome,\u201d says Daniel Heninger, deputy editor of the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page. \u201cNone of these candidates looks likely to pull away and capture the majority of primary delegates before the party\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland next July.\u201d'[3] Fair enough, but there's this kind of talk during almost every election cycle on one side or the other[4]. A slightly more nuanced take is this: Trump appears to hover around 25%-35% in the primary polls. There's some evidence that his ceiling is 1/3 of the Republican primary voters[5]. If (and it's a big \"if\") that's true, and if (here's another big \"if\") candidates like Cruz, Rubio, Bush, and Kasich manage to split the anti-Trump vote[6], then there's a clear path to a failure to get a Republican nominee after a first round of voting at the convention.  All that said, media consumers like me need to be careful. Many journalists would love to be able to cover a brokered convention[7] (and I would too if I were a journalist), so they're likely to suffer from the positive valence effect[8]. I need to be careful so that I don't internalize this sort of bias. With all of this in mind I'd say that the current likelihood that the Republican candidate for president not win the party's nomination on the first ballot is about twice the baseline, rounding down 1 point in the hopes of avoiding the positive valence effect: 11%. Of course, this number will need to be updated often as the convention gets nearer.

Look at the vote split in Iowa.  Unless one of the three starts getting skunked in a big way, why would they drop out?  And when they go to the convention, they have all those votes they accumulated as currency to spend.  And virtually NO ONE in the republican establishment wants Trump, so unless he just kills it and gets a majority outright (subject to rules changes discussed below), the establishment will probably want a brokered convention.  They see themselves as the brokers after all.  Even if Trump just limps along and one of his major contenders move up, he will likely have enough votes to insist at a seat at the bargaining table.  And that is what Trump does for a living you know, cutting deals.  Love him or hate him, he literally wrote a book on the subject.   So for now, I am going with 35%.  If I see a clear winner I will cut my losses and increase probability.  But to the extent the field continues to be (or even becomes more) fragmented between more than two candidates, I reduce probability accordingly.     Something that is informing my thinking on this subject is that I am looking at the (albeit somewhat unreliable) polls for upcoming primaries.  Trump is strong, yes, but not dominant yet.  And I think the Florida polls are the most interesting, as they show Trump well in the lead, but not obtaining a majority.

Dr. Carson and Mrs. Fiorina will be allowed to fade on their own; further action need not be taken. Gov. Gilmore is already a non-entity, as is Sen. Santorum. The powers that be will pay lip service to the Tea Party, but they detest Sen. Cruz and will do just about anything to derail him, even to the point of risking lower Tea Party turnout in November (knowing that the prospect of a Clinton victory will turn them out in droves). Consistent whispers about Sen. Cruz's Constitutional status will be used to lure evangelicals to the almost as acceptable Sen. Rubio. But Mr. Trump's angry white men will be cut adrift... again. His is a constituency whose needs are antithetical to a winning general election campaign. These are not stupid people. They rallied to Mr. Trump because he actually was paying attention to them. But as it becomes clear that his candidacy is not supported by the structure that makes winning the White House possible, their interest will wane. So will his.

Right now, given how *insane* the GOP looks, of course, it's tempting to predict that there'll be a brokered convention, but I'm looking at this IFP in historical context and especially noticing its launch date (right before the primaries begin!) Meaning, right now, things look *extra* hairy because there haven't actually been any votes cast (saying yes in a poll for a person is much different than casting a ballot, not to mention that these polls aren't necessarily representative because most folks in these early states haven't made up their mind, yet, but there's no need to get too deep into that here). For right now, I see zero reason to back away from 100%. I'll watch the voting in the early states, of course, and of course, things will probably still look hairy.
