There are plenty of opinion pieces out there identifying which teams the writer's think should sign Kaepernick, but overall there's not much solid reporting of teams interested. It appears his best chance might be with Jacksonville, who's owner expressed interest in signing him. But beyond that, most teams are focusing on getting the team they have now ready for the regular season. Putting aside the politics, and looking at it from a straight cost-performance perspective, Kaepernick is not a great QB. He's good, and he's demonstrated he can be a threat through the air or on the ground, but he's not a one-man team. His record as starting QB in SF declined steadily during his tenure (5-2 in 2012, 12-4 in 2013, 8-8 in 2014, 2-6 in 2015, and 1-10 in 2016, or in win percentage terms, 71% in 2012, 75% in 2013, 50% in 2014, 25% in 2015, and 9% in 2016 of games started). As an owner, GM, or coach, I'm not enthralled with that trend, even with recognizing the myriad personnel challenges SF faced after the 2012 season. Kaepernick's politics definitely play a role to some degree in his inability to find a team who will sign him. However, the question is really a matter of the influence his politics have compared to his play, and that's a question each team is deciding behind closed doors, and to which I will not speculate. Instead, I'll simply point to the degradation of his play over the last 5 years as a strong indicator as to why teams are hesitant to sign him, as is likely the reason for other players such as RGIII who are no longer relevant."], [18846, "2017-08-28T12:24:53Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2017-08-28T11:06:48Z", [0.84], ""], [34725, "2017-08-28T10:15:33Z", [0.11], ""], [32258, "2017-08-28T03:01:10Z", [0.75], "Going with 75% with @SneakyPete531-- I commented at his post."], [23409, "2017-08-28T01:33:54Z", [0.04], ""], [83, "2017-08-28T00:03:48Z", [0.7], "Opportunity in Buffalo?\nhttps://www.buffalorumblings.com/2017/8/27/16211988/buffalo-bills-down-to-one-healthy-quarterback-following-baltimore-ravens-game-tyrod-taylor-tj-yates\nhttp://buffalonews.com/2017/08/27/bills-dilemma-head-injury-head-case/"], [8097, "2017-08-27T20:12:20Z", [0.25], ""], [16501, "2017-08-27T18:47:36Z", [0.15], ""], [1092, "2017-08-27T17:46:21Z", [0.05], "Teams will calculate that he is not worth the distraction."], [31201, "2017-08-27T16:48:16Z", [0.0], ""], [12879, "2017-08-27T15:56:26Z", [0.75], "After much consideration and seeing the increasing anti-American attitude of people trying to be \"Politically Correct\" plus I suspect, leftist leaning owners, he'll probably get a job offer soon. \ud83d\ude21"], [1019, "2017-08-27T15:54:02Z", [0.41], "Team owners have no spine."], [12573, "2017-08-27T14:23:04Z", [0.03], "I think too many teams are upset with his continual protestations, and don't want the extra drama his presence would create."], [33035, "2017-08-27T14:20:34Z", [0.1], ""], [28414, "2017-08-27T11:57:07Z", [0.9], ""], [691, "2017-08-27T11:35:41Z", [0.87], "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000834426/article/jaguars-owner-absolutely-open-to-signing-kaepernick\nSeveral stories yesterday, of which this is one, say the Jags might pick him up.
