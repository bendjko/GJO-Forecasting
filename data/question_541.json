Many US air strikes on al-Shabaab targets since Trump took office have succeeded in killing hundreds of militants. Additionally, African Union forces remain active in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab. Despite these facts, a chance of an attack on US diplomatic facilities does exist. Al-Shabaab is ideologically opposed to the West and thus may counter the increase in US involvement with a direct attack. Another possible path to attack on US diplomatic facilities could pan out as African Union troops continue to pull out of Somalia. With the Somalian government still weak and disorganized, al-Shabaab could regain former territories and increase its presence and power in the region, putting all targets, including US diplomatic facilities, at increased risk.

Attacks attributed to al-Shabaab by a nation's officials, where al-Shabaab declaims responsibility _might_ count. \"Attack\" = any attempted violence where the target is a US diplomatic facility.  The attempted violence must already have started, so the interception of a planned attack would not.  However, an attack that results in violence where the violence is halted short of the diplomatic facility itself _might_ count (eg. a raid that results in a firefight with roadblock forces a few hundred metres away from the facility). \"US diplomatic facility\" = \"Any Foreign Service establishment maintained by the US Department of State abroad\", as defined by the Department of Defense.  Generally only includes consulates and embassies, but more vaguely defined \"liaison offices\" may count too.  By a tight definition, the US has no \"diplomatic facility\" in Somalia, but but a broad definition, offices being used by the \"US Mission to Somalia\" _might_ count.  Technically, attacks on US diplomatic staff who are not in a \"US diplomatic facility\" should not count. THOUGHTS\nal-Shabaab is an organisation whose activities mostly take place in Somalia, Yemen, and the Somali-populated areas of Kenya: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Al-Shabaab_related_events.  That said, they have been able to strike at soft civilian targets in Kenya. There are many US diplomatic facilities in Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_the_United_States), but the only one anywhere near the al-Shabaad area of operations is the embassy in Nairobi.  IF al-Shabaab attacks a US diplomatic facility, it is most likely to be this one ... and that is a fairly hard target: it was rebuilt after a bombing in 1998 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Nairobi).  Indeed, US embassies in general have become much harder targets since 2001 (http://www.allgov.com/departments/department-of-state/bureau-of-overseas-buildings-operations?agencyid=7185). Given NO al-Shabaab attacks on ANY diplomatic facilities in the last 10 years, I find it difficult to see that al-Shabaab will start to target diplomatic facilities within the next 6 months and, if they do, why they would start with distant and highly defended US facilities? *********************************\nAfter roughly formulating the above, I have reviewed others' forecasts on this question.

(https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/07/30/world/africa/30reuters-somalia-attacks-offical.html)   If al-Shabaab targets a single country, rather than an intra-governmental agency, the historical trend shows Kenya being the main target, due to the Kenyan government sending troops to Somalia as part of the African Union. \n\u201cAl-Shabaab conducts regular attacks in Kenya, which they want to pressure into withdrawing its contingent from AMISOM.\u201d (https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/08/04/world/africa/04reuters-somalia-violence.html) \nPrevious attacks also suggest Kenya is a target due to its majority Christian population.  Given that the U.S. Mission to Somalia is operated out of the US Embassy in Nairobi, al-Shabaab fighters would have to travel to the city, it has been done before with the Westgate attack, but again there are softer targets along the Kenya/Somali border. \nThe upcoming Kenyan Presidential elections and increase in al-Shabaab-claimed attacks \u201cpresents a huge problem for Kenya\u2019s security agencies\u2026On election day security agencies will be strained while attempting to stop any possible violence and al-Shabaab could take advantage\u201d (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/08/nine-kenyans-beheaded-by-somali-al-shabaab-terrorists). This, along with the recent U.S. conducted operation that targeted Ali Mohamed Hussein or Ali Jabal, could give al-Shabaab a reason to target the embassy. (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-security-idUSKBN1AK19F?il=0) \nHowever, the U.S. embassy is also situated on the same road as the United Nations so if there are adequate security measures in place, I would expect there to be a checkpoint for vehicles before you can get to the buildings, which would limit the opportunity for an attack.

March 2007:    Adam Salaam Adam engages in an attack with a car bomb in a suicide attack against government soldiers;  73 killed, unknown wounded. October 2008:    Al Shabaab conducts five simultaneous suicide car bombs i n the cities of Haragisha and Bosasso targeting UNDP offices and government buildings.

June 2013:    Suicide bomber detonates a  car bomb at UNDP in Mogadishu.  Al Shabaab fighters enter the compound and engage security force;  22 killed, 20 wounded.

However this set of activity should only be considered periodic, as needed, and not permanent.  The relationship between Al Qaddafi and Al Shabaab are more complex and ongoing.
