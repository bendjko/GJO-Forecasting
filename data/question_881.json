Kennedy was considered by many to be the court's swing vote, often casting the deciding vote between the court's more conservative and liberal members. His retirement will allow President Donald Trump (R) an opportunity to make his second appointment to the nation's highest court. In his 30-year career on the bench, Kennedy authored a number of noteworthy opinions: Obergefell v. Hodges, Citizens United v. FEC, and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey. The two supreme court confirmations that happened under Barack Obama made took an average of 109 days from retirement announcement to confirmation of the successor. Appointment of Elena Kagan\nRetirement announcement of predecessor: 4/9/2010\nConfirmation: 8/5/2010\nNumber of days: 119\n\nAppointment of Sonia Sotomayor\nRetirement announcement of predecessor: 4/30/2009\nConfirmation: 8/6/2009\nNumber of days: 99\nTrump\u2019s first confirmation was Neil Gorsuch, who was filling the seat of Antonin Scalia. Obama had previously nominated Merrick Garland, but the Senate declined to confirm him. The time between Scalia\u2019s death and Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation was 419 days. Appointment of Neil Gorsuch\nDeath of predecessor: 2/13/2016\nConfirmation: 4/7/2017\nNumber of days: 419\nThree more facts to know\nThe last vacancy to occur on the Supreme Court during a midterm election year was in 1994 when Harry Blackmun retired. Then-President Bill Clinton replaced him with Stephen Breyer.\n\nThe average number of Supreme Court nominations made by presidents is 2.5, not including George Washington or Trump. Franklin D. Roosevelt made eight nominations, the most of any president. The second-highest number was five, which were made by four presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, William Howard Taft, Abraham Lincoln, and Andrew Jackson. \n\nThe next justice appointed will be the 114th United States Supreme Court Justice.\nNext in the process\nIt usually starts with the president choosing a nominee. It is not uncommon for the president to consult Senate leadership and the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee before deciding on a nominee. President Trump said on Tuesday that his nominee will come from a list of 25 possible nominees that the White House released in November."], [59499, "2018-06-28T00:08:12Z", [1.0], ""], [24162, "2018-06-27T20:14:00Z", [1.0], ""], [59405, "2018-06-27T18:53:53Z", [0.66], ""], [59405, "2018-06-27T18:53:29Z", [0.15], ""], [691, "2018-06-27T18:44:56Z", [1.0], ""], [43311, "2018-06-27T18:06:31Z", [1.0], "Yay!

If the SCOTUS restricts agency fees but still allows some, it will fail to meet the requirement that \"mandatory payment of ANY agency fees...is unconstitutional.\" Gorsuch remained silent throughout the arguments. However, Amy Howe's summary suggests that Fredericks, the State of Illinois attorney, laid out the following arguments:\n1) In the 40+ years since Abood, 23 states plus P.R. and D.C. have established rules concerning public employees & agency fees. If Janus wins, it would amount to applying a new rule for old cases, raising the question of how far back to draw the line (the slippery slope problem). \n2) Overturning Abood may be potentially very disruptive (which the Conservative justices seem to dismiss)\n3) There may still be room for compromise. Justice Breyer mentioned the amicus brief filed by Charles Fried, suggesting that certain fees should be easy to separate out and maintain, such as costs incurred during ensuring appropriate wages, hours, and working conditions. The fact that Gorsuch remained silent during the hearing does not help. However, based on these arguments, I believe the Gorsuch will allow agency fees for public non-union employees to continue but with additional restrictions. http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/02/argument-analysis-gorsuch-stays-mum-union-fees/"], [178, "2018-02-27T17:05:22Z", [0.79], ""], [55042, "2018-02-27T16:59:01Z", [0.75], ""], [43311, "2018-02-27T14:35:34Z", [1.0], ""], [44851, "2018-02-27T12:36:20Z", [0.1], "The overturning of mandatory union fees would change a powerful counterweight to the power held by employers, and a powerful Democratic lobby.

AFSCME, a public unions case that could finally resolve a union fees issue that the court has struggled to address several times in the last few years. The issue in Janus is whether the Supreme Court should overrule its 1977 decision in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that public sector employees can be required to pay agency fees. The plaintiff in this case is Mark Janus, a public sector employee in Illinois. Janus challenged an Illinois statute requiring public sector employees to pay agency fees. Generally, members of a labor union pay fees to the union. Those fees support the union's activities. Unions' activities can include collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment, as well as political activities like lobbying. Some public sector employees do not want to join a union, and some are opposed to unions' political activities. In recognition of those employees' First Amendment rights, they cannot be required to financially support a union's political activities. However, in the 1977 case Abood v. Detroit Education Association, the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was not a violation of employees' First Amendment rights to require them to pay fees to support the union activities from which they benefited, like collective bargaining. Fees from non-member employees who do not want to support a union's political activities are called agency fees or fair share fees. Agency fees are a proportionate share of the costs of collective bargaining and contract administration. The rule in Abood has been challenged several times in the past few years. Most recently, public school teachers in California challenged agency fees in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. That 2016 case involved a California statute similar to the Illinois statute Janus challenged. However, the Supreme Court was not able to issue a determinative ruling in Friedrichs. Friedrichs was decided by the court after the death of former Justice Antonin Scalia but before the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch. With only eight justices, the court split four-four in Friedrichs. A four-four split in the U.S. Supreme Court leaves in place the lower court's ruling but does not create any binding precedent. With a full roster of nine justices, this case offers the Supreme Court the opportunity to expressly uphold or overrule Abood.\nOn Monday, the court will also hear arguments in Ohio v. American Express., a case about antitrust suits under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. In order to determine whether a defendant has violated \u00a7 1 in cases like this one, courts use a test called the rule of reason. Under the first step of the test, \u201ca plaintiff bears the initial burden of demonstrating that a defendant\u2019s challenged behavior had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market.\u201d American Express (Amex) has historically included nondiscriminatory provisions (NDPs) in its agreements with merchants who accept Amex from their customers. Amex's NDPs require, among other things, that merchants cannot state a preference for any card over an Amex card. The United States and a number of U.S. states filed suit against Amex, Visa, and Mastercard, alleging violations of the Sherman Act. The other defendants resolved their cases separately, and Amex proceeded to trial. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the U.S. and the states had failed to carry their burden under the first step of the test, meaning that they could not hold Amex liable. It ruled, \u201cTo prove that the anti-steering provisions were anticompetitive...the Government bore the burden to show not just that the provisions had anticompetitive pricing effects on the merchant side, but also that those anticompetitive effects outweighed any benefits on the cardholder side.\" The court concluded, \"We find that without evidence of the NDPs\u2019 net effect on both merchants and cardholders, the District Court could not have properly concluded that the NDPs unreasonably restrain trade in violation of \u00a7 1 [of the Sherman Act].\" The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.\nOn Tuesday, the court will hear United States v. Microsoft, a highly anticipated case about law enforcement\u2019s access to data held by email providers outside the U.S.The United States obtained a warrant for the email contents of one of Microsoft\u2019s email customers. When served with the warrant, Microsoft sought to quash or void the warrant on the grounds that the content the warrant sought was stored overseas. Microsoft argued that the warrant could not apply to reach data outside U.S. borders. A federal district court disagreed, ordering Microsoft to comply with the warrant and sanctioning Microsoft for its initial refusal to comply. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, ruling that the statute under which the warrant was authorized was not designed to be extraterritorial and therefore did not apply outside of the United States. The court will also hear arguments on Tuesday in Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, a First Amendment case about the scope of claims for retaliatory arrest. Fane Lozman was arrested at a Riviera Beach City Council meeting after refusing to stop speaking when a councilperson instructed him to stop. The charges against him were dismissed. Lozman filed suit against the city, claiming that the arrest was made not because he was suspected of engaging in unlawful conduct but in retaliation for Lozman's criticisms of the city's plan to use eminent domain to revitalize a portion of the city's waterfront. At trial in Lozman\u2019s suit, the district court judge instructed the jury that they could only find in Lozman's favor if they concluded that there was no probable cause in support of Lozman's arrest. The jury found for the city. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled, \"The jury\u2019s determination that the arrest was supported by probable cause defeats Lozman\u2019s First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim as a matter of law.\" A retaliatory arrest claim is one where a plaintiff alleges that they were arrested not because they committed a crime but in retaliation for exercising their free speech rights--most often, allegedly in retaliation for the plaintiff publicly criticizing a government official or governmental decision. In this case, the stated reason for Lozman's arrest was the suspicion that he was disturbing the peace. Lozman's claim is that his arrest was retaliation for his criticisms of the council's plans. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether the fact that there was probable cause for an arrest bars Lozman's claim for retaliatory arrest.\nFinally, on Wednesday, the court will hear arguments in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky. The Minnesota Voters Alliance and several other groups and individuals, including the Minnesota Northstar Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Watch, filed suit against the Minnesota Secretary of State and other elections officials in Minnesota. The plaintiffs challenged Minnesota Statute \u00a7 211B.11, which \"prohibits wearing a 'political badge, political button, or other political insignia . . . at or about the polling place on primary or election day.\u201d Under the statute, a person who wore political apparel to a polling place was still allowed to vote. However, if the person refused to cover or remove the item, they could face a misdemeanor charge for violating the statute. The plaintiffs argued that the statute violated their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because it prohibited them from wearing apparel with Tea Party logos to their polling places. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled against the plaintiffs. Citing earlier Supreme Court cases, the court ruled, \u201cRestrictions on speech in a nonpublic forum are constitutionally valid if viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose which the forum at issue serves.\u201d\nAs of publication today, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in 71 cases so far this term; of those 71, the court has heard arguments in 43 cases. The court will continue to hear arguments in cases this term through April 2018. Although it may continue to consider new appeals, its current number of accepted cases--71--is the same as the total number of cases it agreed to hear last term. With arguments scheduled through March, the court has limited number of argument days left to fill. Wondering where the cases are coming from this term?

In Riddle v. Hickenlooper, he opined that campaign finance was a basic constitution freedom, similar to free speech. The key question, then, is how will Gorsuch treat agency fees? The 1977 SCOTUS ruled in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that labor unions can compel non-union members to pay fees that cover the cost of negotiating contracts that apply to all public employees, aka \"fair share\" or \"agency fees.\" Non-union members cannot be compelled to pay for political activities. The matter at hand is if \"agency fees\" violate free speech. No public employee would ever ask for less income or benefits, thus the plaintiff's assertion to violation of free speech is contradictory by its very nature.
