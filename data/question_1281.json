For example, Solo had a first weekend of $85mm whereas the Last Jedi had $220mm (less than 0.5 multiplier). Puss in Boots had a first weekend of $35mm whereas Shrek Forever After had $70mm (about 0.5 multiplier). Spider-Man Homecoming had first weekend of $117 whereas Venom had $80mm (somewhat more than 0.5 multiplier). So, roughly we can say that spin-offs of minor characters are roughly a 0.5 multiplier. Applying this rule, we get to 0.5 * 210 = $105mm first week.  Dark Knight had a production budget of $185mm, much of which will be put towards marketing. Joker, on the other hand, has a fraction of the budget (only $55mm per Wikipedia). If you assume a constant first-week return on production spend, you would then assume about ~$60mm for first week (55/185*210). That said, you cannot assume a constant return on production spend. Joker is clearly leveraging past marketing spend on Batman (as well as the memory of Heath Ledger). I would add that if you compare production spend on this film on a relative basis to the other spin-off films mentioned you will notice that it is unusually low (Venom / Puss in Boots and Solo had massive budgets). I tend to think the $60mm is too low, but the low-budget nature of this film is concerning.  Deadpool made 130mm in opening weekend (so likely ~175mm opening week) for R-rated superhero movie while spending approximately the same amount as Joker. Moreover, Deadpool is a fairly unknown character that nobody cares about, much like Joker. That said, Deadpool was a clever movie that was lighthearted and it was an original film, not a spin off (note that Deadpool 2 required a far higher marketing spend). On the other hand, Joker has better actors. Joaquin Phoenix gets about $25mm opening week if he is the lead actor, whereas Ryan Reynolds gets more like $40mm (about 60% higher). Morena gets about $100mm in an opening week on average, whereas Zazie Beets does not even show up on BO Mojo. Normalizing for actors, then the Deadpool prior would imply $110mm. Someone mentioned that Joker had similar YouTube trailer views as Toy Story 4, which had opening week of something like $160mm (120/0.75). That said, the key distinction here is that Toy Story is a normal sequel, not a prequel spin-out of a minor character, so these are not comparable. Simple sequels are far more likely to maintain similar sales as the original. Consider for example that Star Wars I vs. II had no drop-off in initial sales (it actually increased). Moreover, I would note that the R-square here is fairly low. One of the users provided XLS data on the correlation and it looks very low.  Based on the analysis above, my midpoint estimate is something like $100mm, so I attach the highest probability to the middle answer choice ($90-110mm). Note also that this is right on top of the official BO Mojo estimate of $75mm opening weekend (75/0.75 = ~$100mm).  The question now is: what is the shape of the outcome distribution? I actually believe it is skewed heavily toward zero. A big problem is availability bias - we are more likely to remember successful films on the right tail of the distribution, so we are biased to pick examples that are successful. The actual distribution of film sales is log normal (with a lot of forgettable films on the left tail of the outcome distribution and a few outstanding successes we remember and choose as examples). For this reason, I skewed my outcome distribution towards lower values. That said, I increased the weight of $130mm+ since it is an unbounded value (e.g., goes from $130mm to infinity)."], [15358, "2019-09-22T16:58:52Z", [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.35, 0.05], ""], [39381, "2019-09-22T16:29:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.73, 0.17], ""], [14107, "2019-09-21T12:53:28Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.31, 0.51, 0.12], ""], [79600, "2019-09-21T10:28:41Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.4, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [78328, "2019-09-21T08:29:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8, 0.0], ""], [78328, "2019-09-21T08:14:03Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.2], ""], [50981, "2019-09-20T15:05:52Z", [0.1, 0.35, 0.55, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79578, "2019-09-20T00:24:30Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.75, 0.05], ""], [691, "2019-09-19T13:36:44Z", [0.04, 0.22, 0.42, 0.23, 0.09], ""], [1333, "2019-09-18T20:16:56Z", [0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [4492, "2019-09-18T14:44:50Z", [0.1, 0.28, 0.33, 0.24, 0.05], ""], [79079, "2019-09-18T12:52:07Z", [0.0, 0.13, 0.75, 0.12, 0.0], ""], [79069, "2019-09-18T09:57:14Z", [0.05, 0.5, 0.4, 0.05, 0.0], "Unconventional anti-hero back story makes it harder to predict, but the darker plot line seems to be getting lots of publicity and is perhaps appropriate for the times.

Based on what I've looked up, the economy has very little impact on cinema/theatre attendance. Peoples opinions and political views don't stop them from going to watch a movie and spin off prequel stories such as Rogue one (which I would tentatively compare the joker to) capture peoples attention and interest. What impacts box office takings though are BFFC ratings (or whatever the equivalent is in the US) with a 15 in the UK (and equivalent elsewhere) I'd expect the joker to take a 25-30% hit in comparison to such movies. The number of explosions in the trailers are lacking which means your typical \"End game\" fans will show less interest. But I still expect this to take over 130 mil. I'm not going to hazard at exactly how much and I might revise my prediction after some more analysis, but right now I find it hard to see this movie taking less than 145 mil. I also don't fully understand what some people are talking about when comparing trailer view stats, the main joker trailer has the same number of views as toy story 4 (admittedly not directly comparable but what other movie is? Hobbs and Shaw? Come on now...) anyway: toy story 4 is out and has its first week takings recorded at 178 mil... the joker still has over a month to gain traction with its audience and is currently over 56 million views. The best movie to compare this to would be venom... released last year, took 107 mil, Based on an anti hero found in a less popular franchise with the same viewer rating of 15 with well recognised lead actors. Admittedly more action shown in the trailer, but based on viewer ratings, the venom trailer currently has 79 million views, so I'd assume it had around 60 million on release. Using that as a bench mark I'm going with 145 for now... Edit: You might also consider comparing this to \"it\", \"logan\", \"maleficent\" and perhaps \"Spectre\"  -- thats definitely a tired franchise and people still watch them.\nEdit: also don't just go by views, check out the number of likes these movie trailers have. Joker is at 1.2 mil, hobbs and shaw, (approx same views on main trailer) has 1/4 of that and venom has 800k\nEdit: as of 27th, marketing campaign is ramping up with several teaser clips released on social media, worth analysing these, but also the 2nd trailer comes out today (28th) and theres a showing at some art festival on the 31st (venice beach!? idk) the response to all of these will be incredibly insightful, I'm already confident the response will be positive but how loud that response is will be an indicator of revenues.

A couple of well written quips, Joaquin's awesome mojo and an unlikely cultish anti-hero plot-line might save the day for evil, er for therapy against evil, er well.. whatever.

Most weeks, the top grossing movie is somewhere in the $30-50M range. Let's look at the first week returns for a few top movies for this year[1]: $41M - Lego sequel\n$39M - Alita Battle Angel\n$67M - How to Train Your Dragon Franchise\n$196M - Captain Marvel\n$94M - Us\n$58M - Dumbo\n$69M - Shazam\n$473M - Avengers: Endgame\n$70M - Pokemon Franchise\n$76M - John Wick Franchise\n$83M - Hobbes & Shaw Another issue? Joker is the first film in the Batman live-action franchise to receive an R-rating.[2] This is relevant because \"a movie rated PG-13 will earn between $15M \u2013 $34M more than an R-rated movie, all else equal.\"[3] So, as a comparison, the first and second John Wick movies made $14M and $30M their first weeks.[4] Or, we could take the original Batman Begins, it made $48 million ($48M * 1.31 = $62M adjusting 2005 to 2019 dollars) as a PG-13 movie.[5] Hobbes & Shaw, still PG-13, got $83M with Dwayne Johnson, the most bankable film star in the modern era, in an action movie. Joaquin Phoenix is no Dwayne Johnson, and the Joker ain't an action movie. If you want to talk about Us, Todd Phillips isn't Jordan Peele. Last movie by Phillips, War Dogs earned ~$15M its opening week.  I'm going to guess this is going to be in the $40-50M range, which will be great for the studio since it will earn back the production money in the first week and everything else will be gravy.
