Instead of only looking at the inside view \u2014 qualities of the candidates and case at hand \u2014 I am also going to look at forecasters who have a successful track record of predicting Super Tuesday outcomes in the past, with different candidates.  I identified one such candidate as David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research, who leads a research project called PredictWise which aggregates data from various betting and forecasting sources.  He estimates that in 10 of the 11 states, Trump is up \u2014 ranging from 67% to 96%.  This leads me to a 75% estimate in favor of Trump having the most pledged delegates.

Projected delegate totals at the end of Super Tuesday based on recent polls & intuition:\nTrump: 347  (gain of 265)\nCruz: 188  (gain of 171)\nRubio: 153  (gain of 137)\nKasich: 16 (gain of 10)\nCarson: 13 (gain of 8) Some different scenarios might be: Cruz sweeps Texas by beating 50% threshold; Kasich sweeps Vermont & beats 50% threshold; Kasich & Rubio both overperform significantly in Massachusetts;\nTrump: 273\nCruz: 271\nRubio: 122\nKasich: 39\nCarson: 13\nIn this (pretty unlikely) scenario, Cruz has essentially tied or overtaken Trump in delegates. If we jiggle the numbers a little, it would be easy to come up with numbers that favor Cruz over Trump. But this would require a stunning margin of victory by Cruz in Texas as well as holding the front in all other states. This would also entail a complete upset in Vermont and a near-complete upset in Massachusetts.  In another possible scenario, Trump overperforms in a couple southern states and breaks the 50% threshold required to take all delegates. In this case, the vote turns out looking something like:\nTrump: 400\nCruz: 172\nRubio: 117\nKasich: 16\nCarson: 13\nIn this case, Cruz and Rubio would lose the most with Rubio possibly losing an even greater proportional share than Cruz. In this case, Trump is an almost prohibitive favorite.  It seems that among the candidates, Cruz and Trump are the most likely to hit the 50% threshold necessary in the \"winner-take-most\" states. Rubio & Kasich are almost always most competitive in states where delegates are proportionally allocated - an advantage for underdog candidates but certainly not an advantage for anyone posturing as a front-runner.  It is quite possible that Carson may finally leave the race after Super Tuesday. Kasich will be done if he under-performs on Super Tuesday (doesn't win any states, doesn't gain more than 15 delegates). \nAt this point before Super Tuesday, Rubio continues to be the weakest link despite the exit of Bush & many other so-called \"establishment\" candidates. Cruz continues to be a both a major spoiler and foil to Trump's campaign - Trump is essentially a slicker, more intoxicating version of what Cruz is peddling.  Tl;dr:\nTrump will be the big winner - Rubio will probably be the big loser unless one or two states see a candidate break 50%. In that case, Trump will be an even BIGGER winner or we may see a situation where Trump, Cruz and Rubio all walk out of Super Tuesday claiming victory & the race continues as it has, though I predict this to be unlikely.

Unfortunately, it's not. Trump is running away with the nomination, and though Cruz and Rubio have made attempts to dent his momentum, the window for that has been pretty much closed for Super Tuesday. Here's my thoughts on the race followed by state by state analysis: - The Current Delegate Count: Trump - 82, Cruz - 17, Rubio - 16.\n- Trump's Coalition: Unlike Clinton on the Democratic side, Trump's coalition is really hazy. He did well with almost everyone except very conservative voters in South Carolina (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/20/us/south-carolina-primary-exit-poll.html). Additionally, He won almost all ideologies in New Hampshire but came in very close to Kasich with moderates (http://www.cnn.com/election/primaries/polls/nh/Rep). In one sense, he has broad appeal, and this may propel him to victory as long as the field is crowded.\n- The Futility of the Cruz, Kasich and Carson Campaigns: Each of these is pretty much doomed. I'll discuss Cruz simply because of his current delegate counts, but realistically, if he can't lock any southern state except Texas, he's doomed.\n- State by State analysis: Alabama (50 delegates): Insiders say to expect that Alabama will mirror South Carolina. Sen. Jeff Sessions endorsed Trump today, which will only increase his share of the vote. I'd put Trump at 40% with Rubio at 25% and Cruz slightly behind. Alabama's rules require at least 20% of the vote to earn a share of delegates, and that's dangerous territory for Rubio and Cruz. Since I estimate both above 20%, I'll leave them in.\nAlaska (28 delegates): With Palin's endorsement, Trump is likely to carry 40% of the vote. Cruz will likely come in second with Rubio in third.\nArkansas (40 delegates): Your guess is as good as mine. Not much polling has occurred here. Hutchinson endorsed Rubio, but Trump has spent time here and the demos better fit him than Rubio. Trump may hit 40% with Cruz a close second.\nGeorgia (76 delegates): Trump locked this when he locked South Carolina. Like Alabama, it requires 20% of the vote for delegates and that doesn't bode well for Cruz or Rubio.\nMassachusetts (42 delegates): Based on how well he did in New Hampshire, Trump should easily pick up Massachusetts. \nMinnesota (38 delegates): Limited polling data suggests this is anyone's state.\nOklahoma (43 delegates): Another \"anyone's state,\" Trump is currently leading.\nTennessee (58 delegates): Another murky state, Trump should theoretically do well given the demos.\nTexas (155 delegates): You'd think Cruz should win this one, which I think he will. However,the question is the margin. A close call with Trump likely spells disaster for him.\nVermont (16 delegates): Trump lock based on similar reasoning to New Hampshire.\nVirginia (49 delegates): A more moderate State, I still believe this will go for Trump by a high margin.\nWyoming (29 delegates): Since these delegates are unbound, there is no prediction to be made here.

I am updating my prior 90% estimate in favor of trump to as high as I can go.  Post SC & Nevada, it's hard to see mathematically how he does not come out of super tuesday ahead in delegates (note: I would LOVE to be proved wrong - and acknowledge this stuff is unpredictable and I am in no way an expert.  I do think we have a preponderance of evidence supporting Trump though - my logic and thought process is below). Currently, Trump has 82 delegates (vs. Cruz = 17, Rubio = 16). 624 delegates will be awarded on Super Tuesday.  On face of it, either C or R only need a to best Trump by a little over 10% of gross delegate count that day to \"win\" this qn, which should be encouraging.  Cruz is also ahead in the polls in the largest state (TX).  That is the end of the encouraging data points I can see.  (sidenote: actually, I think 94 of the ST delegates are in 'no allocation' states, so for purposes of this qn, I believe only 530 \"pledged\" delegates will be added that day... would love to hear if that's wrong, I wasn't 100% sure) Nearly all these states are proportional allocators (or winner-take-most, with fairly high \"winner\" thresholds), which means they are less likely to cause huge/jerky swings in delegate count.  Even if Trump is beaten in some states, if he remains in 2nd, he will still pick up delegates.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016#March_1.2C_2016:_Super_Tuesday He is also ahead in the polls of every state other than TX that has recent polling, and I'd note the polling so far has been pretty decent:  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/march1GOP.html   (many states don't have recent polls, so idk, if you really think Carson's still ahead in Colorado then I have a bridge to sell you.  Let's be honest with ourselves - Trump is most likely ahead in CO...) What's almost worse for purposes of this qn, because Cruz and Rubio each have weaknesses in some states they will be splitting delegates (obviously making accumulating vs. Trump more difficult since he is the key competitor everywhere).  For Trump to be behind in delegates after Mar 1st, you'd have to believe they both surge in a large anti-trump movement and deny him delegates across the board.  The math / polling summary is below by state. Format: \nState - Delegates - Winner and % ahead - 2nd/3rd and %'s - Last Poll Date TX - 155 - Cruz +7% w/ 34% - Trump at 27% (Rubio 18%) - 2/24/16\nGA - 76 - Trump +16% at 37% (Rubio 21%, Cruz 18%) - 2/23/16\nTN - 58 - No current polling, but Trump has been ahead in every poll since August\nAL - 50 - No current polling, but Trump has been ahead in every poll since August\nVA - 49 - Trump +15% at 36% (Rubio 21%, Cruz 16%) - 2/24/16\nOK - 43 - Trump +7% at 30% (Cruz 23%, Rubio 21%) - 2/23/16\nMA - 42 - Trump +28% at 45% (Rubio 18%, Cruz 10%) - 2/23/16\nAR - 40 - No current polling, but Cruz was +4% in early Feb - might be similar to TX numbers\nMN - 38 - No current polling, but Rubio had a v slight (2%) lead in mid-January \nCO - 37 (no allocation, so my understanding is that although delegates in state will be elected, we may not firmly know who they are for until their state convention in april, as they are not holding a vote on president to actually bind those delegates to a candidate)\nWY - 29 (no allocation)\nND - 28 (no allocation)\nAK - 28 - no current polling, but Trump was +4% in January at 28 (Cruz was strong 2nd at 24, Rubio was only 7)\nVT - 16 -  Trump +15% at 32  (Rubio 17, Cruz 11) - 2/17/16 So Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahama are Cruz Territory (+ Alaska maybe - for 266 delegates total), whereas Rubio is the #2 pick everywhere else (264 delegates, since again 94 delegates belong to states that will not have to officially pledge based on popular vote on the 1st).   What would very negative outcome for Trump look like? First, let's say Cruz surges big time in his region.  TX (his home state) is a winner-take-most state.  Although he needs a ~+15% outperformance vs. polls to achieve the majority he would need to deny Trump any delegates, let's say he gets it  (+155).  Trump is ahead in OK and AK (and behind slightly in AR), but let's say the Cruz surge blunts him, and they split those states 40-40-20 with Rubio (111 delegates, so ~ 44-44-22). Now on to Rubio territories.  Most of these states will be proportional if Rubio does well (winner-take-most, but Trump is way ahead in all of them, it would take a ~30 pt Rubio surge to get to a majority which just isn't realistic...).  I'm not going to make a state-by-state forecast, but Trump is ahead in every single one with current numbers, mostly with double-digit leads.  264 delegates are up for grabs in the states, let's say there is a massive Rubio surge post-2/25 debate, he wins the close states and they wind up splitting broadly across group 45-45-10 with Cruz (119-119-26) In this scenario, with both Rubio and Cruz outperforming polls by 15%+, the pledged delegate count would be: Trump: 82 (current) + 44 (Cruz States) + 119 (Rubio States) = 245\nCruz: 17 (current) + 155 (TX) +44 (Cruz States) + 26 (Rubio States) = 242\nRubio: 16 (Current) + 22 (Cruz States) + 119 (Rubio States) = 157 You can disagree with every assumption here, I certainly do not think it is a plausible scenario.  It's only purpose is to demonstrate that mathematically it is VERY difficult to see Trump not ahead in delegates after Tuesday, even if his rivals wildly outperform their recent poll numbers.  I believe that if Trump IS behind in delegates, it is because something big enough happens to make the polling we have meaningless.  I don't know what that would look like (I don't think the debate was even close to enough), but with only a few days left I think putting it at ~2% chance is probably plenty generous..."], [16940, "2016-02-26T23:50:55Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0, 0.18, 0.7], ""], [101, "2016-02-26T23:47:41Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [17347, "2016-02-26T23:42:56Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.8], ""], [15997, "2016-02-26T23:23:34Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.01, 0.11, 0.83], ""], [20665, "2016-02-26T23:11:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.85], ""], [15621, "2016-02-26T23:09:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0, 0.11, 0.87], "Christie and momentum and a lead in polls and starting with a good lead"], [20521, "2016-02-26T23:04:18Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.32, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.58], ""], [18214, "2016-02-26T23:01:42Z", [0.25, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.45], ""], [17233, "2016-02-26T22:59:22Z", [0.1, 0.05, 0.45, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.15], ""], [19229, "2016-02-26T22:59:09Z", [0.05, 0.03, 0.25, 0.0, 0.01, 0.2, 0.46], ""], [17453, "2016-02-26T22:38:00Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.55], ""], [18475, "2016-02-26T22:37:16Z", [0.09, 0.09, 0.09, 0.05, 0.09, 0.29, 0.3], ""], [17346, "2016-02-26T22:25:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9], ""], [20608, "2016-02-26T22:24:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.85], "Chris Christie's endorsement of Trump is a strong indicator that the Republican establishment sees his popular momentum as unstoppable and that they will hold their noses to support him on the off-chance that they are currying favour with a potential future President.

In order to make sure that he remains ahead after Super Tuesday, he only needs to maintain this head start by 1 delegate. Suppose Trump wins 280 delegates on Super Tuesday. Then Trump ends the day with 362 (82+280) delegates. And suppose that - per impossible - Cruz wins all of the remaining 344 (624-280) delegates. That gives Cruz 361 delegates. In short, Trump needs only get 44.8% of the delegates available on Super Tuesday to _guarantee_ he'll have the most delegates after Super Tuesday. How hard will it for be for Trump to win 44.8% of the delegates available on Super Tuesday? Up to this point he's been winning 61.6% of the delegates in play, and there are now fewer candidates with which to compete, so my initial thought is: Not that hard. As long as Trump performs 73% (44.8%/61.6%) as well as he has in the first 4 primary states, then he is guaranteed to come out ahead on delegates.  And is there any reason to think that Trump will underperform by such a large margin? Not much, as far as I can see. Trump has a 77% chance of winning Alabama[3], a 79% chance of winning Georgia[4], a 43% chance of winning Massachusetts (ahead of Rubio at 18%)[5], a 43% chance of winning Oklahoma (ahead of Rubio at 41% - really too close to call)[6] - despite being unable to spell the name of the state correctly[7] - and a 66% chance of winning Virginia[8]. Only in Texas is Trump an underdog. Here Cruz has an 83% of winning with Trump and Rubio each getting about 9%[9]. This last fact is not trivial since Texas has 155 total delegates to pledge.  Suppose that we give Cruz 35% and Rubio 30% of the delegates (giving the larger number to Cruz because of his advantage in Texas) and throw another 5% at Carson and Kasich. The outcome would look like this: Cruz: 17 + 219 (=0.35*624) = 236 delegates\nRubio: 16 + 188 (=0.30*624) = 204 delegates\nKasich and Carson eat up 32 delegates, but who cares? That leaves 185 (=624-439) delegates for Trump, and combined with his 82 delegate total coming in, he easily retains his lead with 267 (=185+82) delegates. So Trump could come out ahead on Super Tuesday in this (not unrealistic) scenario by winning just less than 30% of the delegates and coming in behind both Cruz and Rubio in the total number of delegates won. So I think that the probability that Trump will lead in delegates after Super Tuesday is very high indeed.  I admit that the delegate math is a nightmare[10], but I'm not even going to try to make sense of it because life is just too damn short. If it makes a big difference to my forecast, then I wouldn't be surprised if someone points it out. Hope I managed to get the math right.... -- [1] http://frontloading.blogspot.com/p/2016-republican.html [2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/25/donald-trump-needs-to-win-only-39-percent-of-super-tuesday-delegates-to-stay-on-pace-to-be-the-gop-nominee/ [3] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/alabama-republican/ [4] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/georgia-republican/ [5] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/massachusetts-republican/ [6] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/oklahoma-republican/ [7] http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/trump-oklahoma-spelling-219775 [8] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/virginia-republican/ [9] http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/texas-republican/ [10] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016"], [17440, "2016-02-26T04:40:23Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5], ""], [17401, "2016-02-26T04:30:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.37, 0.0, 0.0, 0.21, 0.42], ""], [17799, "2016-02-26T04:19:22Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.3], ""], [17134, "2016-02-26T04:17:59Z", [0.0, 0.02, 0.25, 0.0, 0.03, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [4729, "2016-02-26T04:15:58Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.65], ""], [20623, "2016-02-26T04:14:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.4], ""], [17746, "2016-02-26T04:13:46Z", [0.05, 0.0, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.45], ""], [17997, "2016-02-26T04:11:43Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.6], ""], [6303, "2016-02-26T04:11:33Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.5], "Trump has the momentum and is ahead of Rubio in Florida.\nCruz is ahead of Trump in Texas."], [17495, "2016-02-26T03:51:06Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.25], ""], [18181, "2016-02-26T03:35:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.3], ""], [17397, "2016-02-26T03:32:32Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.24, 0.0, 0.0, 0.23, 0.53], ""], [18307, "2016-02-26T03:28:39Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.75], ""], [17787, "2016-02-26T02:55:20Z", [0.15, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.25, 0.56], ""], [18644, "2016-02-26T02:50:27Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.84], ""], [18644, "2016-02-26T02:45:15Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5], ""], [17076, "2016-02-26T02:23:38Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.65], ""], [18269, "2016-02-26T02:23:21Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.35], ""], [10898, "2016-02-26T02:11:44Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.9], "Current count: Trump/Cruz/Rubio (T/C/R from now on)=82/17/16 The Super Tuesday Primary States all divvy up delegates proportionally.

If candidates don\u2019t get 20 percent of the vote, they get no delegates (unless they finish in the top two of a congressional district, in which case they get a delegate). Oklahoma and Arkansas, worth an additional 13 percent of Super Tuesday delegates, have a 15 percent threshold. \"It is easy to imagine how none of the mainstream candidates pass this threshold. None reached 20 percent of the vote in New Hampshire; they\u2019re failing to reach 20 percent in South Carolina polls; and they might fall short again on Super Tuesday if the field doesn\u2019t narrow further. \"Worse still for them, a quirk in the rules would send the delegates forfeited by the mainstream candidates straight to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

The three most likely candidates to come out of super tuesday with the most delegates are: Trump, Rubio, and Cruz.  Trump has a  95 percent chance of having the most delegates going into super tuesday as Cruz and Rubio are fighting each other for 2nd and 3rd in the polls. Cruz will do well in states that are more religious than average, and Rubio will do better in states that are more highly educated. In general they have some overlap in terms of demographic popularity. Trump\u2019s polling lead nationally as well as in the states proceeding super tuesday indicate that he will win the majority of the states in super tuesday. However he did have the polling lead in Iowa but still lost out to Cruz at the end of the day. The religious vote could mean a lot and it is entirely possible that this helps cruz win the majority of the votes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_religiosity\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/02/us/cruz-trump-rubio-nomination-paths.html\nhttp://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/nevada-republican/\n"], [20156, "2016-02-18T13:29:09Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.7], ""], [90, "2016-02-18T12:52:10Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4], ""], [18874, "2016-02-18T12:41:13Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.35, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.45], "Populate vote numbers & actual delegate votes are two separate shoes.

Who will win how many in each state is unknown.  The situation is complicated because the GOP made changes to the primary format since the last presidential race.  Essentially, it was thought that if a Republican nomination got wrapped up too quickly, while a Democratic race continued, the Republicans would be shut out of the news cycle.  To counteract this possibility, the early state contests were designed to be proportional, rather than winner-take-all, making it difficult for anyone to walk away with it early.  So my methodology for this question involves going through the contests state by state to make an estimate of delegate accumulation for each of the candidates.  I take the known number of delegates available and apply the latest polling data to make the calculations.  Admittedly, this is where things get squishy.  In some states like Colorado, the polling is not recent.  And of course, I acknowledge the inherent problems of polling in today's world where many people do not have land lines and will not answer polls.  You can take the data and run the numbers numerous times with various tweaks and assumptions.   At the end of all this I estimate that Trump will end up with 43% of the delegates, Cruz will get 32% and Rubio will get 24% by the closure date.  The other candidates will be out of it. Perhaps this is also a good moment to raise a point about the time-value of forecasting.  The GJO format places a premium on getting the forecast right as far in advance as possible.  Yet in other circumstances, it actually makes sense to get it right as close to the moment as possible.  The Michael Lewis book \"Flash Boys\" offers such an example.  In the financial markets, you don't actually get paid for being right about things in the far distance.  You get paid for being right about things that are just about to happen.  This isn't to say that GJO is off base.  But I think it is important to say that watching an apple on a tree and making a forecast about when it will hit the ground (even during the time when it may be in flight) can be enormously valuable also. The super delegate question is another thorny issue (especially on the Democratic side).

Either way, I'm reading this as the end of Cruz's chances to do well in SC and on Super Tuesday, as I expect that many other \"big-time\" GOP members will start falling in line behind Rubio. Not only is Haley important because her state's up next on the docket (is it Saturday, yet?!), but she's also been talked about as a possible VP pick, so her decision to endorse Rubio before he's even won a primary/caucus is telling for how the party views the importance of this SC primary. I'll save analysis for the nomination for the other IFP, but just to say that on this IFP -- the one about Super Tuesday -- I can't see Rubio winning enough support in the states that are on March 1st to move past Trump.

In @sh517's helpful post (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/132384), it is pointed out that Cruz could easily get 100+ delegates from Texas. I agree, but Trump could similarly take two-thirds of Georgia's 76 delegates, as that state also uses the hybrid system with 20% thresholds, and it looks like Trump has a strong lead.

This bumps up Trump's likelihood to be ahead at the end of Super Tuesday. \n4) With Texas being Cruz's home state and leading by a considerable margin there (YouGov puts him +15 points, 538 has him +17 points) AND Texas holding the most delegates, this is a big advantage for Cruz.

I hope these aren't famous last words, but I highly doubt that this IFP will come down to Vermont, so we can probably ignore Vermont when gaming these out. Lastly, @Jean-Pierre's point about Cruz's chances for the delegate seem important --> https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/132011 Cruz can win the delegate count only if both of the following occur: 1. Ben Carson drops out. If that happens, it will help Cruz the most because they draw from the same pool of voters. \n2. Ted Cruz wins Texas by at least 5 points. I think the second is likely, but the first is unlikely. ~~~ COMMENT: I really think that these early states favo[u]r Cruz, but Carson is a BIG thorn in his side. As @Jean-Pierre said, Cruz's best chance for being ahead after Super Tuesday is if Carson pulls out -- preferably after SC -- or NV, for that matter -- Cruz can certainly pull ahead of Trump on Super Tuesday. if Carson stays in, then this IFP is Trump's to lose. So, given the short time frame of this IFP, and the gaming aspect of GJ, I'm going to go a little heavier on Cruz and then reevaluate after SC (or when polling starts coming in for SC/NV and the 20% threshold states mentioned above).

Trump blames Romney for super PAC attacks\nBy Eliza Collins\nFebruary 11, 2016 Donald Trump took a swipe at Mitt Romney on Wednesday night, complaining to a TV interviewer that the 2012 Republican nominee was attacking him via a new super PAC formed for that purpose. Trump, speaking to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, was asked about Our Principles, the group run by former top Romney aide Katie Packer that has been running ads portraying him as a fake conservative.

Here are some important figures to consider as we attempt to answer this question: 1) How far along are we?\nOf the 2,472 delegates up for grabs, we've only \"allocated\" 53 thus far (30 for Iowa, 23 for New Hampshire) and it's important to remember that we have only dealt with those states with proportional representation. See attached: http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/a-glossary-of-national-convention-delegate-allocation/  2) Okay, so how is the horse race for delegates stacking up?\nLooking through the details on both the Iowa and New Hampshire results, we can see that Trump indeed leads with 17, Cruz is next with 11, Rubio follows with 10, and then we're left with a mash of Kasich 5, Bush 4, Carson 3, and then three finalists bringing up the rear with 1 each (and in the process of dropping out). Notice in particular the NH results which show only 5 candidates receiving any delegates at all (Trump, Kasich, Cruz, Bush, Rubio). On the basis of momentum, I'm automatically eliminating any candidates receiving no delegates in the NH results. And, let's be honest, despite the press coverage of the granite state (which is huge), they have 23 delegates for the GOP candidate: that's 6 fewer than Wyoming. \nhttp://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/IA-R\nhttp://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/NH-R 3) What, if any, special situations should we be aware of in the NH race? \nWith Kasich's 106 New Hampshire town halls, he truly wins the \"A for Effort\" award in the GOP northeastern primary. He touts himself as the \"anti-Trump\" and won 28% of the Republican electorate in NH who said they were looking for a candidate with experience (45% of whom made this a priority: http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/voted-live-hampshire-primary-exit-poll-analysis/story?id=36805930). He garnered the most vote share from Republican voters with a higher education status (no, this isn't the bleeding heart Democrat coming out in me.. it's there but I'm trying to restrain it for the purposes of clear headed logic) at 22% for post graduate degree voters while his worst category was the \"only high school degree\" group at 9%. Kasich has made himself a viable national force, a target for donor money, and a potential cabinet option for a possible Republican President-Elect; but he won NH on the basis of an exceptional ground game & an audience in the northeast he is unlikely to encounter during Super Tuesday. I don't think it was a technicality; but if he chose to do 106 town halls in a state with only 23 delegates, I have to wonder what kind of tour de force he'd need to complete Super Tuesday. But again, he'll be around until just before or just after Ohio (his home state) where I'd think he wants to put up a solid showing as a springboard to whatever the future holds. So, while I'm impressed on a number of levels with his, well, level-headedness - it seems like an enormous stretch for him to poach the support he would need to in order to win out Super Tuesday. Since this is a question about who gets the most - and not a percentage question - I'm eliminating Kasich from my forecast.  4) What are the states in play & are they proportional or winner take all?\ni. Here are the remaining February states: \na. South Carolina (50 delegates: 26 at large, 21 Congressional district, 3 automatic). The rules here are among the most complex in the country. Suffice to say that it's built in such a way that they advantage the winner more than a strictly proportional method of allocation, but less than a strictly winner-take-all scheme.

Kansas (40 delegates: proportional method). http://www.scribd.com/doc/294701752/2016-KSGOP-delegate-allocation-rules 5) Wow. Okay. So, where do we start with all this? Do we need to become constitutional lawyers just to unpack each of those? \nIn a word, no. The Palmetto State will clearly be key to setting some of the early momentum heading into Super Tuesday, but the number of delegates are actually quite low compared to the onslaught we'll get the following week. So, while I think it's important to keep an eye on the polls, I also believe one of the most important indicators will be \"early voters\" vs \"late voters\": who are the candidates with the ability to sway the undecided? That's where the exit polls become key & where I found NH's results so compelling. The Donald won 48% of the early deciders (still a staggering figure), but he seemed to taper off by the \"late\" deciding voters, at just 22% where he tied with Kasich. http://www.cbsnews.com/elections/2016/primaries/republican/new-hampshire/exit/ 6) And so here's where we really need to start applying some data from the polls. We are still a bit behind with the new polling results, but so far SC looks like it is headed to Trump (it's still early): http://maristpoll.marist.edu/128-trump-leads-in-ia-nh-and-sc-clinton-and-sanders-competitive-in-ia-sanders-up-in-nh-clinton-leads-in-sc/. That gives Trump an advantage of (at least) 29 delegates and probably more based on their funky allocation method. It's not inconceivable he could end up with 40+, for example.  In Nevada, it's been several months since formal polling and, frankly, the results look a lot like Iowa did going in. But Sheldon Adelson's newspaper has just endorsed Rubio & it's no secret how important that kind of result can give a GOP hopeful in the state. I'm providing a benefit to Rubio on this one, but it's proportional - remember. So it's a slight edge, nothing more. http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/05/marco-rubio-is-endorsed-by-the-las-vegas-review-owned-by-sheldon-adelson/?_r=0 At this point, we've got 80 delegates with homes. I'm assigning 30 to Trump, 25 to Cruz, 15 to Rubio, 5 to Bush, 5 to Kasich. It's difficult to put Kasich that low after his NH showing, but I'm trying to be realistic with regards to the SC & NV polling.  7) Now for Super Tuesday. As you can see from the above, there are really a handful of states to focus on. Alabama, for example, is important not because of its delegate number, per se - but because of the method (winner take all if >50%). It's difficult to see someone like Trump not winning a number of these states where he is already running a strong grass roots campaign & for reasons that the exit polling in Iowa and New Hampshire have hinted at on the demographics front. We'll have more incoming data to digest, but it appears certain that Trump is slated for winner take all states in a number of key regions. That makes him a viable threat. But what I think is key is Texas, making up a significant % of the Super Tuesday votes.  Recent polling has been strongly in favor of Cruz. For Super Tuesday, I think that's critical. Trump gets some benefit of the doubt in certain states where his demographic target base plays a major focus, but this isn't a question about who wins the nomination, ultimately. It's a question about the delegates by Super Tuesday. And, I do not equate Super Tuesday with the nomination - by any stretch. It's important, but it also could, depending on the results, end up dramatically reshaping the political narrative. I could see Cruz picking up close to 100 delegates in Texas alone, and those are the sorts of numbers that will help swing the pendulum back in favor of \"who has the most\".  http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2016/01/28/cruz-now-leads-trump-among-gop-candidates-in-latest-ktvt-cbs-11-dixie-strategies-texas-poll/\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/296491062/CBS-News-Battleground-Tracker-Texas-January-2016 8) Finally, and I can't stress this enough, I don't think that Super Tuesday equates to \"who wins the nomination.\" In normal election years, it would be an enormous positive, but - this time around especially with the \"establishment\" & \"anti-establishment\" candidates in such forceful positions, I think it could come down to the wire - long after Super Tuesday closes. It will be important, certainly. But it's not The End. On the basis of the states listed above & the polling data we have available, courtesy of RealClearPolitics: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president/republican_primary_polls.html, I'm assigning a 70% probability to Cruz, a 25% probability to Trump, a 5% probability to Rubio coming out on top after Super Tuesday. I'll look to reevaluate following the SC & NV results..
