If possible and desired. There is a large number of companies and start-ups (mentioned about 70 [3]) working on making LiDAR better and cheaper, but it seems a lot of focus is in cheaper ([2, 4]). Also, I found this interesting: \"Some experts believe the key to building lidar that costs hundreds of dollars instead of thousands is to abandon Velodyne's mechanical design\u2014where a laser physically spins around 360 degrees, several times per second\u2014in favor of a solid-state design that has few if any moving parts. That could make the units simpler, cheaper, and much easier to mass-produce.\" [2]. Other companies are using alternative technologies, like Innoviz [5] with range up to 250m, Luminar [6] further than 200m, and Quanergy [7] 100m, other sources cited 200m [8] (source [2]). From [2]:\n\"[...] that's significant because experts believe that fully self-driving cars will need lidar capable of detecting objects 200 to 300 meters away.\nJim McBride, a Ford executive who organized a team for the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, explained why in a September interview with Ars.\nMcBride said to imagine a self-driving car that wants to merge into traffic moving at highway speeds. \"Traffic is moving probably 60 miles per hour, roughly 30 meters a second,\" McBride told Ars. \"Most cars will take 6 to 10 seconds to get up to highway speed.\" So a car will want to be able to see cars that are 6 to 10 seconds\u2014or 180 to 300 meters\u2014away.\" The question is specifically referring to Velodyne, so my  guess is that the company's strategy in this increasingly competitive market with different alternatives is about reducing cost to an affordable price [4] AND better performance. We have to consider this as a longer term goal though (75%). So, is it technologically possible? 99% YES\nIs it a game stopper for the industry? It would add a comparative advantage to gain clients, so 100% YES\nIs it strategic for Velodyne's? Not top priority probably, but YES 75%\nIs it in the question's timeframe? Say 95% YES. I assume technology improvement when there is a economic motivation. Total 71% \nToo long a comment, sorry.
