I stated that there is an 80% chance that the gross income for the movie No Time to Die will exceed Skyfall, then a 20% chance that it will be as much or less, then a 5% chance that the movie will gross less than Spectre. Skyfall made $88,364,714 in the first weekend of the showing. The reason that I believed that No Time to Die would exceed this is based on the UK\u2019s first weekend showing gross income. The UK made about 28,891,250 in the first three days of releasing the movie No Time to Die. The reason that this is so big is because of the fact that the UK\u2019s market size is extremely smaller than the USA. This is huge because of the fact that it leaves more of a prediction that the box office income will be extremely high coming into the first weekend of this movie. Another reason that I chose that the movie would exceed Skyfall is due to the fact that it is Daniel Craig\u2019s last time acting as the character James Bond in the movies. People are most likely going to be more inclined to attend the first weekend's showings of the movie due to the fact that is the last time to see him premier in a James Bond movie. Due to these different facts, I believe that at the end of the first weekend, No Time to Die will outsell sky fall.

Whereas Spectre\u2019s opening weekend grossed at \u00a319.8 million in the UK and Skyfall\u2019s grossed at \u00a320.2m, No Time To Die dwarfed both with an impressive \u00a325.9m in its opening weekend (https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58788368). This shows that audiences are more than ready to head back to the theaters, as fear of COVID has greatly diminished in both the US and the UK since the COVID vaccine has become widely available to the public. In addition, some experts are projecting that No Time To Die could even surpass $100m in its opening weekend (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/no-time-to-die-eyes-100-million-domestic-box-office-opening.html). This is due to the huge opening weekend that Venom: Let There Be Carnage had, which grossed just over $90m in its opening weekend. This number is even more impressive due to the fact that the original Venom movie grossed just $80m in its opening weekend (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/venom-2-box-office-no-time-to-day-1235026486/). Venom: Let There Be Carnage beat its predecessor by over $10m despite competition from other openings The Addams Family 2 and The Many Saints of Newark. No Time To Die, in contrast, has much less box office competition. In addition, No Time To Die scored 84% with critics and 87% with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes thus far, compared to Spectre\u2019s 63% with critics and 61% with audiences as well as Skyfall\u2019s 92% with critics and 86% with audiences (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/james_bond_007). Clearly, audiences and critics view Skyfall and No Time To Die on similar levels- and both films seem to be significantly more well-received than Spectre. Since this is Daniel Craig\u2019s fifth and final film in the Bond franchise and it is the first Bond film in six years, it is clear to see why audiences would be eager to get out of the house and into the theater to see this critically acclaimed spectacle- helping it to surpass the mark of $88m set by Skyfall (https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/daniel-craig-s-era-james-bond-comes-end-no-time-n1280723).

Noting that the UK is about a fourth of the population of the US and that films typically perform proportionally domestically would lead one to believe that the domestic box office gross will be around or exceeding $100 million. Along with this, No Time to Die is Daniel Craig's last film, concluding a 5 film series. This suggests that there may be increased draw to theatres for Bond franchise fans, also being the first Bond movie in 6 years. No Time to Die as received high critic reviews, totaling 83% on Rotten Tomatoes which compares to 92% and 63% for Skyfall and Spectre respectively. It is also important to note that the audience score, 87%, is higher than the scores for both of the other films. With the supposed increased threat of covid variants, some may claim that covid may dampen turnout to theatres, however other films have done well in theatres recently despite the state of covid restrictions. For example, Venom: Let There Be Carnage made over 90 million in its domestic opening weekend, suggesting that covid hasnt had much grasp on the market recently. It is possible that No Time to Die performs worse than anticipated in the domestic market as UK indicators may not be wholly accurate; however, I believe it is fair to assume that the newest Bond film will gross higher than both Spectre and Skyfall in its domestic opening weekend.

Theaters are not a place people are fighting to get back into - this is a luxury of normal life and COVID means that it is going to take some time to get back to normal levels\n2. James Bond is well-worn and might suffer from burnout\n3. Bond is not a family-friendly franchise For:\n1. Daniel Craig is popular and this is his final stint as Bond\n2. All-star cast for villains and writing should make a more interesting film\n3. Social media buzz has apparently been lively\n4. Delay in production and overall lack of films during pandemic means people want to see something good - it's been 5 years!\n5. Daniel Craig has Casino Royale and Skyfall (supposedly two of the better Bond movies) to support his sendoff Trying to weigh all of these factors together, I come up with the most likely scenario being an opening weekend that is thoroughly solid for a movie, but not out of the park amazing. COVID is a serious thing to consider and only two films in 2021 have even grossed over $88M during this year and they opened at $31M and $47M on opening weekends. If someone is telling me that the film industry in 4 months is going to somehow start doubling it's take on blockbuster opening weekends, then I'd be curious what data or considerations are being used.

Many people are afraid of crowds even after being double vaccinated. In fact, surveys show people double vaccinated are more afraid to go out than the unvaccinated. After a year of being told to be terrified we can't expect movie turnouts to compare to pre covid. Many major movies are being released directly to streaming services. Poll conducted May 6-8. 46% of unvaccinated comfortable going to movies. 33% of vaccinated. These numbers will come up by October when the movie is released, however, we can't expect them to go to 100%. Of course, discomfort in going out to a movie does not mean they absolutely won't go to the movie, but I still don't think we should expect pre-covid box office levels. In fact, if a movie is popular and someone thinks that the movie theater may be very full of people this could be more likely to trigger their anxiety.\nhttps://morningconsult.com/2021/05/12/vaccinated-unvaccinated-americans-comfort-with-activities/ And also, of course, people have been going to the movies less overall.
