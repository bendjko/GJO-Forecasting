Although not likely, more major polls may make this a closer race again. I was intrigued by the poll done by \nEmerson College (survey date 29-30 July, weight 1.58, approval 45%, adjustment -1(44%)) which will probably prove to be the final coffin nail to this question. It's a poll among likely voters, but it's also included in the \"All polls\" segment. Towards the question of interest, they state:\n\"Regarding Trump\u2019s overall job approval as president, 45% of voters approve and 51% disapprove, a slight increase in both numbers from June (43% favorable /50% unfavorable). Among Independent voters, 42% approve and 55% disapprove.\"\nThis apparently is a monthly poll, but obviously the June 2020 release was not included by FiveThirtyEight; I wonder what it can be that made them change their mind versus the previous month. Among several ways to influence the result of a question asked in a poll, there is contextualizing. There are monothematic polls with a single question in focus - there is no context to take care of in these. Whenever there are one or more additional questions asked in a poll, there is a possible interference between the answers of the single questions, I guess. Convictions in the one question may trigger a certain mindset and subconscious reaction that leads to approval or rejection of the other question. Asked in separate monothematic polls the second answer could possibly look differently. I guess this is what happened in the Emerson College poll, although I don't want to insinuate intention. Here's the question set-up in this specific poll:\n\"Gender?\"\n\"Do you approve or disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as President?\"\n\"What is your party registration?\"\n\"In the November election, how do you plan on voting?\"\n\"If the Presidential Election were held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Joe Biden?\"\n\"Which candidate are you leaning towards at this time?\"\n\"Who do you think Joe Biden should choose to be his running mate?\"\n\"Is your opinion of former Vice President Joe Biden favorable or unfavorable?\"\n\"Is your opinion of President Donald Trump favorable or unfavorable?\"\n\"Regardless of who you will vote for President, who do you think will win the Presidential election, Donald Trump or Joe Biden?\"\n\"If the General Election for U.S. Congress were being held today, for whom would you vote or lean towards voting in the district where you live?\"\n\"On Monday, Senate Republicans proposed the HEALS Act, a stimulus package that includes a second payment of up to $1,200 for individuals making less than $99,000. Is this stimulus payment for individuals not enough, too much, or sufficient?\"\n\"The HEALS Act also proposes to cut enhanced weekly unemployment benefits from $600 a week under the Cares Act. Should unemployment benefits be reduced, increased, or stay at $600 a week?\"\n\"Would you support or oppose a national mandate for all individuals to wear masks in public where social distancing is not possible?\"\n\"In your opinion, is it safe for K-12 schools to open on schedule considering the coronavirus epidemic?\"\n\"In your opinion, is it safe for professional sports teams to play considering the coronavirus epidemic?\"\n\"Who do you trust more to provide accurate information regarding the coronavirus epidemic in the US, President Donald Trump or Dr. Anthony Fauci?\"\n\"Do you have a favorable or unfavorable view of the police in America?\"\n\"Has your opinion of the police improved or worsened over the past four years?\"\n\"If a COVID-19 vaccination were available by the end of this year, how likely would you be to take it?\"\n\"Who did you vote for in the 2016 election?\"\n\"For statistical purposes only, can you please tell me your ethnicity?\"\n\"What is your age range?\"\n\"What is the highest level of education you have attained?\"\n\"Please select the type of area where you live.\"\n\"Do you think that Earth has been visited by aliens?\" (140 out of 955 replied yes... funny, isn't it?)\n\"Region\"\n\"Mode [online vs landline]\" I find it hard to see any of the questions, except for the demographics, that is not highly controversial, and so I expect the answers to be given in a \"hard line mode\", where Trump supporters are supposedly more activated than others, when it comes to national mask mandate, HEALS act and Cares act money, opening schools,role of the police, and not least the credibility of Dr. Fauci vs. POTUS.\nSo it highly depends on whether or not the questions were actually asked in this order. If not, and if the approval question has been asked last, the answer will be likely influenced by the context. The order of questions asked is decisive. I don't see much of a difference between the two questions (maybe it targets at Job versus sympathy as a person):\n\"Do you approve or disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as President?\"  and\n\"Is your opinion of President Donald Trump favorable or unfavorable?\"\nResponders, however, did see a difference:\nApproval: \nMale  |  Female  |  Total\n232\t53,0%\t206\t47,0%\t437\t100,0% Approve\n212\t43,4%\t276\t56,6%\t488\t100,0% Disapprove\n19\t49,3%\t20\t50,7%\t39\t100,0% Neutral or no opinion\n462\t48,0%\t502\t52,0%\t964\t100,0% Total Approval was 437 out of 964 replies (45.33%) But: if 39 out of 964 replies (4.05%) are \"Neutral or no opinion\", is there really a value added by this survey when it comes to accuracy?

Given that most of the coronavirus epidemic and race relation issues have been baked into the current approval rate, between now and the approval rate on August 5th, I believe the prediction will change based on noise and/or unexpected news. For example, something unexpected that happened was Trump forcing Tik Tok to sell its US division, which likely ticked his approval rating higher. While it was known that there was general suspicion about Tik Tok Data and being used by the Chinese government, it was quite unexpected that Trump would come up with such an order. Due to my knowledge that I had no prior information that would really give me and edge in predicting this, I stuck close to 50% with slight bias to the rating being down due to his administrations response to the coronavirus epidemic. I will adjust my prediction slightly lower given he is now .7% above the cutoff.

Here the only explanation I find: The recent polls reflect a large portion of HOPE, and they reflect only approval on certain, very limited aspects of POTUS's presidency: Some topics, on which the incumbent  *appeared*  to have learned a lesson (until reality has proven otherwise):\n/The very fact that the WH has started a daily press briefing after months of absence; it reflects the HOPE that the administration will finally begin to take the virus seriously, work on a consistent strategy and finally present a science-based, consistent solution. As far as our common experience guides us, this will not happen.\n/The fact that the Republican national congress has been cancelled, is a very agreeable move, since everything less would have been crazy. The way POTUS argued (safety of the American people was, is, and will be his major concern bla bla), aand how he appeared to outvote the Republican organization for his (ostensibly) very personal concerns, made him appear almost responsible and sympathetic. I almost believed him.\n/The fact that he told FOX news he sometimes regrets shooting out tweets hot-handed, made him appear almost rational - that's the takeaway of some people polled may have been. What they should have taken away, is: he knows how stupid that is, but it won't keep him (or rather his propaganda social media team) from doing so.\n/The HOPE he's maybe speaking the truth about children being \"almost immune\" against the virus (the summer camp incident in Georgia proved the opposite)\n/The announcement of troop withdrawal makes him credible at least for a while, in a way the he \"does what he says\" (but only until you learn that the withdrawal of the F/A-16 squadron from Spangdahlem has obviously been scrapped again already.)\n/The announcement that federal troops would be withdrawn from Portland,OR may have sparked some HOPE that the days of cultural war in the US may be over and POTUS may be willing to listen to the other side as well (until you learn that federal troops will remain where they are, a few days later)\n/The fact that POTUS, talking about how he'd love to see everybody wearing a mask, just in case social distancing is not possible, now HOPEfully did his 101 on SARS-CoV-2 and understood the meaning and importance of it after months (just to learn that this still doesn't apply to himself and he starts fighting the mask war again shortly after).\n/POTUS personally kept out of the struggle for an extension of the stimulus bill, so all of the fail in this falls back on the Republican party (or the democratic decision-making process they're about to destroy) or the \"Washington swamp\", and none of that will stick to the president as a person, a self-proclaimed outsider... So in my opinion we observe the effect, that the unexpected, positive news (even though they're just unfounded announcements in some cases) stick much better than average news, and probably the later, contrary news - which represent the matter of fact - don't reach the people questioned in the polls at all. Or they are not strong enough to amend the picture in the people's mind for a while, until the final disappointment arrives. Secondly, unless the poll explicitly asks for an approval of his total presidency so far, they will receive a reply that is colored with the latest news, in a less dark picture overall, which are in fact only a very small island of HOPE in some aspects in a very large sea of denial, lies and fail. My guess is, quite naturally people will be driven to cling to that small island instead of admitting to themselves they're in fact left alone, swimming in the open sea of his presidency overall. A good portion of distraction helped him wind out of more urging topics this week, too:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te4zcrttUD0 IBD/TIPP (survey date 26-28 July, weight 2.03, approval 39%, adjustment +2(41%))\ncame in with a high weight and an unexpectedly high upward adjustment of +2, but that's no wonder if you ask investors and stock owners these days: he promised an economic comeback, and he (or rather Wall St greed) kept his promise (if you take the stock markets, not the personal financial situation of many as a benchmark). Investors don't care about fatalities on Main St. Emerson College (survey date 29-30 July, weight 1.58, approval 45%, adjustment -1(44%))\nis another thing that I haven't expected this way: a rather high weight for such a small poll (probably due to the A- rating), and it's rare (and inexplicable) to see a 45% downgraded by just one percentage point. IPSOS (survey date 27-28 July, weight 0.66, approval 38%, adjustment +1(39%))\npoints to another direction, but is singular at the moment and too lightweight to counter. I decided to expect more of the heavy polls above 1.5 weight in the days  before 05 August 2020, and thus raise my probability a bit until it's proven otherwise.\nRight now, he (or rather his Florida residence in Palm Beach) is in the eye of the storm, very un-metaphorically; but the storm is still there...

Based on my research, I think that the two key factors to pay attention to are the announcement of a potential covid vaccine and his poll numbers versus Biden. The first, while not directly related to him, has been a huge potential catalyst for his campaign that would be spun into a story about how he will curb the rising cases and reopen the economy, all good news for him. However, the chance of good news being released in the next week or so is low given all the information being released already. Second, his poll numbers have been steadily declining, which many of his followers openly remarking (both publicly in media and in polls) that his handling of covid is poor. However, it has been remarked that the 40% approval line is one that he's been defiantly above since early 2018, failing to fall below it since then, so it would take some major screw up for it to break through. Therefore, I'm not confident it will be below 40.5%, but it will be somewhat likely.

In particular, I just learned about the Monmouth poll, which comes out around the end of the month, and is weighted heavily in the 538 poll.

Currently, Donald Trump's approval rating is 40.2%, 0.3 percentage points lower than his rating on July 1, and been around there these last few days. The last few days of samples or so suggest that there's roughly a standard deviation of about 0.3% daily. Assuming random walk, on IID of 9 remaining days of samples, we might expect to see a total standard deviation of 3*0.3=0.9. Seeing an approval rating of  >= 40.5% on August 5 is then approx 37%.  This means my base rate is approx 63%. However, the additional factors I need to consider my probability distribution. I think that this isn't just a standard normal distribution about 40.2. There's probably some component of mean reversion as the effects of covid/unemployment are lessened. However I don't think this should be factored in because there's only 9 days until this is realized and should not then affect his approval rating by more than 1 percentage point. Since 2019, the average approval rating has been around 41, with a 3 percentage point drop since April of this year. Computing a rolling average of sorts would be a better indicator of his approval rating which appears to be on the downward trend which only furthers my belief that he will have a lower approval rating. Lastly, I think there is the possibility that there is some swing in Trump's favor if there is positive news about employment/ stimulus package/ vaccine news. However, Congress's fiscal package agreement for the next round of the CARES Act isn't scheduled to even begin until August 8th and Vaccine news has already been positive this past week without positively affecting trump's rating. Both are likely to increase trump's approval rating but both won't be realized until after August 5th.

I believe Trump's approval rating on August 5 will be lower than July 1 for a few reasons, as outlined below. Base Rate / Reference Class: A time series of approval ratings closely models a random walk, especially over short-term horizons - in fact, some real models use this as a component. A simple way to obtain a starting estimation of the approval rating ending up lower on August 5 would be to parameterize the movement of Trump's approval rating as an arithmetic brownian motion with  mean   = 0 and a standard deviation equal to the volatility of the last 30 or so samples. Eyeballing the time series, approval ratings appear to be in a low volatility regime and operate at a standard deviation of about 0.1-0.2% daily. To account for regime change and misestimation, we will use the max sampled std dev of 0.2%. Then, with 10 days left to July 5, the change in approval rating is the sum of 10 normal random variables, with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of sqrt(10) * 0.2 ~= 0.65. Then, seeing an approval rating of >= 40.5% would be a 0.3/0.65 standard deviation event, with a probability of about 32%, giving a 68% chance of seeing an approval rating < 40.5%. However, since 538 only reports 1 decimal, this actually becomes a 0.25/0.65 standard deviation event, giving a probability of about 0.65 for the question. The points below justify this use of the higher-than-sampled standard deviation. Downwards adjustments (to probability):\n- non-zero mean : My current macro opinion on Trump's approval rating puts the mean of the distribution of daily change at slightly less than 0 in the short-term, but potentially slightly positive into August - Trump may take a small hit from his in crowd after committing to wearing face masks, but should see a small jump with the economy picking up and a new stimulus bill on the way. In addition, historical ratings (earlier in the presidency and for other presidents) show support around these levels, with little room to drop but a lot of room to rise. Fundamentally, this is because as the approval rating drops into the 30s, normally committed members of the Republican party and former Trump fans would have to change their minds due to the polarized nature of US politics\n- the marginal disapprover: in order for the approval rating to decrease further, core supporters of the Trump/Republican base would have to defect - this is highly unlikely, and operates at a much lower probability than the middle of the political spectrum, that tends to be economically driven and most likely explains most of President Trump's (approval rating) fall.\n- regime change : this low volatility regime is not guaranteed to remain, and any large enough catalyst could increase the inputted standard deviation - look for the passing of the new stimulus bill or better economic conditions to possibly cause this - since I am short the tail, any increase in variance hurts my probability estimate, thus i must revise downwards. Upwards adjustments:\n- mean-reverting, low volatility regime :  I overestimated the standard deviation to give a cautious probability, but if this regime remains intact then the probability should actually be higher, much closer to 90%. However, the upwards adjustments described above justify the lower probability given, as simply substituting a higher standard deviation is a proxy for factoring in probability of regime change Major risks:\n- Vaccine or therapy comes out, the economy picks up and millions of people regain jobs\n- "], [88010, "2020-07-27T03:20:52Z", [0.77], ""], [783, "2020-07-27T02:14:12Z", [0.91], ""], [783, "2020-07-27T02:12:22Z", [0.9], "The question if he will withdraw because of bad polls is making its rounds.

From the relatively stable values of the approval and disapproval ratings over the past 4 years (start of Trump's presidency), it would seem like some mean reversion would occur and improve Trump's approval rating. However, as of July 26 (just 10 days out from the 5 Aug date), we are currently sitting at 40.2%. Given the linear trend since Covid occurred in rising disapproval and losing approval Trump has experienced due to the terribly inefficient administrative response to the virus outbreak, and since we're still in this phase with no immediate signs of turning the US outbreak around, the mean-reversion argument from before is much less important since the cause for the perhaps linear regime is still in place. However, it's also probably a good idea to weight the linear downward trend with the assumption that approval ratings also follow some sort of noisy random walk, given the patterns that are present in the graphs of previous presidents over time and accounting for massive news or global events that would sway approval in one way or another. On top of this, if we also assume just like in the previous 3 years there's an almost \"mental cap\" setting the lower floor at 40% approval rating (every time the approval rating has dipped below 40%, it has risen back over quickly), the random walk with downward linear drift between 40% and 40.5% can probably be some weighted average of simple random walk movement and approximating as (40.2-40)/(40.5-40) = 2/5 chance of hitting 40.5 first before the lower floor of 40 and weighted with some linear trend, we can say there's roughly a 60% + (100 - 60) * 3/4 = 90% that Trump's approval rating will be lower on 5 Aug. We can maybe further decrease a little bit since there are tail events that might occur, such as sudden vaccine news that would be reflected in the stock market and hence reflected in Trump's rating as well, or there could be an event of US handling covid better than expected in some end-of-month / beginning-of-month announcement in July, Aug. respectively that bolsters the ratings.

Others of the July surveys have a large weight, but are supposed to be special in their audience or scope (e.g. Universities), or expected to be less frequent than biweekly, and thus less reliable as a factor, such as\nQuinnipiac University (survey date 9-13 July, weight 1.76, approval 36%, adjustment +2 (38%))\nRedfield & Wilton Strategies (survey date 9 July, weight 1.02, approval 41%, adjustment +1 (42%))\nDemocracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape (survey date 2-8 July, weight 1.21, approval 39%, adjustment -+ (39%))\nResearch Co. (survey date 1-2 July, weight 1.36, approval 40%, adjustment -+ (40%)) For the next 15 days I expect 2 or 3 more major surveys to be published, with one being done by FOX News around end of July. While this single survey will dilute the general sentiment upwards in the short term, it will depend on whether the one or two others will come out with an adjusted approval of 40.0% or less to outweigh the influence of the FOX News survey.\nThe other major surveys that will be published before 05 August 2020 with a weight of 1.00 or more will likely vary between an adjusted approval between 38% to 42%, and the outcome of the question will also depend on whether those with 40.0% or less outnumber those with 41.0% or more.\nIt seems significant to me that two of the above mentioned, done by Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape (at 39%) and Research Co. (40%), did not need to be adjusted, so 39.5% seems to be the current sweet spot in approval surveys for POTUS, where the true image is revealed. All other surveys with a weight of 0.5 or less are good for informational value to reveal the whole political spectrum there is, but will not have any dramatic impact on the approval rate as of the question. It is more difficult to interpret those surveys with a weight 0.5<x<1.0, but it seems there's a tendency towards higher volatility (IPSOS e.g. has three surveys in this range after 30 June 2020 with increasing weight and an indifferent outcome of 40%, 39% and 41% adjusted approval respectively, probably 40.3% on weighted average.)\nWith very few important outliers, e.g. Morning Consult (survey date 6-12 July, weight 0.95, approval 39%, adjustment -1 (38%)), there's a general tendency in this group for an outcome of 40% adjusted approval or less. /There is no clear tendency, in which the adjustments overall are directed, but for the most part one can state that adjustments are recently made by one percentage point and are often directed upwards unless the survey outcome is 42% or higher. This suggests a slight upward skew of adjustments towards a \"less bad\" approval rate so far.\nFor the next 15 days, the outcome of this question will thus also depend on a possible shift in the size of adjustments (zero or two percentage points more frequently, which reflects a measure of certainty of the underlying surveys) and in the limes of adjustment necessity (whether or not surveys with 41% outcome or less will in the future be adjusted downwards more frequently).\nWill be interesting to follow. My guess is the heavily weighted polls will draw down the index towards 39.5 to 40.0% adjusted approval.

First, Trump's current approval rating on 538 is 40.6%, which is higher than the 40.5% it started at in July, meaning that if everything holds constant, he ends up with a higher approval rating than July 1 (also, a final number of 40.5% would also be \"No,\" because the question asks if the approval rating will be lower than Jul 1, not lower than or equal to Jul 1). A couple other reasons to consider \"No\":\n1) Shuoyi's argument below suggests a \"Momentum Factor\" in the polls: new information isn't factored into all polls at the same time, because different polls occur at different times. I know that he used this argument to explain why the number would continue to drop, but if Trump's approval is now higher than a week or two ago, some of the more frequently updated polls (which are more likely to be updated in the next week or two, before the Aug 5 deadline) could see a slight uptick. I believe that overall sentiment with respect to important contemporary political factors (COVID, BLM) have already had sufficient time to be reflected in polls.\n2) People's general lack of number sensitivity means that increased death rates won't hurt Trump's approval rating. In the classic example, most people wouldn't pay more to save 100,000 ducks than to save 1,000 ducks. In the same way, I don't believe a large percent of the population gets angrier at 143,000 total COVID deaths in the US than at, say, 14,300 total COVID deaths. In this way, people aren't likely to change their opinion on Trump based on another increase in COVID deaths. Additionally, there have already been many increases in case/death rates in the virus, so most of the people who approve of Trump given the current rates most likely won't change their mind from another uptick. In the slight event of a decrease in rates, it's even possible that his approval rating will go up (because the people who are more number sensitive, mentally correlating death rate with personal Trump approval, are most likely already \"not approving\" in the poll). Given the details in this post alone, my prior would be somewhat lower (maybe 35-40%). However, I also agree with many of the points of my teammates below, most of which favor \"Yes,\" so my new forecast lies just a bit less than 50%"], [92794, "2020-07-20T17:26:00Z", [0.55], ""], [88497, "2020-07-20T17:19:37Z", [0.4], ""], [92791, "2020-07-20T16:43:02Z", [0.55], "First let's look at the inside view, considering what factors might affect Trump's approval rating.  The most important driver of media coverage (and by extension Trump\u2019s approval, though this is a complicated relationship worth exploring) would seem to be COVID news.  Trump\u2019s approval rating certainly lags COVID cases, deaths, and lockdown effects.  His approval rating declined steadily as Americans were subject to lockdown and COVID cases and deaths rose.  On the start date of this question, July 1, Trump was at his least popular in over a year, and lockdown restrictions were just beginning to be lifted.  Since then, there has been a very large increase in new daily cases, but his approval rating has held steady (as of writing, it was 40.6%).   I think there are two factors that will affect how Americans view Trump in relation to coronavirus over the coming weeks.  New cases in and of themselves are not necessarily bad for Trump\u2019s approval, but if a large increase in deaths follows the rise in cases, that will likely have a more significant effect.  This is especially true if the media narrative becomes one centered on hospitals being overwhelmed and blaming Trump for allowing states to reopen and failing to respond to increases in cases we are seeing now.  The flip side of this is that if hospitals are not overwhelmed and we don\u2019t see a very large spike in deaths, Trump\u2019s approval rating will likely recover steadily as Americans are able to return to a more ordinary life.  The biggest risk for a downtick in Trump\u2019s approval is if lockdown restrictions have to be reimposed.  I would estimate the likelihood of a spike in deaths or lockdown restrictions being imposed to be between 70% and 80%, giving us a base rate from the inside view.   Now for the outside view: Trump\u2019s approval rating has been remarkably resilient since he took office, hovering between 40% and 43% since early 2018 (though it did sink below 37% at the beginning of his term).  Based on this, it seems as though his approval rating is near a floor, where any significant further decrease would have to come from solid supporters (fairly unlikely given the increasing politicization of the virus response).  If this is the case, then there is a limited amount of downside potential, and variation will likely be driven by random variation and noise.  If anything, we would expect some mean reversion after the steep decline of the previous months.  This view would be supported by the fact that his approval rating is unchanged or slightly higher, even with rapidly rising cases.  Between mean reversion and random variation, I would guess that his approval rating is slightly more likely to be above 40.5% than below it.  Others have done a good job of putting some numbers to this, but I think 45% is a decent rough estimate.   Now how do we evaluate the relative credence we give those two views?  I think that given the historical consistency of Trump\u2019s approval rating in the face of numerous controversies, crises, and scandals, the outside view should be given more credence.  With each of these crises, pundits have predicted that this would be the one to really affect Trump.  This undermines my confidence in the inside view.  At the moment, I would give the outside view a 2/3 weighting, giving an overall forecast of 55%.   Things that would affect this forecast:\n- A sharp rise in COVID deaths\n- States looking to return to stay-at home orders and other lockdown measures\n- Any downtick in approval that would undermine the outside view or show erosion of his hardcore support base\n- Any other major events that would generate either good or bad publicity for the president"], [90446, "2020-07-20T16:21:09Z", [0.28], "- Historical data, (including historical trends of incumbents at this juncture,) Trump's individual approval rating across time of Presidency (it has been incredibly consistent,) and his approval ratings' overall resistance to the general political climate, (e.g. his responses to BLM, Riots and Covid have hurt him very little, in terms of percentage of approval,) suggests that his approval percentage is more likely to rise (very marginally,) than it is to fall.  - Sidenote: I also observe some equating 'approval ratings' with 'voting intentions,' as one and the same. They aren't. This is about the average person's perception of how Trump is doing his job; with this in mind (and especially in the context of recent events,) his hardcore base isn't going to 'fall off a cliff-face' when it comes to their approval/perception of his efficacy.  - At current trajectory (if all remains the same,) I'll even throw in a (tongue in cheek,) prediction of 41% (+/- 0.1%) by 5th August. *I feel individual biases will play especially heavily here, unless one immerses and acquaints oneself in the broadest pallet of alternatives."], [27661, "2020-07-20T15:50:58Z", [0.65], ""], [67232, "2020-07-20T15:48:36Z", [0.0], ""], [67609, "2020-07-20T14:23:08Z", [0.55], ""], [93072, "2020-07-20T13:46:37Z", [0.55], "There has been very little movement on this number since July 1.

He has been net unfavorable during his entire term. Over the past four year, he has presided over large tax cuts, the killing of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. In this calendar year, we have already experienced an escalating conflict with Iran, the worst pandemic in a century and protests over race relations in the US. The President has mismanaged the latter two, and public opinion has reflected this. Americans do not appreciate his disregard for wearing a mask or him tear gassing protestors for a photo opportunity. However, what is unique about his presidency is how irrelevant his actions are to his favorability ratings. About 35% of the country seems to see him as an infallible leader and are unlikely to disapprove of him regardless of his actions. About 40% of the country seems to feel the opposite way: they disapprove of him regardless of his actions. Because there is such a small part of the country that is able to change their mind. We are currently in the midst of a worsening of the coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump has been a large proponent of continuing with reopening, and nearly ignoring the virus. Flare up will undoubtably continue through the country this fall. Whether the public sees this a result of his actions is relatively unlikely. Unless the pandemic gets much worse than it currently is, I believe Americans have already \u201cpriced in\u201d a worsening of the pandemic. I do not think that the pandemic worsening will have a particularly detrimental affect on Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating. The coronavirus killing American\u2019s is relatively old news at this point. Seeing as Donald Trump has flouted masking wearing and exercising caution, he only stands to gain if he reverse course. I don\u2019t American\u2019s will hold his previous actions against him. He can (and has) switched sides and rewritten history before. He may very well do so again.  Donald Trump\u2019s unpopular handling of the Black Lives Matter protests from June is currently depressing his national approval rating. As these events fade from the forefront of the national conscious, I expect his favorability to \u201cregress to the mean\u201d, or tick up to their natural level of 41-43%. I think the \u201ctime decay\u201d of this event is positive; that simply by time passing, Donald Trumps approval rating will increase. Because of this, I think Donald Trump\u2019s favorability rating will likely slightly tick up from where it is today. The July 1st level was 40.7%. Currently favorability is at 40.5%. I believe that his favorability will tick up 0.05% each week, and in 55% of cases remain below 40.7% before the 10th of August\n"], [92815, "2020-07-20T05:46:04Z", [0.55], "Comment deleted on Jul 20, 2020 05:47AM UTC"], [92800, "2020-07-20T05:08:08Z", [0.75], "1. My teammates already shared some brilliant ideas regarding the \"macro arguments\" on this matter. I just want to raise some attention on the micro side of things: As of July 19, Trump's approval rating is back at exactly 40.5%, making the discussion of movement magnitude (volatility) not as important. If on August 4 we still have an approval rate of 40.5%, then the outcome would almost be entirely determined by micro movement and random noise. Although we still have 15 days for macro events to happen (new headlines), I think 15 days already fall into the range of micro movement influence. Let me explain this further:  There is a delay from sentiment to approval rating.The \"underlying asset\" of our prediction, the approval rating, is calculated by based on a (very large) basket of rolling polls that continuously come in. Some polls have significant higher weights than others since 538 thinks they represent higher quality data. These heavier hitting polls are not done every single day, and the results are published a few days after the actually sampling took place. Therefore, if the true \"fair value\" of approval rating is 40%, then we will only be able to observe it days later when one of the heavier hitting polls come in. I think this micro technical factor should be crucial to our prediction since the approval rate is so close to 40.5%. Specific to this forecast, the most heavy-hitting one is Monmouth University, which should come in at the end of July or start of August and could have a big impact on the rating. Generally Monmouth University poll has lower approval rate than the running number at the time, so it could be another reason for us to adjust the probability up. 2. Another thing I want to point out is the mismatch between Trump's incentives and approval rating. The objective of Donald Trump is to win reelection, which could be loosely translated to \"gaining ground in battleground states\". This is not the same as gaining approval rating (on a national level). This underlying \"utility function\" would define his behavior when choosing strategies to react to new development of news worthy events.

This stabilization after 3 months of decline probably means Trump's response to the BLM protests and coronavirus have been factored in for the most part.

First, the recent federal police crackdown in Oregon is the strongest action Trump has taken against the protests to date, but it is unclear if this will actually convert current approvers to disapprovers.

I would add that the crowd is currently 65% yes and I think we need to take that with the following grains of salt: \n1) The crowd seems to be focused on the inside view rather than the outside view. IMO the outside view is that this is more or less random and tends to revert to the mean; \n2) I de-weight the view of the crowd more on political questions than on less passionate questions. The crowd is made up of individuals who have strong personal opinions for or against Trump and that can lead to a bias for the outcome they desire rather than a dispassionate predictions. I would guess that the crowd is generally less accurate on politics than on other topics (although I would love to see if that guess is supported by data)\n3) The trend has been going down and I think this crowd, like any crowd, over-weights the recent trend.

"], [92805, "2020-07-16T21:08:32Z", [0.55], "Trump's approval rating has been on average 40% since he took office (according to FiveThirtyEight). The president's approval rating is largely dependent on a couple broad categories 1) Stock Market Performance (we see large moves in the market correlate to swings in the stock market) 2) Domestic Issues 3) International issues. \nIt's fair to say the biggest factors right now are the Coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter movement. As of 7/16, it's fair to say that Trump's stance on BLM has been factored into his July first approval rating. On the domestic front,  Trump's re-election On the international front, the biggest issue is Trumps immigration policies and policy against China. I feel that in 2.5 weeks, the biggest issue that will determine the approval rating is the Coronavirus outbreak.  I think a lot of the nation has realized his administration's mishandling of the pandemic and refusal to enforce medical advice has caused the disease to soar in certain parts of country. This is the main reason I see  his approval rating dipping below. As more and more cases/death get reported, I expect for the approval to get down. It is a well known fact that there are supporters of Trump that under no condition withdraw their support, but I believe that number is lower than 40%. Due to the lag in COVID precautions and an decrease in deaths reported each days, eventhough precautions policies have been taken, I believe we will continue to see the death toll rise, and consequently, Trump's approval rating. I am only 55% confident however because throughout the epidemic it has maintained at this steady level with occasional bumps. \n"], [67232, "2020-07-16T19:58:24Z", [0.75], ""], [67232, "2020-07-16T19:49:51Z", [0.5], "In the last 18 months,  Trump has only been below 40.5 percent about 15 percent of the time according to fivethirtyeight.com.  (mean 42.1 and std 1.35, one std down = 40.7 percent thus 83 percent of time above this; so about 1/2 * 1/3= 17 percent and a little less = about 15 percent below 40.5) Thus, the base rate could be 15 percent yes.   Yet, in the last few months he fell from 45.8 on April 4th to 40.3 today, July 16th as the virus worsened.    The lowest approval ever was about 36.4 percent.  However, the range between 36.4 percent and 40.5 is made of people, I suspect, who want to vote Trump as long as he does nothing really foolish like he has of late, e.g., asking people to drink a cap full of bleach or inject sunlight.   The coronavirus deaths and cases are also rising.   Trump approval seems to fall as these numbers rise and then levels out or increase a bit as they stabilize.   Thus, it is the change, not absolute levels, that move his approval numbers down.  There is a comment that I heard from David Plouffe in the last few weeks that I think most forecasters have not considered.  Namely, it is far easier to get back a constituency that you had and lost than one you never had.   The range from 36.4 5 to 40.5 was a Trump constituency better than 83 percent of the time so there the \"pressure\" to the upside is strong but balanced right now by stronger coronavirus \"pressure\" to the downside.  The upside pressure is a constant in that it does not vary, much anyway, over time.   This is likely the reason whenever Trump's approval rating takes a dive it seems to quickly bounce right back up.    The downward pressure caused by the coronavirus varies greatly depending the changes.  That is, the public in the range at issue is outraged by a change right after the change happens but then cools and Trump's approval rating rises, if ever so slightly.   The coronvirus has worsened quite a bit in the last few weeks.  Will it level off in the next week or two?  The deadline is only 20 days a way and the deaths projection in the ensemble forecast of Umass, which includes, I think about 15 coronavirus forecasts, has the death rates rising even faster in the next four weeks.   So it will be real close in the new few weeks.   Unfortunately,  I think the fast rising new case and death rates will knock Trump's approval rating below 40 percent (the unfortunate part is the new case and death rates.)   Afterward, I think Trump's approval rate will rise to something above 40.5 percent.  The only question is the timing.  For August 5th,  I think a range of 95 percent would 37 to 42, which has a mean of 39.5 percent.  A 50 percent range would be 39 to 41 which yields 40 percent mean.   A 25 percent range would be 40.7 to 40 percent with a mean of 4.35 percent.  So my most recent estimate were probably low.  Lets say 70 to 75  percent chance of remaining below 40.5 on August 5th.   I will decrease this number if Trump's approval rating only remains slightly before 40.5 percent or the new case and death numbers rise faster than Umass ensemble forecasts.  https://viz.covid19forecasthub.org/"], [88002, "2020-07-16T19:21:23Z", [0.9], ""], [88928, "2020-07-16T18:42:21Z", [0.46], "Minimal change half way through month.

However, the bumps and upward and downward trends in the rating seem to follow some beautiful fractal geometry (I am referring at the relative size of the maxima and minima and their distance in time), which might help to predict the likelihood of the downward trend continuing or the likelihood of a regression towards the mean, as hypothesized by @Dillyweed and which is also a likely scenario (particularly because crossing more symbolic marks on deaths might not have a large effect on the polls, owing to everyone already used to the new pandemic normal)."], [691, "2020-07-13T13:53:48Z", [0.77], ""], [92790, "2020-07-13T10:59:33Z", [0.65], "As of today, the approval rating stands at 40.4%, only very slightly skewing my estimate downwards.

While large demonstrations have subsided, any singular event of police brutality would surely enrage people and possibly triggering more protests. That's certainly bad for the number.

Since COVID-19 is probably the biggest driver for Trump\u2019s approval rate, along with social issues (e.g. BLM), foreign policies (e.g. China, EU, etc.), and domestic economy. Before COVID-19 breakout, Trump\u2019s approval rating is correlated with US economy (i.e. stock market), as Trump claimed one of his biggest presidential achievement is create a strong U.S. economy and lowest unemployment rate. However, after COVID-19 breakout, we observed an interesting pattern: Trump\u2019s approval rate initially increases and then drastically decreases. My explanation for this is that people who initially trusted Trump\u2019s virus response and strategies were negatively impacted and starting to lose faith in Trump.  Looking forward, COVID-19 is still the main driver for Trump\u2019s approval rating. Therefore, I considered the following factors to be influential:\nUpward factors:\n-\tEffective medical procedure/medications to treat COVID-19 patients\n-\tHotspot states enforced lockdown, new cases number decreases \n-\tBreakthrough in Vaccine\n-\tDevelopment in Contact Tracing \n-\tFinancial support to the economy through FED, Treasury, etc. \nDownward factors:\n-\tState continue reopening and people in recovering states like NY become careless\n-\tPeople surrounded by Trump get infected\n-\tPresidential campaign \u2013 no mask promotes spread of COVID-19 \n-\tMore cases create pressure on medical system, causing increase in death rate.  As a lot of the COVID-19 negative impact has been priced in in Trump\u2019s approval rating. Therefore, my base rate for Trump to have a lower approval rating is 30%. However, as there\u2019s delay in COVID-19 case report and death rate, I would believe that death rate to picked up and weight more on negative factors than positive factors.

I think that it\u2019s too simplistic to assume that, because Trump\u2019s approval rating has fluxtuated between 41% and 45% since the beginning of 2019, it must mean revert.

Comparing against other countries\u2019 current situations also may not be insightful as the US has taken a different approach from most countries where presidential ratings are beginning to return to normal. In addition, the forecast will resolve during the coronavirus pandemic so there is ample opportunity for new developments to change the results. These could stem from actions by Biden, changing number of new cases, financial market changes, etc. Ultimately, I would relate Trump\u2019s approval ratings to the economy. We saw approval ratings decline in April after a stock market decline in April. We are seeing economic recovery: stock market gains, decreasing unemployment, etc. I believe this may continue for the remainder of July and so Trump\u2019s approval ratings could increase slightly from 40.5%.

Much of Trump's unpopularity is baked in due to his extreme rhetoric, which he is now changing.  The extremist rhetoric of just the last few weeks was clearly intended to shore up his deplorable base even though it cost him with everyone else.   Reagan did this in early 1980, but by election day Reagan have moved far to the center.  Some tv commentators said he was almost a democrat by early November.  I disagree with that last part but he did move to the center after cementing his base.  Trump is doing the same thing, I think.  The only question is when will he move to the center.  I suspect with the election now less than four months away, it will be very soon.   Today, he claims he launched a cyber attack on the Russians in 2018.  I doubt it.   However, he is clearly trying to convinced the general public that is not wholly owned by the Russians.   He has not done anything to retaliate against the Russians for their bounties on American soldiers and hopes this will substitute for a response.    Trump also just announced he will sign a document that will provide a path to citizenship for illegal minors brought to US as children.  I doubt his supporters like this very much.  Therefore, this may signal a shift away from the extremist tone of his rhetoric in the last month.  If so, he might also do so with respect to his coronavirus pronouncements.  His current approval rating is about two points below his three and one-half year mean of about 42.5 percent.   The standard deviation was about two percent.  Therefore, his approval could rise above 40.5 percent easily if he made the effort. There has been a lot of speculation about Trump's \"floor.\"   I considered measuring his floor in a variety of ways.   I found a pew research poll that said 19 percent said he would be a great president and 18 percent said he would be a good president in his second term.  Is his floor 37 percent?   The same poll also found that 70 percent of his supporters were voting for him because they were for him rather than Biden haters.   Thus, is his floor about 30 percent (70 percent time 40.5 percent)?    I suspect Trump's  floor has levels.  Fermizing, the bottom 20 percent of all voters probably would vote for him if he killed someone on Fifth Avenue on live TV.  The next fifteen percent are staunch supporters who would change their mind if did.  The next five percent like his conservative policies, especially his judges,  but I suspect do not care that much for him personally.  The next five percent, 40 to 45 percent of all voters,  that is the subject of this question, are swing voters who lean his direction, would probably like to vote for him, but have their limits, which have been reached.   Thus, the 40.5 is at the bottom rung for this group.    Think about it a little more, his lowest approval rating was about 36 to 37 percent.  This is probably his absolute floor given his strength among those below 35 percent.   However, he only reached this level a very few times and only for very short periods of less than one week.  Hence, a higher floor of about 40 percent is probably about right.  I think he could rise slightly in the polls over the next few weeks to the 42 percent range if he keeps moderating his rhetoric, and actually does something, anything, to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.   We will see in the next few days.  Yet, the rising coronavirus death rate that will also occur in the next month and its related consequences to the economy will pull his numbers in a downward direction. Thus, the tension between the effect of Trump's better rhetoric on voters who would like to approve of and vote for Trump and the reality of his absolute failure to deal with the worst pandemic in a century will determine the answer to this question."], [93456, "2020-07-11T02:09:20Z", [0.35], ""], [80790, "2020-07-10T19:37:56Z", [0.82], "Older polls with higher ratings will count less in the average and it\u2019s unlikely that new polls will be sufficiently high to balance this loss, so it\u2019s mostly likely that in the next month the approval rating will continue to drop.

I was hoping I might be able to find a mean reversion trend that I could utilize.At the link I mention below, there's a discussion that shows that Trump's approval rating range hasn't been too high. This suggests to me that it is mainly confined to the range we've already seen; many of the 40% of people who approve of Trump are likely set-in-stone supporters who will continue to like Trump regardless of the next month's events. Argument for \"Yes\": Rather than mean reversion, maybe Trump's approval rating is following a momentum trend. I noticed that Trump's approval rating has declined fairly consistently since April, when the COVID outbreak escalated rapidly in the US. The virus most likely isn't going away in the next month, so if this pattern continues, his approval rating will decrease. I am no political expert so I don't really know how to weigh the arguments above. At the time of this forecast, it is July 10th, 9 days out of the total 35 from the starting date until the question expires. Trump's current approval rating on FiveThirtyEight is 40.1% (down 0.4%). This suggests I should pick yes with probability greater than 50%. This also slightly weakens the \"no\" argument above: even if Trump's approval rating stopped declining right now, if it doesn't increase in the next 26 days, the answer to the question is still \"yes.\" As a very crude approximation, we can split the remaining 26 days into 3 \"9ish day periods\" during which Trump's approval rating randomly increases or decreases by 0.4% with probability 1/2. If two or three of the steps are a decrease, his approval rating for the period is lower, and if all three are increases, his approval rating is higher. If two of the three steps are increases and one is a decrease, then his approval rating will be roughly the same as it was on July 1, so maybe we would assign a probability of 50% yes, 50% no in this case. This gives me an initial estimate of 4/8 + 3/8*1/2 +1/8*0 = 11/16 or about 69% change that his approval rating is lower. This will suffice for an initial estimate.

The middle of this range is 41.35. According to Gallup, Trump's average approval rating thus far has been 40%. Given these two pieces of information, my prior is that Trump's typical approval rating is somewhere near 40-41.5%. 40.5% is close enough to the middle of this range (with weight given to the average). Therefore, my prior is that I expect Trump to have an approval rating of 40.5% and the probability of having higher or lower is 50/50.  Likelihood: I believe Trump's approval rating will correlate with the rate of infection in this country. Although I have not conducted a statistical analysis to support this claim, I see that Trump's approval rating was 45.8% before the pandemic primarily due to a very strong economy. However, the approval rating has declined in parallel with economic conditions due to forced lockdowns. The economic sacrifice needed to contain the virus is not something Trump or many conservatives were initially willing to make, especially for a party and a president  branded as \"pro business.\" However, the virus appears to have forced hard-hit areas, regardless of political affiliation, to shut down. Therefore, my assertion is that the virus will be the ultimate determinant of economic activity, and that the health of the economy is the primary driver behind Trump's approval rating and via the transitive property, the virus is the ultimate (at least near term) determinate of Trump's approval rating. So the question now becomes a containment one. I don't believe anybody in the world has a bulletproof answer/prediction to this question. However, I will approach this problem using the insights from the COVID Good Judgement question. In essence, I argued that once lockdowns happened, it would take circa 3 months for an area to reach week 1 infection rates. Given that even conservative states are now approaching lockdown, I will budget a month for them to clamp down in conservative states. Therefore, the 3 month timer will start in August 1. The general election is in the first week of November, exactly at the three month mark. However, by then, substantial economic damage would have been done, and I do not feel optimistic that a party built on economic freedom would have its more moderate supporters approve of such draconian actions. Therefore, I will adjust my probability from 50% to 40%.  Note that I realize a lot of the above is very wishy washy. There are assumptions built ontop of assumptions, and any structure of analysis can be easily contaminated by faulty inputs. There are dozens of unknown variables, such as the effect of rallies on Trump's approval rating, debate performance, economic recovery, vaccine progress/manufacturing/initial deployment, etc. I will not pretend that I am informed on this topic, nor that it would be possible for me to perform adequate research on each of these variables.

And if another stimulus bill is not passed by the end of this month, the wheels on the economy will come off next month as millions of people and businesses will not be able to pay their rents.  And Democrats are going to push back hard on some things Trump and his fellow Republicans have resisted, e.g. funding for election security, this time.  While Trump has a very loyal base, his base is steadily eroding.  The primaries are largely over and we are already seeing some Republicans jump off the Trump train, notably Lindsey Graham.  Trump's approval rating has been falling and is currently about 40%.  In the past his approval rating has been as low as 36% and change.

"], [67232, "2020-07-07T21:41:26Z", [0.95], "In a nutshell, Trump is not even trying to increase his approval numbers with the general public right now.   He started on July 1, with an approval rating of 40.5 percent.  The lowest approval rating he had in the last 3-1/2 years was 36.4 percent on December 16, 2017.  At that time, Mueller was investigating his relationship with Putin,  he was separating very young children from their parents at the border, Trump was supporting a child molester to be Alabama Senator and we had just learned about Trump's pornstar girlfriends.  If this is his floor, he has just over four points to go.    Trump's base knows he is a jerk.  To that end, much of the bad news about Trump's personality seems to be \"baked in\" to his low approval ratings.  So I doubt Mary Trump's book will affect Trump's rating very much when it comes out in a week.  Therefore, I do not think this will reduces his approval rating by more than one percent if at all.  It will not help his approval rating.  Yet, the coronavirus is getting worse.   Cities and counties are closing for the second time.  Fouci (sp?) says numbers could rise to 100,000 new infections per day. in a few months.  The death rate per positive test is falling but not that much.  In a few weeks, the number of deaths per day should rise.   Meanwhile, the EU has had largely defeated the virus as it continues to rage in America.  Again, there is nothing in the coronavirus crisis that will help Trump.  This especially true since all of Trump's public pronouncements about the coronavirus focus on how the 130,000 dead will affect his re-election, nothing else.  This could drop his approval rating by between one and four percent.  The economy is not improving that much despite the high stock market numbers and falling unemployment rate.   The stock market fundamentals are far off.  At some point, the numbers will come back down to earth; they always do; but, when?  The falling unemployment rate may stall or even start to climb back up.  The higher numbers could increase his approval rating by one or two percentage points.  Turn on the TV, and all the news is bad right now--except of course for Fox News.  The Black Lives Matter protests continue with a high level of support among white and even Republican supporters.   American is in chaos right now, not just due to BLM.  However, the people who watch Fox News regularly are already in Trump's base.   The Fox News supporters will not move at all.    All the bad news is fake news as far as they are concerned.    The bad news on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, etc. will continue and erode his approval level.  In a month, this could cost him maybe one percent.   The coronavirus is also bad news, but I addressed its effects above and do not want to double count it here.  I wonder how much the news about the Russian bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan will affect Trump's base as he does nothing about it.  I suspect not very much.  This will affect the general public, but probably not that much.  This could reduce his approval by maybe 1/2 percent unless there is more to the story that is currently known.  Trump's solution to the bad news problem seems to be to shore up his base by doubling down with racist comments, attacks on the media and insisting any Russian problems with election, bounties on US soldiers and spying are a hoax.   This should also reduce his overall approval rating while solidifying but not boosting his approval among his base.   The unemployment numbers will come out in early August.  I suspect they will come out just before the end date of this question.  They will probably show some improvement since the last two numbers also showed improvement.  At worst, they will be neutral.   It normally takes a few days for any new event to show up in the polls.   More importantly, the improving numbers in July and June do not appear to have helped Trump one iota.   There are events that could change Trumps low approval numbers.   Bush was helped by 911, and Obama had a bump after the killing of Bin Laden.  I do not see anything similar that could help Trump in the next five weeks.   I could be wrong."], [88500, "2020-07-07T21:37:56Z", [0.8], "At this point there are very few people who's favorability rating is subject to change, so any changes will likely be small.
