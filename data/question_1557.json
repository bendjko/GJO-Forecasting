WHAT I GOT WRONG Initially, this problem seemed to be a slam dunk, a no brainer, based upon what I remembered from my days as double major in math/cs and economics.  It was a 100 percent yes. I failed to consider a number of factors and just used what I remembered.  In US economic history, we learned that during the depression deflation was about two to three percent per year, and interest rates followed deflation down to about slightly above .56 percent in 1934.  However, the banks refused to make loans and were accused of hoarding money.  The situation was somewhat similar to the 2007 Great Recession during which President George W. Bush repeated the accusation.   In school, I thought about it and concluded there were probably two reasons.     The more obvious reason for \u201choarding money\u201d was the greater risk of default during a recession.    The less obvious reason was that banks did not want to become locked into long term loans with low interest rates.  Banks borrow short term and lend long term.   The interest rates on passbook checking accounts are much lower the interest rates on a mortgage.  Of course,  banks paid no interest on checking accounts in 1930s.  This was the source of funds for mortgage lending. Interest rates rise as the recession ends and gross domestic product and inflation rise.  A bank that made long term mortgage loans during a deep recession or depression later on could end up paying out more in short term interest to depositors than it collected from borrowers.  This was exactly the situation in the early 1980s, when many savings and loans went bankrupt.    I am still fairly sure I was right. I expected this recession to follow the pattern of the 1930s.  That is, inflation would become negative very quickly and interest rates, including the MBA survey rate, would follow this deflation down.  After all, it took several years in the 1930s for the economy to fall as far as it did in just a few weeks this year.  I was wrong because I failed to consider several factors.  WHAT I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED The real question is what is the floor for the MBA survey rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances in the absolute worst case scenario, which is what we are experiencing today.  What is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances?   I did not even ask this question.  A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with conforming loan balances is a mortgage on a single family dwelling that meets the requirements of Freddie Mac or Fanny Mae.  The main requirement is the loan amount must be less than $510k in most but not all areas. ($765k in certain high priced urban areas.)  The amounts change each year.  Banks prefer these loans because they are easier to package and sell and are insured. What are the Historical Baseline rates? I only have information for the MBA survey rate going back to January 2020.  The MBA sells its survey information going all the way back to the 1970s for $150, which I was not willing to pay just to answer this question.    The range for the MBA survey rate was 3.40% to 3.95, YTD; that is, from January 2, 2020 to May 21, 2020.  The mean was 3.63 percent, and the standard deviation was .1938 percent.  Therefore, the MBA survey rate has traded in a narrow range of .55 percent.  The MBA survey rate traded in an even narrower range in the last 60 days.  I used March 26, 2020 as the starting point.   I chose this date because the major effects of the coronavirus on the economy started about this time as evidenced by the jump in unemployment claims.  In this period, the MBA survey rate range narrowed to 3.40 to 3.49 percent.  The mean decreased to 3.44, and the standard deviation decreased to .0280 percent.     Therefore, the MBA survey rate has been fluctuating in a much more narrow range in the last 60 days-- after the effects of the coronavirus.  However,  the bottom of the YTD and 60 day ranges is the same at about 3.40-3.41 percent.  I was correct in that the MBA survey rate tracked the 30 year treasury rate.  The correlation between these two numbers YTD was  .9167.   That is, 91.67 percent of the movement in the MBA survey can be explained by movements in the 30 year treasury rate.  The range of the difference between the two rates was 1.53 to 2.26, and the standard deviation was .2504.   The minimum difference between the two rates YTD was 1.53 percent on January 9, 2020.  The greatest difference was 2.26 percent on April 23, 2020.   The lowest values for the MBA survey were 3.40 and the most recent number 3.41.  The MBA rate mean is 1.9276 percent above the 30  year treasury mean YTD.   Yet, the 30 year treasure rate is a lot more volatile.  The 30 year treasury rate range was 1.18 to 2.28 percent YTD.  The mean YTD was 1.6986 percent and the standard deviation was .4158 percent.  However, in the last 60 days the 30 year treasury rate range narrowed to 1.18 to 1.42 percent.  The mean decreased to 1.3011 and the standard deviation narrowed to .0793.  This rate does not seem to be limited by a \u201cfloor\u201d as does the MBA survey rate. The correlation between these number has grown however.  The range of the difference between the MBA survey rate and the 30 year treasury rate increased from a YTD mean of 1.70  to 2.24 percent in the last 60 days.  Thus, they are moving apart, and this is important.  The divergence indicates that the MBA survey rate has not followed the 30 year treasury rate to its lowest levels.  The MBA survey has hit a floor in the 3.40 and 3.49 percent range while the 30 treasury fell much further and in the last 60 days bounced around between 1.18 and 1.42 percent Thus, YTD and in the last 60 days the floor of the MBA rate has been about 3.40 percent, which it hit as the 30 year treasury rate fell below about 1.40 -1.42 percent.  It did not matter how far the 30 year rate fell below 1.40 percent; how long it remained below 1.40 percent; or, what the 30 year rate range was below 1.40 percent.  The MBA survey rate stubbornly remained at or above 3.40 percent up to the most recent MBA survey.   What is the Comparison to Great Recession and Great Depression?  I wanted to look at the MBA survey rates during the great recession and great depression for comparison.  However, I was not going to pay the $150 to MBA purchase their historical data just to answer this question.   Fannie Mae does the same sort of survey, which YTD tracks the MBA survey rate closely.  The Fannie Mae survey rate averages just under two tenths of a percent above the MBA survey rate with the standard deviation the difference of these two rates of .0875 YTD.  The correlation between these two rates is .96225 so the Fannie Mae survey rate is a very good predictor of the MBA survey rate.   The Fannie Mae rate bottom out in November of 2012 at 3.31 percent.   Therefore, the MBA survey rate probably bottomed out somewhere around 3.50 percent give or take one tenth of a percent near that same date. I would guess the lowest MBA survey rate for that period given the close relationship between the two rates was no less than 3.40 percent.   I found no data for mortgage rates during the great depression.    \tWhat Can I Conclude About the Base rate? I conclude the baseline or outside view of the floor of the MBA survey rate is about 3.40 percent.  Specifically, an MBA survey rate of 3.00 percent is probably .40 percent lower than the lowest it has been in the last half century.  WHAT IS THE INSIDE VIEW \tThe federal reserve has purchased about $350 billion in mortgage backed securities in the last few months.  This is less than the 500 billion of mortgages purchased in the Great Recession but that occurred over three years.   \tAlso there is the comment of lapp0 who works in real estate.  He stated that banks are raising interest rates right now.   This was borne out in the above statistics for the last 60 days.  This makes sense because banks will want a higher return and borrowers with higher credit scores right now, given the risks mentioned above.  This did not occur to me when I did my initial forecast. However, it provides a strong logical basis for the notion that the MBA survey rate has a floor.  \tThe banks have no doubt priced into their current mortgage rates through June 27, 2020,  the falling GDP, deflation, and rising unemployment rates we will likely see in the next year.   \tAll in all, this is the most unusual economy in our nation\u2019s history, but I think we are at\u2014or very close to \u2013 the floor on the MBA survey rates.  I expect there is less than 10 percent chance the MBA survey rate will fall below 3.30 percent and a less than 1 percent chance this rate will fall below 3.25 percent\u2014no  matter how far deflation or 30 year treasury rates fall.   \tIf someone knows how to post an excel spreadsheet, please let me know.

As of March 29th, $251B of mortgage-backed securities had been purchased by the federal reserve, with the intent of lowering mortgage rates, which was successful. However, the mortgage industry is pushing back because counter-intuitively these purchases are hurting lenders, increasing volatility, and causing margin calls. \u201cMargin calls on mortgage lenders reached staggering and unprecedented levels by the end of the week. For a significant number of lenders, many of which are well-capitalized, these margin calls are eroding their working capital and threatening their ability to continue to operate.\u201d[3] The fed has been reducing their purchases of mortgage-backed securities in response. We are seeing mortgage credit crunch, similar to what we saw in '08. This is likely not on the same level, but it will result in upward pressure for in mortgage rates.[2] JP Morgan has stopped accepting HELOC applications during the crisis, and raised its mortgage lending standard. This will have two impacts: proportionally more loans will be given to higher credit rated households (a downward pressure for interest rates), and fewer mortgage loans will be given over all (an upward pressure for interest rates)[8].

However, the mortgage industry is pushing back because counter-intuitively these purchases are hurting lenders, increasing volatility, and causing margin calls. \u201cMargin calls on mortgage lenders reached staggering and unprecedented levels by the end of the week. For a significant number of lenders, many of which are well-capitalized, these margin calls are eroding their working capital and threatening their ability to continue to operate.\u201d[3] The fed has been reducing their purchases of mortgage-backed securities in response. We are seeing mortgage credit crunch, similar to what we saw in '08. This is likely not on the same level, but it will result in upward pressure for in mortgage rates.[2] JP Morgan has stopped accepting HELOC applications during the crisis, and raised its mortgage lending standard. This will have two impacts: proportionally more loans will be given to higher credit rated households (a downward pressure for interest rates), and fewer mortgage loans will be given over all (an upward pressure for interest rates)[8]. JP Morgan is bracing for serious mortgage default risk [9]. The federal reserve likely will be able to stabilize the mortgage market, and continuing to purchase mortgage-backed securities to stimulate the economy, presenting a reasonable probability mortgage rates drop below 3%.

First - the number of people needing cash is going to boom.   The number of people applying for mortgages to fund their lifestyles while the epidemic rages is going through the roof.   So demand has surged.  Ability to service the loans has remained relatively constant.  So the ability to process loans is the bottleneck.  Increased demand with the same supply is a recipe for higher prices.  And with the cost of money low - this will be a good investment area.  All of this could reverse, at any time.

Since the Federal Reserve chair has stated that he doesn't think negative rates are appropriate for the US right now [2], that leaves the Federal reserve with limited tools to combat a future recession. This means it is possible that the Federal Reserve will increase its Quantitative Easing (QE) through additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities. However, this still leaves the issue of lending institutions not having the manpower available to process loans in a timely manner. Lenders could also be adversely impacted by the spread of COVID-19  and the CDC's recommendation of canceling gatherings of more than 50 people [3]. Further, the current glut of re-finance applications has created a possible loss of interest income for lenders that were not anticipated [4]. Ultimately, it will depend on the level of demand from individuals interested in refinancing their loans, the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce, and increased QE measures by the Federal Reserve. Thus, I am revising my original probability from a 12% to a 15% probability of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances in the U.S. falling below 3.00% by 27 June 2020.

I have been doing some research on this question over the past couple days and found the following:\n1. obviously rates are falling due to global growth concerns based on the impact of the coronavirus\n2. 30 year fixed rate mortgages are highly correlated (98% r-squared since 1990) with the yield on the 10 year Treasury\n3. The Fed's recently announced bond purchases (https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-purchase-treasury-securities-to-address-market-disruptions-11584109975), along with investor demand, should keep rates low for the near future but expect the short-end to fall more than the long-end (steepening)\n4. Lower rates make mortgage refinancing more attractive (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/mortgage-applications)\n5. This is putting a lot of stress on limited refinancing capacity (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/mortgage-rates-could-be-lower-but-lenders-struggling-to-keep-up-with-demand.html)  Now all of this begs the question of how low can mortgage rates go? Some reference European countries with negative govt bond and (in some cases) negative mortgage rates (https://themortgagereports.com/54915/no-floor-for-mortgage-rates-how-low-rates-could-actually-go). While a concern, I don't think rates are likely to go negative in the US given bank repo and money market functions in the US, negative rates would create more immediate problems than in Europe. On the other hand, the above-referenced article makes a fair point that mortgages have been breaking floors for the past couple years. This is where the charts come in. As I mentioned above to looking at the relationship between 30 year fixed mortgages and the 10 year (weekly data, end of period for the 10 year) since 1990 the relationship is linear and very strong. However, if I just isolate data points since Jan 2019 the linear relationship is still strong (81% r-squared) but there is strong serial correlation and a visual examination suggests that a quadratic equation would fit the data better (it does - higher r-squared and better t-stats). The quadratic suggests that as 10 year rates fall, mortgage rates fall at a slower rate. This indicates that a floor could be forming around 3.25%. To further validate, I looked at just data-points since the coronavirus started impacting the bond markets (mid-January) and the beta of my linear regression is significantly lower than the beta for the other two time-frames (since 1990 and since 2019). I think that this is largely due to low capacity to process refinancing applications and making sure banks can maintain profitability given the negative impact of low rates on their operations. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: This analysis is based on the Avg 30-year Fixed Rate US mortgage from Freddie Mac (not the MBA) since I couldn't find a free MBA time series to download.

The lowest the average 30-year Fixed-rate reached during that timeframe was 3.35% in November and December of 2012[1]. During that same timeframe, the 10-year Treasury Yield reached 1.626% and 1.742% respectively[2]. During the month of November, in 2012, Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac reported that there were 573,153 refinances processed. For the month of December, they reported 359,205 mortgages refinanced[3]. Also, during this time period banks were completing refinance applications in about 57 days [4]. Currently, the 10-year treasury rate has hit an all-time low in the past 7-10 days and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached an average of 3.47 for the month of February 2020. Further, the market is predicting a 95.6% possibility that the Fed will slash its benchmark lending rates to 0 during their 17-18 March meeting [5].  However, the 10-year treasury has gone back up to almost 1% and mortgage lenders have increased their rates by 1-3 points in the past 3-5 days. Further, some current lenders are allowing applicants to lock in rates for 100 days and many lending institutions do not have the staff to process the current workload due to staff cuts between 2018-2019 [6]. Thus, major lending institutions are actively keeping rates high to dissuade more individuals from re-financing because they cannot process the applications. Further, these processing delays could be exacerbated as school closures and travel restrictions increase. If any of the major lenders shuts down their offices, it will increase the processing timeline. With rate locks extending at least 100 days and lenders not having the manpower to process applications in a timely manner, it seems unlikely that mortgage rates would fall below the 3% limit, especially since that limit has never been reached. If banks are able to hire more mortgage processors/loan officers, AND, the federal government promises to provide additional financial backing for mortgage securities, the rate could drop below 3%, but both of those scenarios seem unlikely to cause a decrease to below 3% by 27 Jun, especially since rates are currently averaging between 3.75-4%.
