I've enjoyed watching the discussion around this one, and I take my hat off to the GJO crew (Thanks @amory10!) for creating an interface that encourages open discussion.  Some of the HFC platforms have much to learn still ... In particular, I find this question intriguing because, to me, this is about as slam-dunk certain as a question can be, yet two forecasters who I very much respect (@Anneinak, @shivadiva) are VERY guarded about about the prospects as an appeal.  In some circumstances, this might cause me to be much more hesitant.  In this case, I'm going to go out on a limb and say - sorry Anne & Samantha, you are wrong on this one!  :) Why the certainty on my behalf? Trump and Brexit had much of the commentariat going, \"Polling is useless!  This is the end of days!  The sun has turned to darkness and the moon turned to blood!  Nothing is certain anymore!\" But to put some perspective around that, the polls were fairly consistent in the lead-up to both votes.  Clinton generally had a lead of 3-5%, and Remain had a lead of 1-4%.  Both leads were within margins of error.  Both leads were _well_ within the number of undecided voters.  Now in some highly stable situations, a lead of 4% allows one to confidently predict a result.  [For example, in the Australian context, if one of the major parties can get to a nationwide two-party-preferred polling result of 52%:48% in the week or two before an election, they are HIGHLY likely win that election (90%+) and probably will win easily.]  However in the case of American presidential, and Brexit, polling, most commentators with a background in probability and stats were much more cautious.  Nate Silver gave Clinton about a 70% chance of winning a couple of days out (hotter heads were saying 95%+), and he refused to comment at all on the possible Brexit outcome.  [His words were to the effect of: \"It would only take a small bias in these polling results one way or another change the likely outcome of the election, and I don't know enough about British polling is done to know if, or in what direction, that bias might be.\"] In the case of the impending Irish referendum, we are looking at leads of 15-25% of Repeal over Retain.  Yes, the polling results vary quite widely, but at CLOSEST, Repeal still has an 11% lead.   In other words, Trump and Brexit were each like tossing a pair of coins and having them come down with a pair of heads.  (\"Wow, what is the chance!\")  To me, the Irish referendum is like tossing _7_ coins. And if, on Saturday morning, all 7 have come down heads and Retain has won, well, Anne and Samantha, you both know where to email my serve of humble pie to!"], [34405, "2018-05-22T19:38:31Z", [0.9], ""], [32602, "2018-05-22T19:07:30Z", [0.59], ""], [691, "2018-05-22T14:52:23Z", [0.99], ""], [58462, "2018-05-22T11:04:57Z", [0.75], ""], [23006, "2018-05-21T21:11:53Z", [0.51], ""], [58452, "2018-05-21T18:56:31Z", [0.95], ""], [41922, "2018-05-21T18:34:45Z", [1.0], ""], [41922, "2018-05-21T18:34:30Z", [0.0], ""], [1034, "2018-05-21T14:14:02Z", [1.0], ""], [11080, "2018-05-21T10:05:02Z", [0.9], ""], [38, "2018-05-21T06:36:40Z", [0.77], ""], [38, "2018-05-21T06:30:26Z", [0.88], ""], [34920, "2018-05-21T04:55:37Z", [1.0], ""], [19801, "2018-05-21T04:19:48Z", [1.0], "lead in the polls is so huge even if all the undecideds vote against the referendum will still result in a repeal."], [23006, "2018-05-21T03:37:22Z", [0.49], "- Yes' side losing support closer to ref date - whether those votes are going to abstain or 'no' is not clear.

It's also possible that in a country that is traditionally conservative on abortion yes might be the tougher answer to give to a pollster.

Excluding undecided voters, the poll finds 57pc to 43pc support repealing the Eighth Amendment . . . However, when undecided voters are included, the poll shows 45pc in favour, 34pc against, with a considerable 18pc undecided and 4pc who did not express an opinion. The survey also reveals that more Yes (18pc) than No (15pc) supporters have reservations about the proposed amendment.\nFurthermore, more men (21pc) that women (15pc) have doubts about the proposal. However, the poll overall finds some movement in favour of repeal, with strong support among young people in urban areas, and particularly among women in the lower-middle and skilled working social classes' cohort. A notable feature in the poll is an urban-rural divide, which shows Dublin (51pc) in favour of repeal, falling to 37pc in Connacht/Ulster. But the fact that a significant number are still undecided, and that somewhat more Yes than No voters have doubts, will see the campaign go down to the wire.\n. . . \nHowever, today's poll indicates that the referendum will be carried, albeit with a slim majority.\n. . .\nThe margin of error is 3.1pc. On the abortion referendum, in another finding which shows momentum for repeal, 42pc (up two points) say abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks is 'about right' and 11pc (up three points) say it does not go far enough, while 32pc (down one point) say it goes 'too far'. However, again there is a sizeable minority (15pc), down four points, who do not know or have refused to give their view. A further breakdown shows that slightly more Fianna Fail supporters intend to vote No (41pc) than Yes (39pc), while more Fine Gael supporters say Yes (44pc) than no (33pc) and more Sinn Fein supporters are also saying Yes (52pc) than No (35pc).\nAlthough this poll sample was smaller, and therefore comes with a warning, significantly more of the farming community support No (62pc) over Yes (18pc). Should the referendum be passed, the poll indicates that the strong support of young women in the lower-middle and skilled working classes, C1 (51pc) and C2 (47pc), will be significant. In the Sunday Independent today, Paul Moran, executive director of Kantar Millward Brown, writes that the poll \"will serve as a clarion call to all, as it illustrates that with three more weeks to go, there is still plenty of hard graft to be done, and nothing can be taken for granted\". COMMENT: Momentum appears to be with \"No\".  I'm reducing my forecast because I'm wondering what the Catholic bishops are telling the choir at church on Sunday.

The sole party actually against Repeal is the tiny breakaway Renua, which hasn\u2019t any MPs. The same goes for the press. Rather than list the pundits for abortion, it\u2019s easier to name two against:. . .

The Irish Constitution, adopted in 1937, is an emphatically Christian political document. Its preamble begins not with a gesture towards \u201cwe the people,\u201d like its American and Indian equivalents, but with an appeal to \u201cthe Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred.\u201d Its contents acknowledge \u201call our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ.\u201d\n. . . \nIreland\u2019s constitution has naturally evolved to respond to new challenges, but it has done so within a context that sees the Catholic Church enjoying overwhelming social advantages, controlling almost all primary and secondary schools, and commanding the loyalty of vast numbers of people. As late as 1979, during his papal visit, John Paul II celebrated mass in front of 1.25 million people\u2014one third of the Republic\u2019s population and the largest gathering in its history. Four years later in 1983, Irish voters adopted the Eighth Amendment, guaranteeing in all but the most extreme circumstances the right to life of the unborn. But the 1980s were a turning point in Irish history, marking both the high point of its Catholic society and the beginning of its end. Ireland\u2019s secularization was sudden. The legalization of homosexual activity in 1993 and of divorce in 1995 were both cause and consequence of a radical reformulation of sexual ethics in opinion and public policy. In 2015, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage on the basis of a national popular vote, and, in 2017, Varadkar became the country\u2019s first gay Taoiseach. Popular attitudes towards LGBT people in the Republic are now among the most liberal in the world; progressive policies are overwhelmingly supported by very large numbers of younger voters. Their attitudes illustrate how absolutely the Catholic Church failed to instill its moral values in a generation whose education it virtually monopolized, with the result that a culture that never embraced the Protestant Reformation is nevertheless living with its \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d As Mass attendance declines, it becomes ever more obvious that the Catholic Church lost the battle for religious adherence in the Republic, even if the Protestant churches did not win. There are several reasons that explain Ireland\u2019s rapid secularization. The impact of modernity, facilitated by an internationalizing media, has exposed the moral and cultural isolationism that prevailed for much of the 20th century. Patterns of migration and return encouraged liberal values among many in the middle classes. But nothing did the Catholic Church more harm than the horrific sequence of clerical abuse scandals, with consequences epitomized in such documents as the Cloyne Report (2011), which became the subject of one of the most important speeches in Irish political history. Then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny spelled out the reasons why this report, documenting the \u201crape and torture of children,\u201d had brought \u201cthe Government, Irish Catholics, and the Vatican to an unprecedented juncture.\u201d He condemned the \u201cdysfunction, disconnection, elitism,\u201d and \u201cnarcissism that dominate the culture of the Vatican to this day,\u201d and exposed the \u201cattempt by the Holy See, to frustrate an inquiry [into child abuse] in a sovereign, democratic republic.\u201d This, Kenny insisted, was not \u201cindustrial-school or Magdalene Ireland, where the swish of a soutane smothered conscience and humanity and the swing of a thurible ruled the Irish-Catholic world.\u201d Ireland had \u201cneglected its children\u201d for too long, and \u201cas Taoiseach, I want to do all I can to protect the sacred space of childhood and to restore its innocence.\u201d The government\u2019s response to horrific revelations of clerical abuse was to insist upon children\u2019s safety. Of course, there must always be a balance of rights, as the Eighth Amendment puts it, and of course there are always distressing and ethically complex cases that cry against the cold logic of legal doctrines\u2014cases about which participants in the campaign against repeal have not always responded with grace, kindness, or even basic humanity. But it remains dreadfully ironic that one Taoiseach\u2019s extraordinary defense of the \u201csacred space of childhood\u201d should be followed by his successor\u2019s call for access to abortion to be widened. Polling shows that a clear majority of voters are backing the motion for repeal, though this lead has slipped by nine points since January. A social media campaign celebrates those who are coming #HomeToVote, using the same hashtag that energized the campaign for same-sex marriage several years ago. The emigrants are returning to chip away at values that were once inviolate, forgetting to whom, and with what consequences, as the constitution puts it, \u201call actions both of men and States\u201d must be referred. But on May 25, the result of the referendum will almost certainly confirm it: Catholic Ireland is dead and gone.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I've read elsewhere that the Catholic Church hierarchy is not launching a huge media campaign.

The purpose of having any any policy written into a constitution is to prevent law makers easily changing laws in that area. It appears from opinion polls that most Irish voters think that there are circumstance where abortion should be permitted and there are circumstances where most think it should not be permitted. As has been pointed out there is considerable disagreement between voters as to what these circumstances should be. It would be reasonable to speculate that the opinions of voters would vary over time as different circumstances get fuller discussion and that science presents new facts. It is surely impossible to expect a constitution to be able to define all circumstances, which is why democracies have legislators who pass laws that fit the circumstances and the needs of the time and can be changed to fit the circumstances and needs of tomorrow or next year. Removing the Eighth Amendment would not be a vote for a free for all over abortion, but a vote to allow legislators to adapt to needs. If voters really do  not trust politicians to make good laws, it difficult to hold out much hope for democracy, they might as well hand over government to a dictator or require a referendum on every law. It appears that in the last twenty years or so Irish citizens have become more confident that they have a right (and duty) to vote for representatives that will carry out the people's wishes rather than as happened in the past, the citizen was expected to be constrained and directed by higher authorities. So I expect the Eighth Amendment will be repealed so that free discussion on what abortion legislation is appropriate, can take place.

It does not merely allow first trimester abortions as the citizen assembly proposed.  It instead allows the entire abortion issue to be addressed via law/politicians.  The Irish are justifiably skeptical of their politicians.   This proposed amendment removes the decision from the people.    I think the wording was a mistake; it will drive fence sitters against.  Ireland is still a largely conservative nation.   Support for the amendment has fallen from 70% to 43%.   The issue will get hearings in the Irish parliament relatively soon; the Irish government is still pushing for May 25.

According to the guarding 75% of unsure lean pro repeal.   However I don't think this is accurate.  I'm adjusting to 55%, pending further movement.    Contrary to the guardian, I think unsure will not break 3:1 in favor.    The government has been leading this process for years, people are relatively well informed.   Were this a clean amendment it would pass.   The issue the body politic is deciding  is if the legislation is the way to go.   I think people will rapidly form opinions for the next couple of weeks - and that any remaining undecided at the time of the election will vote no. I also expect a lot of promises and push to get over the 49% in the very near future.    TLDR:  expect steadily tightening.

The referendum on gay marriage inspires hope that they will be more progressive on this issue, but in places like Roscommon the vote was very close, and the country is looking at a deep divide on the issue between what could be considered the old guard and the newer generations that see abortion as a reproductive right. While same sex marriage was a close call in Roscommon, it was not so close nationally and same sex marriage won.
