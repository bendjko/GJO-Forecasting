Starting with the facts we know, OPEC has produced 26,000 thousand barrels per day (tb/d) in June of 2021, and has an existing agreement to increase production by 400 tb/d each month starting August, although myriad caveats leave this steady increase volatile (World Oil, 2021). Some interesting facts to consider are that the price of oil often has an inverse correlation to the level of production, and that despite agreements like the aforementioned, individual countries typically produce fewer barrels per day than planned (Kenton, 2020). With the rising price of oil, it is possible that member states of OPEC reach their goal of increased production at a more sluggish pace than previously planned. With that said, the planned increase would take OPEC production to 26,400 tb/d in August, 26,800 tb/d in September, and finally 27,200 tb/d in October, just over the threshold answer of \u201cMore than 27,000 tb/d but fewer than 28,500 tb/d\u201d on the Good Judgement prediction website.

In fact, they just re-affirmed all this in a statement last week, which boosted the price of crude to a 3 year high. Source: https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-seen-keeping-oil-output-policy-unchanged-opec-sources-say-2021-10-04/ This sets a baseline of no less than 26,000 barrels.\u00a0 However, OPEC is calculating and cautious. They will not flood the market and risk reducing prices. Furthermore, many of OPEC's biggest clients in China and Europe (according to Statista trade data from 2012-2020) are still imposing strict covid policies, which inhibit the amount of oil people consume for transport, as it did from 2019-2020. Most countries are not out of the woods yet with Covid, so any increase in crude production would face additional risk. Thus, the increase will be gradual from the ~26,000 baseline. Gauging how gradual will determine if production is likely to tip over that key 27,000/day figure. I think it is more likely to stay under 27,000, since prices are projected to increase up to $100/barrel anyway. Better to stay extra cautious and increase supply more drastically in a few months, if need be.

The wild cards here seem to mostly be Iran, Libya, and Venezuela as they don't appear to be subject to any OPEC quotas right now but still are counted in the OPEC production. This [1] shows a planned production increase for OPEC of 360 tb/d for OPEC for July. But as described in my comment here [2] that's not counting another 400 tb/d increase from Saudi Arabia which had taken an additional voluntary reduction. So that puts the planned increases at +760 tb/d for July followed by 400 tb/d for each of August, September, and October. Added to 26,034 for June makes 27,994 for October. But Iran is a big wildcard. Iran's oil production is way down due to tariffs, so if the JCPOA were to be reinstated by October and tariffs lifted oil production could potentially jump up there. Iran has been increasing oil production already despite the tariffs. [3] Overall the third bucket seems most likely followed by the last on the potential for an oil output increase from Iran.
