First, is that as the process moves forward, and more people are allowed inside the bubble, everyone becomes complacent and the number of positive tests increase. This would be especially damaging if several high profile athletes were hit with positive tests or opted not to play because of increased positivity rates. The second issue is outside the control of the NBA. If we see a continuation of increasing numbers in Florida an the rest of the country the NBA may come under social pressure to stop playing. This would be an issue if complaints about the number of tests teams receive become a story as local populations are unable to secure testing.

Compared to other American professional leagues, I believe the NBA is taking the risks seriously. Potential delays to finishing by 10/15 would be an outbreak within the bubble. Based on testing protocols and how they are keeping teams apart, I believe that an outbreak involving multiple teams is unlikely. It is possible a team might have multiple cases, but I believe the league will stick to it's word and isolate those players, forcing a forfeit of games, if necessary.  Also, because of the planned schedule for next season (draft, free agency, training camps, and start of season by Christmas). The NBA needs to stick to it's schedule for the remainder of this season to stick to that offseason schedule. Therefore, even if their are delays or minor issues, I believe the response would be to compress the current schedule (possibly reducing playoffs from 7 to 5 game series) to ensure that it finishes on time.
