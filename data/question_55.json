It's also true that Malaysia is facing a weak growth with revenues down due to oil prices and could possibly face a fiscal slippage . Moreover, Malaysia had recently a credit rating downgrade. However, it's important to notice that Prime Minister Najib Razak is, at the very least, sending messages to market agents that he is gonna taking the right measures. An example is that last year budget-deficit reduction was met and measures to boost private spending are taking place. Moreover, US are not elevating its interest. Thus, as a consequence Malaysia ringgit rose for five days already and today is the best performing emerging market currency. On top of that, ten-year sovereign bonds rose, pushing the yield down and there was a rally on brent crude. In a nutshell, things are looking better for Malaysia!! However, it all depends on what will happen to China.

Also, given the recent emerging market turmoil as a result of China's troubles, it's possible capital controls could be imposed before 1 October, especially if capital continues to flow out of emerging markets, including Malaysia (despite what the government has promised).  Still, it would be a drastic measure borne out of desperation but I'm giving it a higher probability than I would for other countries given the reasons above.

To be honest, this was the real problem in Malaysia and the only reason capital control was taken off the table was the assurance of a market rebound with China. That is my guess.  The fact that capital control came up so often in conversation tells me that it was highly considered and discussed. What if China's stock market hadn't rebound in July? I think they would have imposed a capital control. I think as long as China's stock market remains relatively stable, Malaysia will not impose a capital control, but if it suddenly plummets, all bets are off.  Will China's stock market crash?
