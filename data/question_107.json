Assuming that the economy returns to a recession on average once every 6 years, this gives a probability of 17% that a recession will occur in any given year. Citi (http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-watch-for-us-recession-zero-interest-rates-in-china-next-year-citi-says-2015-12?r=US&IR=T) predict a probability of 65% of a recession in 2016, although my expectation is that this is punchy given the fed's optimism about the economy. I would still expect the probability in 2016 to be greater than 17%, so lets meet in the middle at 41%.

Indeed, a crucial cause of the split is that the sectors that have been hardest hit \u2014 manufacturing and energy production \u2014 nowadays count for much less in terms of employment than they do in output. \"The nation\u2019s vast array of service industries, which are more labor-intensive, are actually doing far better, . . . .  And the thriving, domestically driven sectors like restaurants, health care, and professional and business services are serving as a firewall protecting the American economy from growing turbulence overseas. \"Last year, employment in services, which account for 86 percent of the American work force, jumped by more than 2.3 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Manufacturing, which accounts for a mere 9 percent of employment these days, experienced an increase of just 13,000 jobs. \"Given the recent numbers for hiring, said Michael Gapen of Barclays, the job market appears to be fundamentally sound. For those seeking to discern the future direction of the economy, he added, \u201clabor markets have sent the better signal.\u201d \"And according to those in a position to know, like Tom Gimbel, a Chicago recruiter, demand for new workers remains brisk.\u201cI\u2019ve got more open job orders than I\u2019ve had in a long, long time,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said. His staffing company, LaSalle Network, places workers ranging from operators in call centers who hold just a high school diploma to specialists like accountants and engineers with salaries in the six figures. Small to medium companies, in particular, are providing the growth. \u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two cities.  With big companies being more cautious, there\u2019s an opportunity for smaller firms to hire and take market share.\u201d\n. . . \n\"Overall growth last year was dragged down by weakness in trade and the factory sector, reflecting the sting of the strong dollar on exporters and softness in key markets like Europe and China . . . . \"The plunge in oil prices, meanwhile, has meant a reduction in drilling activity and capital expenditures by energy companies . . . . further crimping output as measured by G.D.P.  . . . \n. . . \n\u201cPeople commonly use employment as a leading indicator,\u201d said David A. Levy, a veteran independent economist in Mount Kisco, N.Y., \u201cbut it\u2019s a lagging indicator.\u201d  Mr. Levy said the optimists were underestimating just how big the impact from weakness overseas will be.\n\u201cThe U.S. economy is going to be pulled into a recession for the first time since World War II by overseas events,\u201d he said. \u201cEmerging markets, including China, are this cycle\u2019s housing bubble.\u201d\n. . . \n\"The surge in hiring late last year could be a sign that the American economy has better days ahead. But no one says it\u2019s a sure thing.  . . .  Despite a few prominent pockets of weakness, like manufacturing or energy industry investment, demand for the services that consumers want remains healthy, and that ultimately is what now drives the American economy, said Drew T. Matus, an economist at UBS Securities. \u201cExports look worse and demand for goods is volatile but services are holding up,\u201d Mr. Matus said.

Even so, I see this as unhelpful complexity with little/no data to establish proven predictive value. I think the same thing of other, additional considerations I have seen used.

Looking at the issue another way, I thought that past performance of the job creation market is unlikely to have a strong influence on a current month's job creation beyond a certain period.  On gut instinct, I picked 6 months as that likely period. Exporting the 1939-2015 data to a spreadsheet, I deleted Feb-Jun for each year and shifted the January column to follow the previous year's Jul-Dec.   It seems to me that what's characteristic of Jan 2016 is that it is following a period of sustained, uninterrupted (albeit variable) growth in job creation.  For that reason, I deleted all years (rows) in which there had been even a single month of negative job growth in the 6 mos. preceding January.  This left years '42, '51, '55, '61, '65-'68, '71, '73, '75-'79, '84-'89, '92-'96, '98, '99, '04-'06, and '11-'14.  I call these \"sustained growth years\" below. A sensible \"baseline\" for each January seemed (again, gut instinct) to be the three months preceding January, so for each of these years, I averaged job figures for Oct-Dec.  I then compared each Jan job figure with the average of the preceding Oct-Dec to calculate the fraction/multiple of the \"baseline\" the Jan job figure represented. I then calculated the Oct-Dec 2015 \"baseline\" (= avg. 283,400 jobs/mo.) To get a sense for what Jan performance for each of the sustained growth years would have looked like for each of the sustained growth years identified above, I multiplied the Oct-Dec 2015 baseline figure by the Jan fraction/multiple figure for each sustained growth year.  This yielded a set of 35 corresponding values, which I separated into the <175K, 175K-225K, and >225K categories recited in the question.  Final tally: <175K, 15 of 35 values = 42.9% \n175K-225K, 2 of 35 values = 5.7%\n>225K, 18 of 35 values = 51.4% To do:  Look at these sustained growth years some more to see if I can figure out any reason why Jan #s were up or down relative to preceding Oct-Dec and try to correlate with the same reason as of Oct-Dec 2015.
