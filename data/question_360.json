The parliament is dominated by the majority party (501 of 547 seats) and an extension approval requires only 2/3 majority (365/547).  Furthermore, the easement of some of the more extreme restrictions brought about by the state of emergency makes the situation more tenable into the future. In short, the federal government has little incentive to remove the state of emergency, as it grants them extra powers to limit the ethnic federalist system and essentially remove the secession option by threat/use of force.\nYes, but only in some areas:\nThis condition would require state governments to independently declare states of emergency.  Within the Ethiopian ethnic federalist system, these state governments are ethnically dominated and, in the case of Oromia, the government is dominated by the ethnic group which is staging the greatest opposition to the federal government.  There is little incentive for the Oromian government to do this, as the opposition is a powerful tool in maintaining the ethnic balance of power at the federal level.\nNo:\nTo satisfy this condition, the Ethiopian Parliament would have to vote to remove the state of emergency within the month.  This is unlikely because the federal government has no incentive to do this and is receiving very little international pressure (reduced after the initial rounds of arrests in OCT16) to do so.  The most likely source of this outcome would be international pressure mounting from a future event that is a significant violation of human rights.\nSources:\nhttp://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/Ethiopian_Constitution.html\nhttp://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/ethiopia-extends-state-emergency-months-170330110807086.html\nhttp://www.africanews.com/2017/03/15/ethiopia-relaxes-state-of-emergency-restrictions//\nhttps://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/916611/download"], [29695, "2017-04-11T13:13:55Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [32874, "2017-04-11T02:26:11Z", [0.89, 0.09, 0.02], ""], [32775, "2017-04-11T01:06:37Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.05], ""], [34877, "2017-04-10T16:27:50Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [14777, "2017-04-10T03:36:53Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [1993, "2017-04-09T14:05:54Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-09T11:34:48Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-08T11:35:28Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-04-07T20:53:56Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [33280, "2017-04-07T11:00:03Z", [0.85, 0.15, 0.0], ""], [29680, "2017-04-06T20:30:56Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "I missed an extension apparently.

Protesters demanded social and political reforms including an end to human rights abuses (including government killings of civilians, mass arrests, government land seizures, and political marginalization of opposition groups). The government responded by restricting access to the Internet and attacking as well as arresting protesters.\nIn the three days leading up to 8 August, Reuters reported that at least 90 protesters had been shot and killed by Ethiopian security forces, marking the most violent crackdown against protesters in sub-Saharan Africa since at least 75 people were killed during protests in Ethiopia's Oromia Region in November and December 2015.\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, at least 500 people are estimated to have been killed as of October 2016.\nThe Ethiopian government denied violence being committed by the country's security forces, naming regional rivals Eritrea and Egypt as the origins for the ongoing unrest.\n_________________________\nCOMMENTS:  According to the U.S. Department of State's human rights report for 2004, the Ethiopian government's human rights \"remained poor; although there were improvements, serious problems remained.\" The report listed numerous cases where police and security forces are said to have harassed, illegally detained, tortured, and/or killed individuals, who were members of opposition groups or accused of being insurgents. Thousands of suspects remained in detention without charge, and lengthy pretrial detention continued to be a problem. Prison conditions were poor. The government often ignores citizens' privacy rights and laws regarding search warrants. Although fewer journalists have been arrested, detained, or punished in 2004 than in previous years, the government nevertheless continues to restrict freedom of the press. The government limits freedom of assembly, particularly for members of opposition groups, and security forces have used excessive force to break up demonstrations. Violence and discrimination against women continue to be problems. Female genital mutilation is widespread, although efforts to curb the practice have had some effect. The economic and sexual exploitation of children continues, as does human trafficking. Forced labor, particularly among children, is a persistent problem. Low-level government interference with labor unions continues.
