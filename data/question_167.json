That said, and for those who might are inclined to be concerned with quarterly sales, production at Tesla seems to be now underway at a very high clip and Tesla is still sitting on a virtual mountain of produced/in production customer ordered cars, that are just about to find a home in December.

Average of each quarterly y-o-y rate back to Q1 14 is 53% with 24% standard deviation. This implies slightly better than 50% chance. Another way of thinking about this - looking at Q-o-Q growth rates, historically Q2 and Q4 have shown strong growth while Q1 and Q3 have been broadly flat q-o-q. If i average the Q2 and Q3 2016 numbers (assume Q2 was depressed due to backlog and this came through in Q3, bumping it up) this would imply c. 19,400 in each of Q2 and Q3 ... and hence the Q4 required figure of a bit over 26,000 would imply a required 35% q-o-q growth on Q3. The average Q4 q-o-q growth rate has been 34% with 15% stdev. This implies a very slightly less than 50% chance.  Taking the above two statistical approaches together I therefore get to a 50% chance (one slightly more likely, one slightly less).  Finally, the Q3 2016 release stated \"We expect Q4 deliveries and production to be at or slightly above Q3\". The required 26,310 is 7% above the reported Q3 figure - to me this is more than \"slightly above\", that is a decent beat.

At any rate, whatever the reason(s) this is more likely to hurt sales rather than help them. Additionally, Tesla has just dropped the entry-level model X as an option for purchase. Once again, why?

This is more than delivered in any quarter before, but the trend from 2014 and 2015 is Q4 being the biggest quarter of the year by roughly 20%. Thus, it seems safe to predict that Q4 2016 will see more than 24,500 deliveries, or even more than 24,500 + 20% = 29,400. People have noted that the Q3 number includes 5,150 deliveries from the end of Q2, meaning only 19,350 were \"true\" Q3 deliveries. Sure, but there are 5,500 in transit now, so we'd only need 26,278 - 5,500 = 20,778 \"true\" Q4 deliveries. That's a very small increase from \"true\" Q3 deliveries. According to a source I can't find right now, rate of production increased throughout Q3 reached just shy of 2000 at the very end. At 2000 cars / week they would produce a further 26,000 cars in Q4. I don't have any concrete ideas about how they could fail. In very abstract terms, if they used some expendable resource to achieve this remarkable Q3 result, they could be out of this resource for Q4. I don't know what that resource would be. Or, there could be yet another supply chain mishap like has happened in the past. Overall I feel like the chances of 80k cars in 2016 are at least better than even, possibly quite a lot better. But Tesla doesn't release monthly sales so this might well be the last chance to update the forecast based on solid info, so I will play it safe and call it 60%.

Tesla\u2019s first model, the two-seat Roadster, which was produced from 2008 to 2011, also had its problems. . . .

Tesla's initial estimate was 80-90k so they must have felt they would get extra capacity in H2 (why not announce it if it was going to be earlier). To reach 90k it would mean an extra 87pw, so lets round it up to 100pw. This assumes they would have never made an estimate that they knew they couldn't reach under any circumstances (note I am using deliveries as a proxy for production here). Therefore assuming no production issues at all we get the following: Q1 14,820 (using deliveries as a proxy for production)\nQ2 22,750\nQ3 24,050\nQ4 24,050 For a total of 85,670 as a maximum.  However, that assumes production increases come as early as possible. If we were to move them by a month into their respective quarters we would get 84,270, ie still a lot of room. Lets take 85k as a best case. If we do worst case scenario (still assuming no production issues) ie 250pw increase only comes at end of q2 and no q3 or q4 increase we get 79,820. So lets take 80k as a worst case. So my initial estimate is Tesla could produce 80-85k, however I think they could do better in terms of deliveries as if you take Q4 15 delivery numbers for Model S they were 17,192, or about 300pw above production, and according to their press release (http://ir.teslamotors.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=963460) there was production that was not delivered (and here again I am making an assumption that they mentioned this because it was more material than normal). If we give them  just over a week of equivalent production in terms of deliveries (2000), which should be conservative, it results in a potential delivery range of 82-87k, again assuming no further production issues. The production issues were clearly material enough that Tesla felt the need to put out a special explanation (they were 1,180 below guidance). If we repeat that same miss for 2 out of the 3 remaining quarters (but reduce the shortfall by 1000 given the conservative nature of scenario), we would get an overall range of 80-85k. So the ability to supply more that 80k looks safe, turning to the demand side, we have the following information: From Tesla: \"New Model S orders grew over 35% year on year in Q4 [2015], with growth in all regions\" From Teslamotorclub.com 23apr16 (a site where \"fans\" log their orders for Teslas, with all the bias that comes with that): \"About 50 more Model S are being ordered per day, every day, than the previous quarter and at a current historical high rate.\" I am not sure how much weight to place on this, but amongst fans it is clear that the Model 3 announcement has not cannabalised the demand for Model S - which was the concern. From above press release \"Q1 orders exceeded Q1 deliveries by a wide margin, with Q1 Model S orders being 45% higher than Q1 last year\" Unfortunately, it is harder to get information on Model X orders beyond hype/hearsay, but extrapolating from the fact that delivery times are longer for the Model X I will assume that demand is comparable to that of Model S, the latter was always more at risk from Model 3. Q2 deliveries should indicate whether that assumption is valid. Taking all of the above it seems that both in terms of supply and demand there is say an 84% chance of Tesla beating 80,000 deliveries (100% - 10% for random unexpected event, and -6% as analysis depends mainly on Tesla, rather than independent, releases).

The reason is that they used a range for the their prediction once before, in August 2015, when they revised their prior estimate of 55k to 50k-55k (http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/05/tesla-teeters-after-lowering-guidance/).

Using a range makes marketing sense, as they can say at the end of the year that they reached their target by breaking 80k, but still claim to expect to sell up to 90k, a more impressive number. Thus, using an estimate of 80k, average actual delivery of -1.89%, SD of 12.03%, and a (strong) assumption of normalcy, the probability of breaking 80k is 44%. Their Q1 update saw them hit 14.8k deliveries, missing their Q1 target of 16k, but still sticking with their 80k-90k prediction. I don't think it changes much, so I'll stick with my 44%."], [14933, "2016-04-24T00:24:25Z", [0.7], ""], [24264, "2016-04-23T22:43:19Z", [0.15], "Tesla is discovering that there's no such thing as a car that's a computer on wheels.

This year it expects to deliver 80k - 90k so initially I'd expect them to be over the low end as well. I think the number of Model 3 orders surprised everyone, including Tesla, so my guess is they find themselves with more cash on hand than expected --- $1000 for each of 400k orders, that's $400M, pretty substantial. Another thing that springs to mind: Tesla made its 2015 sales prediction in 2014. In 2015, gas prices fell and stayed substantially below 2014 levels [2]. One might think this would drive down demand for electric cars, but they still met their predicted sales. As is well-known, the price of oil is on the rise again [3], so one might expect gas prices to help this year, rather than hinder like last year. In other words, the prediction seems very realistic to me. How could Tesla fail to meet its delivery target? Fewer people might buy than expected; there might some logistical problem; some occurrence (accident?) in the factories that delays production; some problem with the current cars that diverts effort towards fixing it; some lawsuit? I don't know. If I assign 10% chance to the few-buyers option, and 5% probabilities to each of these other obstacles, I come away with a 30% chance of failure. So let's call it a 70%.

Assuming those will be rolled out at constant rate over course of 2016 let's call it they will have an average of 261 stores over course of year.  Thus, in order to achieve 60% vehicle sales growth rate, they would have to increase sales per store 35% derived as follows:\n221*x=50,000 -> x=226 sales/store/yr\n261*(x+y)=80,000 -> y=80.5 increase in sales/store/yr\n80.5/226 = 35% increase in sales per store An interesting analysis would be to count number of retail locations & sales in prior years to determine growth rate of sales per store.  Is 35% for 2016 realistic? Given the shear number of people making deposits for the model 3, the obvious question is to what extent will these reservations cannibalize 2016 sales.  I think that is a hard question to answer although it will definitely be >0 so the 35% increase in sales per store would have to overcome that, making that harder to achieve. On that note, Musk indicated on Twitter the following on week after RSVP's became available:\n\"Thought it would slow way down today,\" Musk said on Twitter on Friday morning. \"Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.\"\n\"Definitely going to need to rethink production planning,\" he said in a follow-up Tweet.\nhttp://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/02/putting-tesla-motors-incs-232000-model-3-reservati.aspx Based on these statements I would speculate that the number of people opting for future model 3's vs current S/X machines will be higher than Tesla expected, pushing me towards an expectation of missing their forecast for 2016 sales. As for how to quantify this,  It appears the crowd consensus of 55% recovered from 50% soon after model reservation numbers became public.  I am going to wager that crowd is not taking this cannibalization effect adequately into account, as I am not seeing it mentioned much in top comments, so will taper down from crowd's 55% to 40%."], [823, "2016-04-20T19:30:39Z", [0.5], ""], [4694, "2016-04-20T15:44:18Z", [0.5], ""], [142, "2016-04-20T13:01:10Z", [0.8], "Passage of time.
