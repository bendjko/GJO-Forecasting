Texas' shift from Lean Republican to Toss Up shouldn't come as a surprise. Recent polling in the state \u2014 both public and private - shows a 2-4 point race. That's pretty much in line with the hotly contested 2018 Senate race in the state where Sen. Ted Cruz narrowly defeated Rep. Beto O'Rourke 51 percent to 48 percent.  A huge surge in early vote (as of October 26th, almost half of Texas' registered voters had already cast a ballot) suggests that we could see record turnout in a state that has added many new residents since 2016. That also adds a level of uncertainty to the equation.  Statewide and district level polling show Biden running strong in and around metro suburban parts of the state, but underperforming with Latino voters. In his analysis of the New York Times/Siena poll (10/20-25) of the state, the New York Times' Nate Cohn writes that \"Biden has a lead of only 57 percent to 34 percent among that group, somewhat beneath most estimates of Mrs. Clinton's support among Hispanic voters four years ago. The finding broadly tracks with national surveys, which have shown Mr. Trump improving among Hispanic voters compared with his 2016 standing. Similarly, Hispanic voters in the Times/Siena poll say they backed Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 60 percent to 29 percent.\" But, it's also the case that we don't have a whole lot of experience with Texas as a battleground state. Neither do national pollsters. In an analysis of polling errors in 2016 and 2018, my colleague David Wasserman wrote this week that polls in the Southwest \"undershot Democrats' final margin in 17 of 19 cases, including by an average of 1.4 points in 2016 and 4.2 points in 2018.\" https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/bidens-path-270-widens-trumps-path-narrows-texas-moves-toss"], [94872, "2020-10-29T21:36:07Z", [0.34, 0.66, 0.0], ""], [43311, "2020-10-29T20:14:02Z", [0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "\"But the polls!

This could be an indicator that Trump already struggled to convince Texans in 2016, despite it being the quintessential red state.  Not to sound overblown, but Trump's antics become more and more ridiculous by the day. If anything could make Texas swing, it'd be him. Nonetheless, the polls for the most part still have Trump winning in Texas, and the historical precedent still matters. I think it will be a closer result than usual in Texas, but I'd still expect Trump to win. A third party presidential candidate has not won in any state since 1968, so although it is in theory possible, that outcome would be one of the biggest upsets ever.

Even after Nixon resigned, who Trump is often compared to, by opponents and critics, Texas voted for Carter.\n- Then I want to adjust my sentiment, by using the \"silent majority\" argument. Yes, there are many non-vocal Republicans in Texas as well as other states. The Democrats are on a roll these months, driven by covid and BLM movement. But, when it comes to voting day, in Texas that is a typical Republican stronghold, I believe there will be a re-concentration of Republicans on the ballot, that is not showing up on polls now (something like \"silent majority\" argument that you hear sometimes. I buy that. Republicans that would be less vocal than Democrats, it somehow makes sense to me).
