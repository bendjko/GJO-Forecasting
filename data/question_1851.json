His approval rating is also at the highest as it has been at anytime in his tenure in office, due to economic measures he has undertaken while in office and it has grown amongst the poorest members of the country [2]. Bolsonaro's party did lose seats in the 2020 elections, but he has the support of a moderate block in Brazil's congress, which makes it seem unlikely that he will be removed from office before the 2022 elections [3].

Out of 8 presidents in the \"New Republic\" period of Brazil (since 1985), two (Fernando Collor de Mello, Dilma Rousseff) have been forced from office before the end of their term. We may naively estimate that being forced from office is a kind of Poisson process with an arrival rate of once per 17.5 years, in which case the probability that there will be no instance of it occuring in the next 10 months is exp(-lambda) = exp(-(10 months)/(17.5 years)) = %95.3. This gives a %4.7 probability that Bolsonaro will be forced from office before 1st October 2021. Adding these gives a base rate of %7.2 to Bolsonaro's presidency ending before 1st October 2021.
