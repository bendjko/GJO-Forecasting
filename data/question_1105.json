Some thoughts: - Germany realises Mr Weidmann is not best for the next Euro crisis when it comes, and it will come.\n- The (seem to be) best positioned candidates for the European Commission top job are French related, unless Mrs Merkel acts about it. Another good question for GJO.\n- There are new names in the pot, Klaus Regling [4] and Klaas Knot [5]. It also seems that the later has changed positions in terms of ECB measures [6]. I still bet on the compromise, but adding some %s to Germany and Someone else.

The challenge here appears to be that the power in the elections has moved to a broader base form the EPP and the social democrats that had the majority before 2019. What does this mean to the ECB president nomination? It means the big picture with the right balances to country (north/ south), party, gender (and suitability??) have to harmonise with the power scale. Other lesser pieces to the negotiations are the program of the commission, where parts of the program are influenced, and parts of the whole negotiation process. Noteworthy is that the main list of ECB president candidates does not include any women, but some names are in the mix (Claudia Buch, Lagarde). Hence I began to think Margrethe Vestager, therefore, has very good cards heading the commission going into next week. Barnier? FWIW - All prospects are still in the race.

The main point is that the commission presidency or the ECB chair occupied by Germany could unnecessarily strain the relations towards the south European countries and EU budget process issues, mainly Italy. So a compromise from the Hansa-pact Northern countries would be a given, and Liikanen is the number one horse in that scenario.

Now 50, he\u2019s taken a hard line against loose monetary policy, earning him respect at home but criticism from Draghi for his perceived \u201cnein zu allem\u201d\u2014no to everything\u2014attitude. ***\n4.  Olli Rehn, Finnish Eurocrat. Rehn, 56, may be one of the newer faces in European central banking, but he\u2019s been involved in economic affairs for years. As EU commissioner in charge of the euro during the region\u2019s debt crisis, he was a strong advocate of \ufb01scal discipline before returning to Finnish politics in 2015 as economy minister and overseeing the country\u2019s emergence from a three-year recession. ***\n5.  Benoit Coeure, Markets Maestro. Coeure, 49, is already on the ECB's Executive Board with a non-renewable eight-year term that runs until the end of 2019. He's highly respected though, and it's possible a way could be found to shift him to the presidency. He's one of the architects behind quantitative easing and is responsible for markets, so he certainly has the necessary experience. \n6.  Klaas Knot, Dutch Hope. The 51-year-old head of the Dutch central bank is one of the youngest members on the Governing Council. He\u2019s also typically on the same page as Weidmann on the topic of monetary stimulus, speaking out against keeping asset purchases going for too long. \n7.  Klaus Regling. The Underwriter. One of the architects of the euro, Regling spent a decade at the German Finance Ministry where he helped prepare for economic and monetary union. In his current position leading the European Stability Mechanism, a backstop for countries in financial crisis, the 68-year-old has had close insight into the euro area\u2019s existential woes. \n8.  Christine Lagarde. Trailblazing Globetrotter. Lagarde made her name breaking tradition in a world of predominantly male economic policy makers. As French finance minister from 2007-2011, she was the first woman to hold such a post in a Group of 8 country, and since then has been the first female head of the International Monetary Fund. Lagarde would also be the first woman to head the ECB and the first president without an economics degree. \n________________________\nCOMMENTS: I heard that Ireland is out. Jens Weidmann to me seems still a very strong candidate that has been on the waiting list for quite sometimes. Besides Germany may want to have that post finally.\nC. Lagarde may be on the lookout for another big assignment. But she can even have a third run at the IMF, after all the IMF by reappointing her would avoid the headache of the \"... the head of the IMF must not be from EU ..., etc.\" So I would rule her out mostly. Besides there was Trichet before.   That said, i'll bet more on Finland and Germany.\n"], [59882, "2019-02-03T18:09:05Z", [0.35, 0.4, 0.17, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0], "Philip Lane (IRL) apparently out of the running."], [43207, "2019-02-03T17:22:26Z", [0.47, 0.37, 0.16, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "With only 2 data points to use, the previous ECB Presidents were appointed around June/July of the year the outgoing President's term expired, so giving no appointment 0%.
