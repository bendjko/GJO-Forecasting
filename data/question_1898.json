Between the regular season and the playoffs this totaled 16 categories. In total, the Chiefs were better in 10 out of 16 categories. They were better in 4 out of 8 in the regular season, and 6 out of 8 in the playoffs. This means the Chiefs were better in 63% of the total categories, and 75% of the current playoff categories. I then looked at 6 categories between the two QB\u2019s, Mahomes and Brady, both regular season and playoffs: win %, completion %, touchdown %, interception %, yards/game, and quarterback rating. Shockingly, Mahomes came out on top in every category, both regular season and playoffs, making him a perfect 12 for 12 against Brady head-to-head, at least from an individual standpoint. Combining the team and individual statistics gives us a total of 28 categories, with the Chiefs and Mahomes being better in 22 out of 28 categories: a percentage of 79%. An interesting statistic is that Wild Card teams are 6-4 in the Super Bowl; the Buccaneers are looking to make it 7-4. However, only 2 of those 6 teams have come from the NFC, where the Buccaneers play. No QB has been to, or won more, Super Bowls than Tom Brady, and this is his 5th trip to the Super Bowl in the last 7 years. However, Mahomes and the Chiefs are in their 2nd straight Super Bowl, and are the defending champs looking to legitimize their dynasty. With Mahomes and the Chiefs being better than Brady and the Buccaneers in 79% of the chosen categories, I predict them to win the Super Bowl. Looking solely at these statistics I would give the Chiefs at least a 75% chance of winning the Super Bowl.

They face the Cleveland Browns, who played the game of their lives against the Steelers to win. Buffalo appears to be their biggest threat, but faces an extremely challenging Baltimore team this weekend in the Divisional round. Going purely by the oddsmakers, the AFC Championship is expected to be Kansas City versus Buffalo (with KC winning handily and Buffalo winning by a narrow margin).\nIn the NFC, there are a couple teams that are below Kansas City in terms of strength, but are solid nonetheless. Green Bay hosts the NFL's #1 defense in LA Rams this weekend, but the oddsmakers put the Packers as a touchdown favorite. The New Orleans Saints face Tampa Bay in the third showdown between Drew Brees and Tom Brady this season. Previously, the Saints won both matchups during the season and the oddsmakers also have them advancing in this game as well to make the NFC Championship Green Bay vs. New Orleans.\nLooking at the professional odds to win the Super Bowl outright (courtesy of DraftKings), the favorite is currently Kansas City at +200 followed by Green Bay at +375. New Orleans is +600 with Buffalo at +650 and the remaining teams follow (Ravens +750, Bucs +900, Rams +2000, Browns +3000).
