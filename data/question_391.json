The largest euro zone economy has accustomed the world to running budget surpluses \u2014 when income or receipts overcome expenditures \u2014 or even small deficits compared to the rest of the region. Data released in January showed that Germany's public sector hit a record surplus of 3.4 billion euros ($4.24 billion) in 2017, indicating that the government has room to step up spending. However, analysts are concerned that increasing spending, which the new government aims to do by 48 billion euros, could be detrimental in the eventuality of economic shocks. \"As long as the German economy continues to grow at such strong rates and I expect this to continue for two to three years, I do not expect a deficit,\" Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said Wednesday. \"However, if something happens, and growth slows down, then we are quickly back in deficit territory as a new government will spend all the extra tax revenues for consumption.\" The last time Germany ran up a deficit, defined as the amount by which expenses or costs exceed income or revenues, was in 2013 by 0.1 percent of gross domestic product. According to Commerzbank, the coalition deal between Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Socialist Democrats (SDP) will prove \"costly.\" With a more relaxed approach to spending, should an economic shock occur, which could include a market sell-off and changes in monetary policy, Germany could be in trouble, the bank said (para 1-6).

For that the Bundespraesident must nominate someone [1], if then at least 50% of the members of Bundestag vote for this person he/she must be named chancellor by the president (that happens automatically, but is formally a separate step).\nNow more interesting is when there is no absolute majority (50+% of all possible votes for one person), then there has to be a second vote within ?14 days? (unlike for the first vote that only depended on the President nominating someone). This vote is equivalent to the first one (i.e. absolute majority and automatic naming to chancellor). If that also fails there has to be a third one (I'm unsure about the timing here, but it is rather quickly), which is different:\nIn the third vote (actually a write-in vote) anyone with the most votes is nominated (i.e. only plurality is needed anymore), BUT the president has the choice of naming him/her chancellor OR calling for new elections. This is the only way to get to new elections without naming a chancellor first! The other way of triggering new elections would go like: Elect a chancellor (who must be proposed by the president for the first two votes), have that chancellor ask the \"Vertrauensfrage\" (\"Do you trust me?\"-question) and loose that on purpose. Now the president CAN call for new elections. [2] So unless Steinmeier plays ball there won't be new elections at all (until September 2021). He needs to desolve the Bundestag and order new elections, nobody can force him to do anything (except that he needs/wants to get reelected in a couple of years, there is no way of pressuring him) and he already said: I don't want new elections, deal with the situation (I.e. grow up). Now for this question it is relevant whether Merkel would count as elected when \n1) She gets a majority in votes 1 or 2, but immediately looses a Vertrauensfrage. I'd say yes, she had to be chancellor to ask that question.\n2a) She is elected in the 3rd vote, and Steinmeier does name her (likely). I'd say yes.\n2b) She is elected in the 3rd vote, but Steinmeier doesn't name her (unlikely) and calls for new elections. I'd say no\n3) Someone else is elected in the 3rd vote (rather unlikely). I'd say no independently of Steinmeier's choice\n4) Someone else is elected in the 1st or 2nd vote (highly unlikely). I'd say no There is, imo, no absolut majority without the CDU (Merkel's party). This would require cooperation between FDP or AFD and Lefts or Greens, which is next to impossible except on smallish issues. None of these cooperations would be something anyone wants to form a government on.\nIf the CDU needs to be part of the government, they'll also want to lead it, which makes the other way of not getting Merkel a revolt in her party. The chances here aren't actually that bad, but since the likely candidate (Jens Spahn) is significantly to Merkel's right (making forming a coalition w/o AFD impossible) there is no way for him to be chancellor of a stable government (i.e. getting elected in votes 1 or 2). If the situation stretches out for a few additional month I can see him (or someone like him) taking the chances, i.e. getting elected in vote 3, hoping that Steinmeier names him and leading a minority government. But that is an awful risky move for someone that young (and with Merkel necessarily retiring in the next 4 years).

Four months after Germany\u2019s center-left Social Democratic Party scored their worst postwar result in a general election, 600 of the party\u2019s delegates will meet to decide whether to forge a ruling alliance with Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and usher in the German chancellor\u2019s fourth term in office.

Assuming that most of the new phones sold would be the new ones, i.e. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Pluses, I used serial numbers off eBay in the UK (from product photos) to work out how many phones there were approximately in the country. I then found the worldwide number of 6Ss, using the market share of Apple in the UK relative to the world and the smartphone market size of the UK, relative to the world. Then, I used the released sales figures for Q4 2015 to account for those that were sold in that quarter. Finally, I used a linear projection to work out, based upon the number of phones sold so far in this quarter, the total for Q1 2016, which I project to be 82.4 million phones. This of course ignores Christmas, which I might have to revisit in the future. Another, less interesting way (in my opinion i.e. no less valid), is to look at what happens to sales in the quarter after Apple releases a new phone internationally (i.e. from the iPhone 3GS onwards). In more recent years this has always neatly been at the end of the 4th quarter (i.e. the one before December), but in previous years this has been more towards the beginning of a quarter. Looking at the geometric mean of the factor difference between the quarter where most of the new sales occurs and previous one, there is projected to be 82.9 million phones sold in Q1 2016. Both methods are pretty conclusively above 75 million, although the standard deviation on the Bayesian method is considerable - I need to crunch the stats properly to quantify it, but it looks to be roughly a 10% chance it'll be below 75M.

Replacing Merkel as the leader of the CDU would be one way, but replacing a centrists CDU leader with a more right wing CDU leader would seem unlikely to make it easier to form a coalition. A new General Election with the CDU having more right wing leader might increase the CDU/CSU vote share, but it would seem unlikely it would give the CDU/CSU a majority without forming a coalition, and forming a coalition would probably be more, not less difficult than it is now.

Frankly, I was shocked by it. I never imagined that such serious, concerning reasons lay behind an adjustment of just 2%!   But both his reasoning and adjustment make sense as he explains them. To me, the most shocking statements he made were: \n1) \"Angela Merkel has done some very bad moves\". I guess I've been guilty of thinking that she walked on water. Yes, he is correct that this is partly wishful thinking, as I see the need for strong & stable German leadership critical at this point in the EU, NATO, and in the Western world, given the leadership vacuum created by the retreat of the US into an isolationist \"America First\" policy, and the chaos engendered by Brexit, to say nothing of the aggressiveness of Putin! However, it seems unfair to lay all the blame for the failure of coalition negotiations at her feet; it seems that most lay a larger heap of the blame for the failure of these negotiation at the feet of the FDP--or have perceptions changed? 2) Secondly, I was shocked to read: \"she is losing ground within her party every day\". I was totally unaware of this. In fact, somehow I had gotten the opposite impression: that she was gaining strength. A Google search for information about her polling turned up some shocking polling data from 12/28/17 (over the Christmas holidays while I was traveling) that supports his statement.  \"A new YouGov poll released on Wednesday found that 47 percent of Germans would prefer the chancellor not to complete a fourth term in office, while only 36 percent said they would like to see her go another round.\" (http://www.dw.com/en/the-beginning-of-the-end-for-german-chancellor-angela-merkel/a-41961335) I cannot defend my forecast of 100%. I agree with him that it contains an element of wishful thinking. It is hard for me to let go sometimes when I've become committed to a person/idea. In my desire to not be overly reactive and a \"fair weather friend\", I sometimes am too loyal. In my opinion, the loss of the leadership of Angela Merkel would be the third very serious blow to the West, after Brexit and the election of DRT. I am shocked and deeply saddened to realize that it is so much more possible than I realized. Painful truths must be faced--sooner or later.

Angela Merkel does not need 355 members, or 50% plus one.  She only requires the loyalty of 239 in the Bundestag to form a government. That is 33.7% of the Bundestag. Much less than 50% will form a \u201cmajority\u201d government. 2. How powerful are 239 Germans? The majority government would only represent 25% of the German population; and the power and leanings of these 25% would govern the remainder of Berlin, the other 15 states, much of Brussels as well as the rest of Western Europe\u2014including London, Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, because they remain in the EEC (European Economic Community). Moreover, Japanese companies and others have to pick a legislative regime, either California's (@lsgold7) or Brussels'. 3. Here is how it works, in simple terms:  For any German party, Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz only need half of their own members. They form a dominant bloc that holds the cards to control the other half of their party.  For a comfortable dominance in conservative parties, Angela Merkel might want to have two-thirds on her payroll, who in turn control offices and budgets of the remaining third. The dependency keeps them either weak, or loyal. 4. In numbers, party (share within the parliamentary group): \u2014 CDU 132 members (66%) \n\u2014 CSU 30 members (66%)\n\u2014 SPD 77 members (50% + 1)\n======\nMinimal coalition: 239 members (approx. 33.7% of the Bundestag) 5. Number of the remainder, who needs to be controlled: 116.  116 + 239 = 355\n709 seats \u00d7 50% = 354.5 6. Bolstered by controlling the other (un-) constitutional organs, the presidency, courts and central bank(s); the absolute power of a minority is assured. 7. The opposition of 354 seats don't matter at all; while 116 inside the government coalition might disagree, they will receive enough attention to be kept in control. 8. While roughly two-third of the Bundestag might object Angela Merkel as chancellor, she only have to take care of 116 of them. 9. \u201cJamaika\u201d would have required 236, as a minimal coalition, or three less.

SPD leader Martin Schulz told a news conference the party leadership had reached the decision out of a sense of responsibility to Germany and Europe after Merkel\u2019s attempt to form a government with two smaller parties collapsed on Sunday. \u201cThere is nothing automatic about the direction we are moving in,\u201d Schulz said. \u201cIf a discussion results in us deciding to participate, in any form whatsoever, in the formation of a government, we will put it to a vote of party members.\u201d Backing for a new government could come in various forms, including a coalition, a formal agreement not to obstruct a Merkel-led minority government, or an informal agreement to tolerate it (para.1-5).

So if the political parties agree to  go this route, it is possible that Merkel is technically elected as a Chancellor yet there are new elections. The GJO should clarify how would they score the question in this case as well. My 20% for a \"no\" are mostly for the case where Merkel does not receive even a relative majority - i.e., even in the third vote a majority of Bundestag MPs vote against her. Hard to judge how likely is that - on the one hand, in an arranged solution most opposing MPs may simply abstain; on the other hand, they may want to make sure that a minority government is firmly off the table.

However, I think there will be a coalition eventually, with Merkel as Chancellor. \"Green concessions raise hopes of German coalition breakthrough - Climate and energy prove sticking points in progress to form a new government\nYESTERDAY Guy Chazan in Berlin \nGermany\u2019s Greens say they will compromise on some of their big demands such as an end date for petrol and diesel cars in an important concession that could break the logjam in talks to form a new coalition government. The talks follow September\u2019s inconclusive elections when the two main parties \u2014 Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the Social Democrats \u2014 slumped to their worst result since 1949. Ever since, Ms Merkel has been trying to cobble together an unwieldy coalition with the Greens and the liberal FDP, two parties with vastly divergent views on everything from climate policy to tax reform and the future of Europe. Progress in the exploratory talks has been so slow that some in the FDP have even suggested Germany might have to hold new elections \u2014 a prospect most parties view with horror. The big sticking points are immigration, climate and energy, with the Greens insisting that the coalition partners commit to banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and shutting down Germany\u2019s 20 most polluting coal-fired power stations. The FDP and CSU, the Bavarian sister party of Ms Merkel\u2019s CDU, both reject any attempt to impose a hard-and-fast date for banning sales of the combustion engine. But in an interview with the Stuttgarter Zeitung on Tuesday, Green co-chair\u00a0Cem Ozdemir said the party could compromise on a cut-off date for cars if there was a\u00a0\u201cclear commitment that we will do everything possible to have the vehicles of the future \u2014 interconnected, automated and emissions-free\u201d. This could include stronger incentives for electric vehicles as well as driver bans in inner-city areas for older, more polluting diesel cars. Other Green leaders also showed flexibility on coal.\u00a0\u201cFor us it\u2019s not a question of whether the last coal-fired power station is taken offline in 2030 or 2032 \u2014 we\u2019re pragmatic on that,\u201d party chairman Simone Peter told the Rheinische Post. \u201cFor us it\u2019s more important that CO2 emissions in 2020 are 40 per cent lower than they were in 1990 and that the sectoral targets for 2030 are adhered to.\u201d The four parties hope they will reach an agreement by mid-November that will form the basis for formal coalition negotiations. That preliminary deal will have to be approved by the Greens at their party conference on November 25. If it is rejected, the prospects for\u00a0\u201cJamaica\u201d \u2014 so-called because the partners\u2019 party colours match those of the Jamaican flag \u2014 will fade. It is unclear at this stage whether the Greens\u2019 willingness to compromise will have any discernible effect on the progress of talks. The FDP is still strongly opposed to driver bans for diesel cars and to aggressive action against Germany\u2019s coal industry.\u00a0\u201cWe weren\u2019t elected to abolish hundreds and thousands of jobs,\u201d said Wolfgang Kubicki, the FDP\u2019s deputy leader. However, FDP leader Christian Lindner has also insisted that the FDP was\u00a0\u201cby no means a coal party\u201d. It simply wanted to know from the Greens how Germany could have a stable energy supply without having to rely on\u00a0\u201cdirty electricity from Polish lignite\u201d or from French nuclear power stations, he said.\"\n"], [4273, "2017-11-07T05:23:05Z", [0.98], ""], [27480, "2017-11-06T10:38:40Z", [1.0], ""], [25141, "2017-11-06T09:23:55Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-05T05:56:54Z", [1.0], ""], [41120, "2017-11-04T14:27:51Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-11-04T09:37:01Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-04T06:09:24Z", [1.0], ""], [35657, "2017-11-03T20:04:48Z", [1.0], ""], [4, "2017-11-03T16:54:31Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-11-03T12:35:41Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-03T05:43:26Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-11-03T02:47:08Z", [1.0], ""], [29907, "2017-11-02T22:06:37Z", [0.97], ""], [691, "2017-11-02T16:25:01Z", [1.0], ""], [37520, "2017-11-02T06:46:03Z", [1.0], "Who else could it be!"], [1034, "2017-11-02T05:06:55Z", [1.0], ""], [31683, "2017-11-02T00:01:44Z", [0.99], ""], [31683, "2017-11-02T00:01:36Z", [0.93], ""], [23234, "2017-11-01T22:14:59Z", [0.99], ""], [691, "2017-11-01T15:29:02Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-11-01T05:35:48Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-31T22:22:16Z", [1.0], ""], [41052, "2017-10-31T18:14:01Z", [0.99], ""], [1034, "2017-10-31T06:16:15Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-10-30T17:08:58Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-30T04:47:39Z", [1.0], ""], [4273, "2017-10-29T23:15:39Z", [0.95], ""], [691, "2017-10-29T12:29:37Z", [1.0], ""], [4778, "2017-10-29T10:57:41Z", [0.9], ""], [1034, "2017-10-29T05:57:00Z", [1.0], ""], [37350, "2017-10-29T01:08:25Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-28T22:11:35Z", [1.0], ""], [35, "2017-10-28T18:37:11Z", [0.97], ""], [1034, "2017-10-28T05:06:11Z", [1.0], ""], [20, "2017-10-28T01:54:50Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-27T19:53:26Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-27T12:43:43Z", [1.0], ""], [32872, "2017-10-26T19:02:12Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-26T15:00:53Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-26T06:30:26Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-25T18:10:26Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-25T14:55:08Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-24T20:06:18Z", [1.0], ""], [40913, "2017-10-24T00:22:52Z", [1.0], ""], [4273, "2017-10-23T22:58:53Z", [0.98], ""], [691, "2017-10-23T02:13:33Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-22T23:32:45Z", [1.0], ""], [4778, "2017-10-22T11:16:48Z", [0.85], ""], [23234, "2017-10-22T07:03:27Z", [1.0], ""], [1034, "2017-10-21T20:20:38Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-21T18:52:06Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-10-20T12:30:50Z", [1.0], "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/jamaica-or-bust-merkel-launching-crunch-german-coalition-talks-idUSKBN1CP14A?il=0\nstill pretty good odds, this coalition being politically the most palatable and there being nobody else plausible"], [1034, "2017-10-20T05:48:07Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-10-19T22:54:54Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-10-19T17:06:22Z", [1.0], ""], [4273, "2017-10-18T23:35:21Z", [0.95], ""], [12605, "2017-10-18T21:20:46Z", [0.99], "Comment deleted on Nov 05, 2017 11:58PM UTC"], [12605, "2017-10-18T20:47:06Z", [0.99], "Negotiations are meant to go well beyond Christmas; would this conclude as a \u201cNo\u201d?"], [754, "2017-10-18T17:36:06Z", [1.0], "EXCERPTED FROM THE ECONOMIST THIS AM: (OCT 18) Four into one?

Merkel's comments, made in a speech in the Baltic Sea resort town of Zingst two months before a federal election, underline her personal determination to deepen European integration if she is re-elected for a fourth term. Calling European Union membership one of Germany's biggest strengths, Merkel said last year's Brexit decision and elections in France and the Netherlands, in which pro-European parties defeated populist candidates, had changed her perspective. \"For many people, including myself, something changed when we saw the Britons want to leave, when we were worried about the outcome of the elections in France and the Netherlands,\" Merkel told voters, some of whom wore straw hats with black-red-and-gold hatbands, the colors of the German flag. The center-right chancellor admitted that the EU was far from perfect and that Brussels sometimes was too bureaucratic. \"But we have realized in the past few months that Europe is more than just bureaucracy and economic regulation, that Europe and living together in the European Union have something to do with war and peace, that the decades of peace after World War Two would have been completely unthinkable without the European Union,\" Merkel said to applause.

The rival Social Democrats (SPD) were unchanged at 23 percent, while the pro-environment Greens gained 1 percentage point to 9 percent and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was unchanged at 7 percent, Forsa said. The far-left Linke party lost 1 point to 9 percent, and the pro-business Free Democrats dropped 1 percentage point to 7 percent, in the poll of 2,502 eligible voters that was conducted on June 19-23. It showed Merkel's Christian Democrats at their highest support level since September 2015, shortly after Merkel's decision to open the doors to more than 1 million migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Afghanistan. Forsa said 52 percent of those polled would back Merkel for a fourth term if the chancellor were elected directly, a drop of 1 percentage point, compared with an unchanged 22 percent who would back SPD leader Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament (para. 1-5).

I am not going for certainty (100%) because there is quite long time before the election and the UK result has shown that it is possible for a \"strong and stable\" leader to loose a lot of support in a badly run campaign. I agree that the populist right's support has declined in Europe and I agree that being close to Trump is not a vote winner in Europe, but its a stretch to conclude that the latter has caused the former. Evidence; Trump already existed before the UK EU referendum vote and it was known that Farage of UKIP had connections with the same people who were helping Trump. While Trump had not become US President, the US Presidential campaign was well known to people in Europe who had an interest in populism. The fact that Obama gave his view that leaving the EU was a bad idea did not help the Remain side, having Trump supporting the Leave side probably did nothing to help it, but neither did it stop Leave winning. The same applied to the Austrian elections, Trump existed at the time of both elections. True by the December election Trump had won the Presidential election, and I expect many Austrians were not Trump fans, but Trump had not yet become President so Austrians had no more knowledge of what effect he would have in December than they did in May.  \nI think it more likely that European voters have seen that when Populist movements have won elections they have not been able to deliver on the instant improvement they said would follow.  European voters do to some extent notice what happens in elections in other European countries (they are all part of the EU, so it matters), but regard what happens is the US as a side show. Abortion, lack of gun control, lack of universal health care seem to almost all Europeans really strange issues to be arguing about. \nUKIP started losing support immediately after the referendum as its supporters started switching to the party that was delivering Brexit, Trump had nothing to do with it (he had not yet been elected, so why would being friends with Trump help UKIP with the Brexit vote, but support start to drop while UKIP was still friends with Trump a few months later?) UKIP changed its leader, support slumped more, UKIP changed its leader again support slumped more, the new leader was caught out on some untruths and lost a by-election , the one MP UKIP had resigned from UKIP, UKIP slumped some more.\nWhen Mrs May called the UK General Election she was a long way ahead in the polls (in spite of holding hands with Trump). If the election had taken place two months earlier with no campaign May would have won by a landslide. I don't think Trump did anything in the 6 weeks of the campaign to make British voters decide they did not like him (they had already tried to get him banned from the country). Mrs May managed the lose the UK election without any help from the Trump effect. People did not like her and did not like her policies. No one in the UK cared if she was friends with Trump or not. In fact she was a lot closer to Trump in January (when she was polling very well) that she was in June.  Brexit has turned out to not nearly as simple as advertised, instant gratification did not follow the referendum. The whole of Europe can see what a mess the UK economy is in, it can see how badly it is going.  I think the Brexit effect has had a lot more to do with putting Europeans off populists.  \n "], [27367, "2017-06-23T15:21:21Z", [0.72], ""], [1034, "2017-06-23T05:52:34Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-22T21:04:26Z", [0.98], ""], [212, "2017-06-22T14:09:56Z", [0.93], ""], [5386, "2017-06-22T07:32:03Z", [0.95], ""], [1034, "2017-06-22T05:46:47Z", [1.0], ""], [2965, "2017-06-22T01:31:54Z", [1.0], ""], [35726, "2017-06-21T15:08:00Z", [0.93], ""], [27101, "2017-06-21T10:10:29Z", [0.9], ""], [1034, "2017-06-21T06:19:32Z", [1.0], ""], [10898, "2017-06-21T00:13:07Z", [0.9], ""], [11759, "2017-06-20T12:24:04Z", [0.9], ""], [1034, "2017-06-20T07:06:05Z", [1.0], ""], [691, "2017-06-19T14:00:18Z", [0.98], ""], [1034, "2017-06-19T07:01:36Z", [1.0], ""], [31317, "2017-06-18T21:39:51Z", [0.9], ""], [2965, "2017-06-18T15:27:00Z", [1.0], "http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/13/the-west-will-have-to-go-it-alone-without-the-united-states-trump/\nhey @tsm here is the polling elections data\nTrump is making Europe more liberal and international.\nIts not just anecdotal.\nThanks to @PTetlock for retweeting  this 538 piece\nThe lower the US Gallup number on President Trump domestic approval goes \nthe higher the German Gallup- number on Merkel's domestic approval rises \nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-making-europe-liberal-again/?ex_cid=538twitter\n\"The beneficiaries of the right-wing decline have variously been politicians on the left (such as Austria\u2019s Van der Bellen2), the center-left (such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron) and the center-right (such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, whose Christian Democratic Union has rebounded in polls).

Two such instruments are available:\n-\thttps://www.inwt-statistics.de/blog-artikel-lesen/wahlprognose-fuer-die-bundestagswahl-2017.html#Prognose (German)\n-\thttp://www.thecrosstab.com/germany-2017/ (English)\n-\tRaw data is provided here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_German_federal_election,_2017\nThe German page by INWT Statistics is also modeling the probability that Merkel can stay German Chancellor: to date this is 84,5 per cent. However there are some arguments this could be too high and some that this could be too low.\n84,5 per cent is too low:\n-\tThe poll aggregators model a red-red-green coalition (SPD-LEFT-Greens) as more likely than a Grand Coalition of CDU und SPD, if both were possible. This is a strong assumption since \u2013 first \u2013 voters do not prefer the red-red-green coalition and both, SPD and the LEFT, have a very considerable disagreement among leaders and rank-and-file to go ahead with such a coalition. If possible, I would say that the chances are \u2013 at best \u2013 50 percent for this coalition to be formed. Schultz clearly signals to voters that he does not want form a coalition with the LEFT in the first place.\n-\tGiven the fact that the SPD has to make a statement on coalition options and given the clear impression from several regional elections that red-red-green coalition is not preferred by the voters, it seems likely that this route to the Chancellorship is completely down for Martin Schulz, the candidate for Chancellorship of the SPD. The only route that he then has is a coalition with the Liberals and the Greens. But: If this kind of a \u2018traffic light coalition\u2019 would be possible and given that the CDU would have the biggest seat share (very, very likely: 99 percent) a CDU-Liberal-Green coalition would be possible, either. The Liberals and the Greens would be in the position to decide which side they would join and which of the candidates would become German Chancellor. Greens tend to the SPD camp, Liberals tend to the CDU camp. That would very likely end up in a stalemate. Consequence: Grand Coalition, Chancellor: Merkel.\n-\tGiven the enormous success of the Liberals in the regional elections in North Rhine Westphalia (12+ percent), it could become more likely than pollsters currently measure that a CDU-Liberal government could be formed (if so, with a very tiny majority). So it seems that Merkel will have another realistic option to stay Chancellor \u2013 beside the Grand Coalition.\n-\tMerkel is probably least prone to political scandals among the Western leaders and candidates. A Fillon-like scandal in Germany seems very unlikely, but Merkel not even had to witness a scandal like some of her Cabinet members that \u2013 nevertheless \u2013 would not lead to their resignation. And this holds true if one looks back all the years she is in German politics. That makes her approval ratings and her electoral performance a reliable factor to count on.\n-\tSchulz and the SPD lack the magic triangle: a harmonizing combination of (1) Candidate, (2) an issue that voters have an interest in and (3) a favorable media agenda.\nHowever, 84,5 per cent could be too high:\n-\tThere is so much time until elections take place\u2026 Many things can happen. Merkel almost lost safe elections in 2005 against the \u2013 incumbent \u2013 Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Scandals among rank-and-file are always possible, particularly in the CDU \u2013 even if they seem to be harmless in international perspective.\n-\tIt is very likely that the current offspring of the CDU and Liberal polls will normalize a bit an SPD will gain momentum. Too, it is likely that Schulz will find an issue and \u2013 may be, may be \u2013 media agenda will support him (most journalist in Germany lean toward the left side of the political spectrum).\n-\tIt would be very awkward for Merkel and the CDU if there would be a terrorist attack with an Islamic background or something similar: a series of violent crimes with nationwide media coverage committed by refugees or other foreigners (because people blame Merkel personally for the refugee inflow in 2015; and national security and law-and-order is a unique selling point of the CDU).

The victory in North Rhine-Westphalia, home to 18 million people and one in five German voters, dealt a severe blow to Martin Schulz, Ms. Merkel\u2019s Social Democratic challenger, who admitted to a bitter defeat in his home state, traditionally the leftists\u2019 heartland. Cheers erupted at the state headquarters of Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union when early results came in. With almost all ballots counted, the Christian Democrats had won almost 33 percent of votes cast, compared with around 31 percent for the center-left Social Democrats. The national elections are still more than four months away \u2014 a long time in an era of febrile politics across Europe, where mainstream parties have seen their grip weaken in recent elections. But Ms. Merkel, in power since 2005, seems to be bucking the trend, buoyed by experience, a calm temperament and the exceptional economic strength of Germany, which has 4.1 percent unemployment and just last week announced record exports and tax revenues that will exceed expectations by 55 billion euros by 2020.\nMr. Schulz, reacting to the results, said that it was a \u201ctough day\u201d but that he and his party would now focus on winning the national elections in September. A deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Ralf Stegner, conceded minutes after exit polls suggested his party was headed for what he called a \u201cbitter defeat.\u201d The state leader of the party immediately resigned, in a clear effort to deflect blame for the defeat away from Mr. Schulz. Mr. Schulz rode a wave of hype and hope to sudden popularity early this year but has fizzled badly since. By contrast, Ms. Merkel has played up her status as a world leader and savored two unexpected clear victories for her party in other state elections, last week and in late March (para. 1-8).

The FDP is historically weak in Saarland, but regarding B\u201990/ Gr\u00fcne, the CDU\u2019s tactic of painting them as being predisposed towards a red-red-green coalition seems to be bear fruit. The AfD had also a below-average showing with 6% of the vote. In my opinion this is due to a couple of factors:\n1.\tPeople were clearly happy with the work of the last government, with 85% describing their economic situation as good. Saarland has also handled the 2015 refugee influx particularly well.\n2.\tThe populist vote in Saarland skews towards Die Linke, which is prominent there due to former Saarland minister-president and former co-chair of the Linke, Oscar Lafontaine.\n3.\tAs all major political parties have ruled out a coalition with AfD, they are reduced to a pure protest party, which will not be part of a government. In Saarland, the government will most likely remain a great coalition (Gro\u00dfe Koalition) of (a slightly strengthened) CDU and SPD. I would be careful in reading too much into this election with regards to the federal election. While it is a good signal for the CDU, the Saarland with its population of 1m is not necessarily representative. The biggest shifts in the federal election can be expected to be in former GDR states (away from the centre towards the edges of the political spectrum) and in big cities (which favour the SPD)."], [788, "2017-03-27T07:16:21Z", [0.62], ""], [22689, "2017-03-27T06:38:07Z", [0.85], ""], [68, "2017-03-27T06:20:30Z", [0.65], "Edging up from 53% following the regional elections in Saarland, where the CDU increased its vote share from 35 to 40%, while the SDP remained more or less at 30%.

His best applause lines railed against buying more weapons, or argued that even Mr. Trump should hold fast to democratic values.  Anyone who tries to curb the freedom of the news media, Mr. Schulz emphasized, \u201cis laying an ax on the roots of democracy, whether he is the president of the United States or a protester at a rally of Pegida,\u201d the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant movement in Germany. \u201cBoth are unacceptable.\u201d \"After the unanimous endorsement of his election bid, Mr. Schulz jubilantly declared, \u201cThis vote is the start of capturing the chancellery.\u201d  He was nominated as the new party leader only in late January and has since been embraced by the center-left with an \u00e9lan not seen in years. More than 13,000 people have joined the Social Democrats in recent weeks \u2014 a fact celebrated by party leaders even though 2016 membership, at around 438,000, was 130,000 less than a decade earlier. \"Significantly, the 153-year-old Social Democrats have drawn level with Ms. Merkel\u2019s center-right bloc, with both hovering around 31 or 32 percent in polls. Currently, the two govern in a coalition led by Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives.

Included in the sum, which Germany is set to reach over the next decade, is support for United Nations peacekeeping missions and the fight against the Islamic State. \u201cWhat we all want is fair burden-sharing, which requires a modern understanding of security,\u201d Ms. von der Leyen said. \" .  . .Mr. Schulz, who failed to finish high school and is entirely untested in national politics, also represents a risk. But Mr. Schulz, a former bookseller, has a compelling personal story, more than 20 years of experience in European structures and, above all, a message that Germans appear newly eager to hear. Since he was chosen as the Social Democrats\u2019 leader and embraced a simple slogan, \u201cMore Justice,\u201d his party has advanced. Supporters chant \u201cMartin! Martin!\u201d when he appears and wave placards proclaiming that it is \u201ctime for Schulz.\u201d  His rise has apparently blunted the advances of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which now runs around 9 to 10 percent in polls. The Green and Left parties are also stuck around 8 percent each, with the liberal Free Democrats hovering around the 5 percent hurdle that must be cleared to win parliamentary seats. So far, Mr. Schulz has provided almost no details of what his policies might be and says he will outline his program only in late June. Even supporters worry that this leaves him vulnerable. \u201cAt the moment, he is everybody\u2019s darling,\u201d . . .  \u201cHe can bring people along, and he has the right themes.\u201d In addition, . . .  \u201cit is a very important signal that he is someone who has worked so hard for Europe, and at the top of the structure.\u201d Still, . . . more \u201cfresh faces\u201d are needed.  Mr. Schulz sought to appeal to voters of all ages: invoking the iconic Willy Brandt, the Social Democrat who pioneered d\u00e9tente with the Soviets, for older generations and seeking to woo younger ones with concern for their future.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Schulz now leads the largest party in Germany, so theoretically, his party would win the election, and he, as its leader, would be empowered to create a government.  Untested in national politics and lacking policy details, he is a blank slate onto which German voters can project their hopes.

There are two \"mechanisms\" of German politics that are essential for being elected as a Chancellor. First there is the election of course. The party with the most votes obtains the right to ... to select the Chancellor? Not directly. It's the right to form a coalition in order to get the majority in the German Bundestag and then to elect the Chancellor. As a consequence it gets a bit complicated here. Angela Merkel not only need to get the most votes but also a coalition partner to stay in power. Therefore she might be in a difficult situation after the election but her main competitor Martin Schulz is likely to be, too. There are different scenarios possible. If the Christian Democrats win the most votes they have -according to the polls right now- either the option to form a coalition with the Social Democrats or with Liberals and Greens together (current polls indicate Christian Democrats and Greens won't get enough seats in the German Bundestag to be in the majority). There are several obstacles building these coalitions. The Social Democrats are tired of being the junior partner of the Christian Democrats and are likely to refuse a coalition bid (although that is of course not determined). While there would have been less problems to form a coalition solely with the Greens, there is political reservation between them and the Liberals. The Liberals, however, are eager to get in the Bundestag after their humiliating defeat at the last election (in the following of a coalition with Merkel's Christian Democrats in government) and may be reluctant to get directly into government again. So even if the Christian Democrats win the election it is not determined she will be the next Chancellor. The chances of Martin Schulz being elected also depend on two aspects: firstly, the winning the election with the Social Democrats. Then there are two options to form a coalition. Either they form a coalition with the Christian Democrats or with the Left Party and the Greens. Even then there are still obstacles. And that's culminate into the second aspect: the ideological barriers of the Left Party.  A Red-Red-Green Coalition not only has to come to an agreement regarding central interior policies such as security but also concerning their foreign policy. The Left Party cannot accept the foreign policy position of Social Democrats and Greens as long as they don't want to lose the credibility of their party base. Demands to leave NATO and to ease relations to Russia are unlikely to be fulfilled (at least in the radical form they propose) and would put the Left Party into identity crisis. Forming such a coalition therefore depends upon the flexibility and power interest of the Left Party and their leading figures. It's not clear if the chance to govern enable them to leave ideology behind. Thus, a coalition with the Christian Democrats could be the easiest way for Social Democrats to get Martin Schulz elected (although it is not clear to what consequences a defeat by the Social Democrats would lead in Merkel's party). Thus, I would argue from a coalition perspective it's relatively easier for Merkel to get elected than for Martin Schulz.  But what about the chance to get the most votes in the general election? It'll be a tight race. Nevertheless, I guess Merkel will win in the end but probably only with a low margin. Nowadays a lot is influenced by European and International politics and she has a high reputation and a lot of experience in these branches in Germany - even though and for some Germans because of her dealing with immigration questions. As long as Martin Schulz doesn't challenge her there and present a coherent policy and experienced personal she will still have the whiphand in the end."], [34069, "2017-03-02T11:05:06Z", [0.52], "People are tired of Merkel and Schulz seems like a strong candidate.

But as the year progresses, with strong populist showings possible in the Dutch and French elections, German voters are likely to value responsible leadership even more. However, in choosing their leader Germans are likely to plump again for what they see as the safest pair of hands: those belonging to their long-reigning chancellor.\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/europe/21715589-they-will-probably-still-lose-angela-merkel-germanys-social-democrats-pick-martin-schulz\n_________________________________\nCOMMENTS: Interesting article above.

She remains popular, and her party, the CDU, in alliance with its Bavarian partner, the CSU, is ahead in polls and is expected, at present, to be the largest party, again, in the new Bundestag. However - a lot can happen between now and the elections (scheduled for 24 September). Obviously \"Europe\" and \"immigration\" are the two big issues. The knock-on effects of Brexit - and how negotiations progress, and the manner in which they are conducted; and of a possible rise in support for nationalist/sovereignist parties at elections earlier in the year in the Netherlands and in France - may also be expected to flavour German political discourse.  The potential for Italian economic crisis - and how Germany could meaningfully respond to that.  The approach that Trump takes towards NATO may also be significant. A lot of \"known unknowns\" in short. Then: domestic German matters: the SPD will have a new leader, Martin Schulz, returning to Berlin from the European Parliament - a large figure strongly committed to European integration. The rise, at least in some of Germany's Lands, of the Alternativ fuer Deutschland - who mix healthy (if unusual, in the present German context) EU-scepticism, with far murkier Nazi-revivalist elements, above all in the East. The prospect (probability, even), of more Islamic terrorist attacks - either in Germany itself, or elsewhere in Europe, and their impact on public mood and debate. And the potential for dissent between the CSU and CDU (the CSU being generally more conservative) - potentially the CSU could demand a common candidate for Chancellor with a less pro-immigration policy than Merkel (for all that she has backwheeled on some of her 2015 stances).... So a combination of factors, both international and domestic, could serve, together, potentially, to undermine Merkel's standing, as, in effect, the most powerful leader in continental Europe. It is all purely potential at present, but after a year of near-revolutionary developments in the UK and US, and with the potential for France, especially, to be similarly effected (eg both of its main parties having had their anticipated presidential candidates sidelined in favour of less mainstream contenders), it would be foolish to entirely rule out something related happening, even in what on the surface remains solid, stable, well-functioning, Germany."], [12879, "2017-01-24T19:01:11Z", [0.75], ""], [23234, "2017-01-24T18:49:01Z", [0.7], ""], [4634, "2017-01-24T18:42:20Z", [0.78], "Schultz will run for the SPD after all.
