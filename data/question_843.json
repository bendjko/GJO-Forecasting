The views expressed are his own By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Eleven years ago, on Monday Sept. 24, 2007, the price of Brent crude closed just below $79 per barrel, not far from where it is today. Three days later, Brent closed above $80 for the first time in history. Less than 10 months after that, prices closed at an all-time high of $146. Past prices are not necessarily a guide to the future, but the events of 2007/08 are a reminder that price moves are highly non-linear, especially around turning points in the cycle. Price moves tend to accelerate in the run-up to cyclical peaks and troughs, as the market struggles to overcome a worsening deficit or surplus. As a result, oil prices tend to rise far higher, and fall much further, than commentators thought possible just a few months earlier.   A DISTANT MIRROR The current situation in the global economy and the oil market has many similarities to what happened in 2007 and 2008. In the earlier episode, the global economy had been expanding strongly for several years, with rapid growth in oil consumption. The U.S. economic cycle peaked in December 2007, though that was not evident until about a year afterwards, and oil prices continued rising for another seven months. Yields on short-term U.S. Treasury notes peaked around June 2007 and U.S. equity markets hit their pinnacle in October 2007. Most of the other major industrial economies tipped into recession in the second half of 2007 or the first half of 2008. In the oil market, persistent concerns about demand destruction were raised, but dismissed by many participants, and validated only after prices peaked. The introduction of new low-sulphur standards for distillate fuel oil in the United States led to concerns about the availability of enough sweet crude. There were mounting concerns about the exhaustion of OPEC\u2019s spare capacity and the organisation\u2019s ability to add more medium-sweet barrels to meet demand from refiners.   OPEC STAYS ON SIDELINE Throughout 2007 and early 2008, OPEC leaders continued to insist the oil market was adequately supplied and they would make additional barrels available if refiners requested them. But the Brent market moved into a sharp backwardation in the second half of 2007 and the first four months of 2008, indicating traders were concerned about oil availability. In September 2007, OPEC agreed to increase its collective production by 500,000 barrels per day from the start of November, citing the tightness in U.S. fuel markets and the shift in crude futures into backwardation. In December 2007, however, OPEC\u2019s conference judged the market remained well supplied and that crude and product stocks were at comfortable levels and decided not to increase output further. In March 2008, the conference continued to judge the market well supplied, noting growing downside risks in the world economy, and blamed the continued rise in oil prices on non-fundamental factors, especially speculators. In May, the organisation\u2019s secretary-general issued a statement saying \u201cthere is clearly no shortage of oil in the market\u201d and blaming speculative funds for the increasing volatility in crude oil. The organisation promised to be proactive in monitoring developments and act if necessary to ensure a stable and balanced market but did not promise additional barrels. Prices continued to accelerate higher and became increasingly volatile, with $5-per-day price moves becoming frequent, and many traders pulling back from making markets due to the increase in risk. OPEC insisted throughout that oil supplies were adequate, Saudi Arabia and other members would provide more oil, if refiners asked, but that prices were being driven by non-fundamental factors. Eventually, the backwardation began to break down in May and spot prices started to fall from early July as the financial and economic outlook deteriorated. With the intensification of the financial crisis in September 2008, the global economy headed deeper into recession through the second half of the year and in the first half of 2009.   WILL HISTORY REPEAT? Could the same sequence of events play out in 2018/19? The U.S. economy and financial markets are again at a relatively late stage in the current cyclical expansion. In the rest of the world, the global outlook is softening, with the balance of risks tilted towards the downside, according to many forecasters. Oil consumption growth has been strong but may be starting to soften, though as usual this will not be certain until after the event. Six-month Brent calendar spreads are trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is comparable to the corresponding point in September 2007. New pollution regulations will tighten sulphur specifications for marine fuels from the start of 2020, which will put pressure on the availability of medium-density and sweet crudes. There are reported shortages of medium crudes as imminent sanctions reduce the export of medium-density oil from Iran (\u201cSaudi Arabia worries oil crunch could push up prices\u201d, Wall Street Journal\u201d, Sept. 21). Saudi Arabia says it has enough spare capacity to increase production by another 1.5 million barrels per day but some market participants are sceptical about the amount and the quality. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers concluded on Sunday the overall balance between supply and demand remains healthy. But hedge funds have amassed a large bullish position in Brent crude, amounting to almost 470 million barrels, betting prices will head even higher."], [15196, "2018-09-24T14:56:01Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [10612, "2018-09-24T14:18:08Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.8], ""], [29102, "2018-09-24T13:53:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.85], ""], [46762, "2018-09-24T13:11:53Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.93], "Stunning graph on oil inventories.

Some in the market seem worried about Chinese oil demand slowing down which would have a sizable effect.\n-The prior two factors are counteracting (partially or fully) the effect of US sanctions on Iran, which has been pushing prices higher.\n-Market sentiment is probably turning bearish. The price jumped on Sept 4 but retraced all its gains, in a day that saw high liquidity and active trading, signaling that a lot of selling pressure around 80 is overwhelming the buyers (number of buyers  and sellers is the same but the latter are more aggressive). This is a classic reversal sign that signals to analysts and traders an increased likelihood of an end to the upward trend. As a round number and a level that has been touched recently, 80 is a natural point for many traders and algorithm developers to place as a selling point. i.e. there would have to be a strong reason for the price to breach that level and I don't see one yet after looking at the fundamentals.\n-Impact of Libya and Nigeria's upcoming elections on oil output could cause future swings.

I see this as one of the main constraints on the upside for Brent.  None of this is so far factoring in market psychology though, which might very well end up being the overriding factor in this timeframe. The trade war with China is a major bearish factor sentiment-wise. I am guessing that what's playing out right now will have ended before October. It's hurting both sides both economically and politically. Trump and the Republicans in Congress will want something they can tout as a win before the elections. If things get resolved before October, I'd expect to see some bullishness. Also of note: this analyst poll [3] which is making me a bit more bearish. Might revise a bit to the downside.

West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1% to close at $73.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since November 2014. Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 0.3% to $77.85 (Para. 1-2). The U.S. exported a record-smashing 21 million barrels of crude oil last week, or 3 million barrels daily, the EIA said, noting oil exports are averaging 1.8 million barrels a day this year, 140% more than this time last year. Enabling those huge exports has been a consistent $10 per barrel discount on U.S.-produced oil, whose benchmark is WTI, compared with the higher-priced global benchmark Brent. Such a huge difference in prices makes U.S.-produced oil an easy sell to oil importers overseas such as China, as price is the main factor (Para. 5). But the 13% rally in U.S. oil prices over the past week and a half, from less than $65 a barrel to more than $73 a barrel, is causing that WTI discount to Brent to narrow significantly, to about $4. And since shipping costs alone from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia can run $3 a barrel or more, U.S. oil producers may find it difficult to maintain its record-setting export volumes, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service (Para. 5-6).

U.S. crude futures fell 94 cents, or 1.37%, to $67.70 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 85 cents, or 1.14%, to $73.86 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, snapping a five session winning streak. The prospect that the U.S. will soon pull out of the deal, triggering renewed sanctions that could curb Iranian production and tighten the oil market, helped push Brent as high as $75.47 a barrel in earlier trading, the highest since 2014. The U.S. is due to review its position on the agreement\u2014which eased sanctions on the Islamic Republic in return for curbs on its nuclear program\u2014on May 12. Market participants parsed mixed statements about the prospects for the Iran deal throughout the day Tuesday as President Donald Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who has pushed for the U.S. to remain in the nuclear pact (para. 1-5).

Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled up 32 cents, or 0.5%, to $67.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since December 2014. Brent, the global benchmark, advanced 56 cents, or 0.8%, to $72.58 a barrel. Prices have climbed as supply cuts from major oil exporters and strong global demand have helped ease a longstanding glut. Increased geopolitical risk has also put a premium on crude, as production from countries like Iran and Syria has been threatened. Most recently, the prospect of potential military action by Western countries in Syria has elevated concerns over available supply. Around two-thirds of the world\u2019s oil reserves are in the Middle East. \u201cThe excess inventory of oil around the world is no longer there to act as a buffer when these flare-ups in the Middle East happen,\u201d said analysts at TAC Energy. In its closely watched monthly oil-market report Friday, the IEA said it still expects the world\u2019s appetite for oil to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018, helping to partly offset surging U.S. shale-oil growth (para. 1-6).

More recently, the price has come down from a technical resistance close to $70. Summary of my guess: On the whole, my suspicion is that the threat of supply disruptions looms larger than the downside risks (mentioned below). On the bearish side, the threat of a trade war between the U.S. and other major economies (e.g. China) could dampen sentiment in the market. My suspicion is that despite the bluster the Trump Administration will want to avoid a trade war, but this administration has shown to be difficult to predict. If a trade ware is avoided, this would be bullish because some risk has already been priced in. Another limiting factor is from potential additional supply from U.S. shale producers who could ramp up production if prices continue to rise. Additionally, a correction from the long-term uptrend is possible as speculative traders lock in profits. On the bullish side, supply disruptions could push prices higher (disruptions could come from Venezuela and the Middle East with a potential end to the Iran nuclear deal). The Iran nuclear agreement in particular seems to be headed toward collapse, especially with Pompeo as a Secretary of State and John Bolton as an advisor to the President.  A supporting factor is potential discipline that OPEC and Russia may exhibit in keeping supplies tight. Some suggest that the social cost of a barrel (which factors in the oil-revenue-fueled government spending that Middle Eastern producers rely on to maintain their regimes) is around $60 (https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21735059-and-why-it-might-not-fall-very-much-soon-why-oil-price-so-high).

Recently there is an uptrend in oil prices [1] and the futures price for every month until Nov 2018 is above $66. I think that means below $60 in Oct is very unlikely. So I give 0% to <$50 and 5% to $50-$60. On the other hand, eyeballing the chart over last year it feels like maybe on roughly 5% of 6-month periods we saw a $15+ increase, which would bring us to over $80. So say 5% chance of >$80. Today you can buy one barrel of oil for $66.54 and store it for 6 months for ~$6 [2]. That means you can have one barrel of oil in Oct for $72. Oct oil futures are $66.65 as of this writing [3]. I'm not really sure how to interpret this. Let's try to work through it. According to CME, 97% of oil futures trades are done by people who don't really want the oil, but are just trying to make money off of it [4]. (I.e. 97% of people who buy a futures contract do not in the end take the barrel of oil at expiration, but sell it before expiry.) So suppose I am such a trader, and I have $66.65. I can invest this in a 6-month treasury and get 1.89% return [5], i.e. have $67.91 in Oct. That's very low risk. So if I'm buying this oil futures contract instead, which is much more volatile, I must think there's a good chance I'll sell it for substantially more than $67.91 at some point in the next 6 months. And note that as time passes, the price for the Oct contract must converge to the spot price. So, I divide the remaining 90% into 50%/40% for $60-$70 and $70-80 respectively. But not very confident.

I have yet to find a clear explanation of \"backwardation\", but apparently it has something to do with: people who own oil now would rather use it now than sell a futures contract for it.

The Paris-based IEA raised its forecast for oil demand growth in 2018 to 1.4 million barrels per day, from a previous projection of 1.3 million bpd, after the International Monetary Fund upped its estimate of global economic growth for this year and next. However, the rapid rise in output, particularly in the United States, could well outweigh any pick-up in demand and begin to push up global oil inventories, which are now within sight of their five-year average. \u201cToday, having cut costs dramatically, U.S. producers are enjoying a second wave of growth so extraordinary that in 2018 their increase in liquids production could equal global demand growth,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cIn just three months to November, (U.S.) crude output increased by a colossal 846,000 bpd and will soon overtake that of Saudi Arabia. By the end of this year, it might also overtake Russia to become the global leader.\u201d U.S. crude output could reach 11 million bpd by the end of this year, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with other exporters such as Russia, have agreed to maintain a joint restriction on crude supply for a second year running in 2018, to force inventories to drain and support prices. Oil inventories across the world\u2019s richest nations fell by 55.6 million barrels in December to 2.851 billion barrels, their steepest one-month drop since February 2011, the IEA said. For 2017 as a whole, inventories fell by 154 million barrels, or at a rate of 420,000 bpd. By the year-end they were only 52 million barrels above the five-year average, with stocks of oil products below that benchmark, the IEA said. \u201cWith the surplus having shrunk so dramatically, the success of the output agreement might be close to hand. This, however, is not necessarily the case: oil price rises have come to a halt and gone into reverse, and, according to our supply/demand balance, so might the decline in oil stocks, at least in the early part of this year.\u201d Oil production outside OPEC nations fell by 175,000 bpd in January to 58.6 million bpd, but was still 1.3 million bpd higher than January last year, predominantly because of the 1.3-million-bpd year-on-year increase in U.S. output. OPEC output was largely steady at 32.16 million bpd in January and compliance with the supply deal reached 137 percent, due in part to declines in Venezuela, where economic crisis has paralyzed much of the country\u2019s oil production capacity. The IEA estimates demand for OPEC\u2019s crude in 2018 will average 32.3 million bpd, after dropping to 32.0 million in the first quarter of the year. The IEA said oil prices, which briefly touched a high of $71 a barrel in January, could be supported even if U.S. production rises, provided global growth remains strong, or if unplanned supply outages persist. \u201cIf so, most producers will be happy, but if not, history might be repeating itself,\u201d the IEA said.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said world oil demand would rise by 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, an increase of 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast. \u201cRecently, healthy and steady economic development in major global oil demand centers was the key driver behind strong oil demand growth,\u201d Vienna-based OPEC said in the report. \u201cThis close linkage between economic growth and oil demand is foreseen to continue, at least for the short term.\u201d Oil prices held on to earlier gains after the release of the report, trading just below $64 a barrel. Prices topped $70 this year for the first time since late 2014, supported by the OPEC-led cut and robust demand. Balancing the higher demand forecast, OPEC said the United States and other outside producers would boost supply by 1.4 million bpd this year, up 250,000 bpd from last month and the third consecutive rise from 870,000 bpd in November. \u201cThe steady oil price recovery since summer 2017 and renewed interest in growth opportunities have led to oil majors catching up in terms of exploration activity this year, both in the shale industry and offshore deep water,\u201d OPEC said, referring to the U.S. outlook. \u201cThe market is only expected to return to balance towards the end of this year.\u201d INVENTORIES, OPEC OUTPUT FALLING OPEC\u2019s assessment of when the market would rebalance is no earlier than its previous projection, despite the outlook for higher demand, falling inventories and strong compliance with the supply-cutting deal. OPEC\u2019s stated goal, through a deal starting a year ago to cut output with Russia and other outside producers, is to reduce oil inventories in developed economies to the five-year average. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018. In a further sign of progress, OPEC said inventories in those economies declined by 22.9 million barrels in December to 2.888 billion barrels, 109 million above the five-year average. OPEC compliance remains strong. In January, OPEC output fell by 8,000 bpd to 32.302 million bpd, the report said. Adherence by the members with output targets rose to 137 percent, according to a Reuters calculation, up from December. The report gave contrasting figures on production in Venezuela, where output has been dropping due to an economic crisis. Venezuela told OPEC its production recovered in January to 1.769 million bpd from December\u2019s multi-decade low, while figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor its output showed a decline to 1.60 million bpd, a new low. OPEC uses an average of figures from six secondary sources to monitor its output rather than countries\u2019 own due to old disputes about real production rates. With outside producers expected to increase supply this year by more than the upward revision to demand, OPEC in the report cut its estimate of the global requirement for its crude in 2018 by 230,000 bpd to 32.86 million bpd. Should OPEC keep pumping at January\u2019s level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 560,000 bpd, suggesting inventories will be drawn down further. Last month\u2019s report pointed to a larger deficit of about 670,000 bpd."], [172, "2018-04-02T01:49:47Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.6, 0.35, 0.0], ""], [57300, "2018-04-01T23:53:58Z", [0.16, 0.72, 0.12, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-04-01T17:11:07Z", [0.0, 0.06, 0.63, 0.31, 0.0], ""], [53981, "2018-04-01T16:43:53Z", [0.0, 0.43, 0.47, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [57456, "2018-04-01T15:33:46Z", [0.05, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [28858, "2018-04-01T15:11:02Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.0], "Strength of US economy"], [29646, "2018-04-01T03:58:48Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.4, 0.0], ""], [57427, "2018-04-01T03:04:42Z", [0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [368, "2018-04-01T02:59:30Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-03-31T17:35:10Z", [0.0, 0.07, 0.63, 0.3, 0.0], ""], [705, "2018-03-31T15:36:38Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.48, 0.32, 0.05], ""], [593, "2018-03-31T14:30:02Z", [0.05, 0.15, 0.6, 0.1, 0.1], ""], [57302, "2018-03-31T07:07:16Z", [0.05, 0.35, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2018-03-30T20:43:07Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [28166, "2018-03-30T16:16:59Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.74, 0.16, 0.0], ""], [691, "2018-03-30T15:21:32Z", [0.0, 0.09, 0.62, 0.29, 0.0], ""], [30610, "2018-03-30T11:35:22Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.75, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [35636, "2018-03-30T06:05:50Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.9, 0.1, 0.0], "97-3 now 90-10 Bolton factor, Iran sanctions talk and new Chinese yuan-based oil futures went hot.

A lot of factors go into this.  First.  Season adjustment.  Over the last 30 years, pricing adjustment between February and October is +9%. Second.  Overall, the global economy is very strong.   US growth is hovering around 3%.  European growth is strong (for Europe); China continues chugging along.  This argues to the upside.    Global domand is forecast to increase 1.4 mbd, compared to an actual increase ingrowth of 1.6 mbd in 2017. Third: Production\nEIA figures US will increase from 9.6 million to 9.8 million over the course of this year.  EIA estimates have consistently been on the pessimistic  side.   In just three months, US production increased 846,000 barrels per day.  (nov 2017); and as of feb. are 10.3mbd. Most of Opec does not have the capacity to increase production.  Exceptions are Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia.   Russia also has the ability to increase production. Contravening that, Venezuela production has cratered.  EIA estimates for Venezuelan production is 1.5-1.6mb/d.   Judging merely by output collapse over the last 3 months, I believe actual production will exit the year at 1-1.1 mb/d.   Opec Sanctions.    Factoring in the previous assumptions:\nDemand +1.8 mbd  (1.7 oct)\nVenezuela Production -.4 mbd (-.3 oct)\nUS production +1.2 mbd Means that demand will increase more than supply.  Opec will have a choice:  Increase production, or maintain production cuts.   Saudi Arabia has the capacity to swing production 300k barrels already.     Volatility:  All volatility factors:  hurricanes, and military action in libya, nigeria etc are to the upside.\nException:  US sales from Strategic Reserve.

U.S. crude futures recently traded up 52 cents, or 0.83%, to $63.29 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 51 cents, or 0.77%, to $66.90 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. Friday\u2019s move builds on gains Thursday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported the amount of crude oil in storage in the U.S. fell by 1.6 million barrels last week. The unexpected decline followed weeks of crude storage builds that had added to pressure on the price of crude. The EIA also reported Thursday that weekly production edged down slightly from a record high. In addition, supplies have been draining rapidly from the delivery hub in Cushing, Okla. Stockpiles of oil there have fallen to their lowest level in more than three years, also helping to lift prices. \u201cWe went through a correction.

However, by checking the CME future oil markets for Brent contracts has shifted into backwardation since Sept last year - a state when spot prices are higher than prices for futures contracts, creating a downward-sloping curve for futures prices.  Now the NYMEX BZV2018 future contract price as today 21/02/18 closed @ 63.50 and the spot price is trading higher. So what factors contribute to sustaining higher/stable oil prices in the short and medium term? My best guess lays on the OPEC and the Non-OPEC (Russia) to maintain the current agreement in production compliance which gives an edge for the OPEC members to sell their inventory closer to the spot price while U.S. shale producers hedge a significant volume of their production in the futures market. Therefore, markets in backwardation may give rise to roll yield opportunities for commodity traders, by a simple put, with the oil market in backwardation theoretically commodities traders can roll short-term contract into a longer-term contract and generate a positive return from being long in oil even if the spot price doesn't change. The incoming summer in the Northern Hemisphere will determine whether the incentive to not cheat among the OPEC members will dictate the spot price in the short and medium term.

On average the price changes by 0.11% each month, with a standard deviation of 9.03% (i.e. about two thirds of the time the monthly change in price is within the range 0.11% +/- 9.03%).  I then created a Monte Carlo model to simulate 1000 scenarios of price changes from the end of Jan 2018 to the end of Sept 2018, which gave me the distributions above. This seems to be a wider distribution than most other people are forecasting. This might be partly because the price has been a bit more stable over the last few years, so maybe going back 10 years is a bit too far. Also, maybe people are assuming that the recent growth will taper off soon.

The better question this time around is what will happen to demand and volatility in the oil market. The supply argument is the easy one and both big drivers point to an increase in crude. This dynamic has dominated oil markets since the \u201csheikhs vs shale\u201d showdown began around four years ago, sending oil into a sharp year-and-a-half long swoon. Only the numbers have changed. Once upon a time, it seemed that when oil fell to $70, U.S. frackers would lose money and stop drilling. Since then, shale producers have gotten more efficient, so with the price at $70, expect more U.S. supply. The U.S. Energy Information Administration just updated its forecast for U.S. production in 2018 to 10.3 million barrels a day, a full million barrels higher than its forecast this time a year ago. That would be a new annual record, eclipsing the 1970 high. If production does keep rising, it will likely remain high until late 2018, whatever the price does (para. 1-3). The other side of the equation tells a different story. Right now, bullish speculative bets on oil futures are at their highest level ever. Typically, that is a sign of overconfidence and the market tends to fall (para. 5). There are some potential geopolitical triggers for a sharp rally such as political instability in Saudi Arabia or Iran, an open conflict between the regional rivals or a spillover from their proxy contest in Yemen to nearby crude transport waterways. Finally, Venezuela\u2019s deteriorating output could turn into an outright collapse given unrest there. Consumption growth would seem obvious given the booming global economy. Yet much of the recent gains can be pinned on China, which has been aggressively filling commercial and government inventories. Analysts wonder if a lack of storage space will lead to a sharp slowdown. OPEC itself sees Chinese demand growth this year being the slowest since the crisis year of 2008 (para. 5-7). Jakab, S.

Boosted by a resurgent shale industry, U.S. crude production should climb above 10 million barrels a day in 2018, an all-time high not seen since 1970, the agency said Friday in its closely watched monthly oil market report. U.S. producers have been able to open the spigots largely as a result of the recent rally in crude prices. The price of Brent crude\u2014the global benchmark\u2014has risen roughly 50% since 2017 lows in June (para. 1-3). Prices have been supported by efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to eliminate about 1.8 million barrels a day of global output to rein in a global supply glut that has weighed on prices for over three years (para. 5). But U.S. production offset around 60% of those cuts, the agency said. The agency\u2019s data point to an alarming rise in non-OPEC supply that could delay a much-anticipated rebalancing of the oil market. Official data sources, however, vary widely in their expectations for crude output outside the global cartel. OPEC is projecting an increase of 1.15 million barrels per day of non-OPEC supply in 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, however, expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 2 million barrels per day, and the IEA sees an increase of 1.7 million barrels per day, which analysts say is higher than the projected growth in global oil demand (para. 5-9).

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down 0.28% at $63.49 a barrel. Oil prices have risen this year by over 3%, near highs last seen in 2014, on the back of geopolitical turmoil in key producing regions and efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some producers outside the cartel to reduce output and rein in a global supply glut that has weighed on prices for over three years (para. 1-3).
