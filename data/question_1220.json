With the decline of IS, the remaining conflicts are between the government and PKK. There were civilian casualties in the past conflicts.  But the number of fatalities due to these conflicts is relatively low compared with other countries, especially for civilians.  For example, the Crisis Group has documented over 4000 fatalities in the 4 years since July 2015 [1]. Only about 400 were civilians.   You can also use the Crisis Group interactive tool to examine the fatalities at different time periods.  In general, the civilian fatalities were very low, much lower than 1000.  I don't foresee a major flare up that will break this baseline.
