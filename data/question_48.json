It seems clear from polls that Tsai will win the Presidency as almost all of the undecided voters would have to break against her for her to lose.  The more interesting question (and the subject of the question) is, what about the legislature? Based on the past two elections (which were won by the KMT), a presidential candidate winning more than 50% of the vote corresponds to a legislative majority (even though the KMT popular share of the vote was smaller in legislative elections). Assuming that the remaining voters split equally between the main candidates (which is probably a conservative estimate), the DPP could likely do sufficiently well nationally to gain a legislative majority.

Assuming these polls are accurate, I tried to find some numerical correlations between the polls and the final results in 2014, and attempt to apply those results to the 2016 election. While an unchanged electorate should produce no exciting surprises on election night, it makes forecasting a little easier. Analyzing the data, I found that the DPP performed on average 18% better in the final result than the polls. More worryingly for the KMT, the DPP outperformed by even larger margins in competitive races: in close races, the DPP outperformed polls by 23%. If we assume the polls are accurate, and no committed voter changes his/her mind, then that means over 2/3 of voters who were uncommitted in the polls were won over by the DPP in the final moments of the election. Since studies consistently showed that generally sizeable number of voters decide only toward the end of the election, we may end up seeing the same effect here. As it stand, the polls indicate DPP 31%, KMT 18%, and undecided 24%. Therefore, we may see actual DPP support over 45%. This is a little more than KMT support in 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, in which they won 64 seats. Only 16 of these 64 are general seats and I am not familiar enough with Taiwan to make any comment about the distribution of support for the parties, but if we see stronger than expected DPP support in competitive races like in 2014, matching the 2012 KMT numbers is certainly reasonable. Admittedly, my analysis include many assumptions and ball park estimates.

Although I had heard of the Sunflower Movement and studied the history of China and Taiwan, I had not at all followed any of the political events in any level of detail. Currently the two leading parties in Taiwan  are the KMT and DPP. The major political issues are the relationship with China and the economy (which are obviously two very interlinked issues). The two main and opposing views with respect to both these issues, is whether Mainland China and Taiwan should be unified into one country, or if Taiwan is and forever will be a separate nation. The DPP and its affiliated parties, known as the Pan-Green coalition, assert that Taiwan is a separate country from the PRC. The KMT and its affiliated parties, known as the Pan-Blue coalition, assert the opposite and have as their aim either a closer relationship with China or in some cases even a total unification of the PRC and Taiwan. The KMT have dominated politics since 1947, with the DPP having some control on and off in the last ten years. As of 2009, the KMT led government has been rapidly improving the political and economic relationship with China, and China is now one of the closest trading partners of Taiwan. It should be noted that both the KMT and DPP leadership have in the past been accused of corruption on several different occasions. There are other political parties in Taiwan, however they are minority parties that are already closely aligned with either the DPP or KMT. This alignment is mainly related to the discussion of whether Taiwan should be an independent nation, or whether Taiwan and mainland China should reunite. Channel News Asia summarizes how the elections will work here: \u201cElection day is on Saturday, Jan 16. With the voting age set at 20, there are more than 18 million eligible voters, who can cast their ballots at 15,582 polling stations across the island between 8am and 4pm. Unofficial results will be out on the evening the polls close, while official results will be announced within 7 days. [...] Apart from electing a president, voters get two other ballots to determine the makeup of the 113-seat legislature. The first of these is a direct vote for legislative candidates and the second is a party vote. Taiwan\u2019s hybrid electoral system means that under the first ballot, the majority of the seats (73) are up for grabs via first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies. An additional six seats belong to two three-member indigenous constituencies. The second ballot, or the party vote, fills the remaining 34 seats via closed-list proportional representation.\u201d To answer this question so close to the deadline, I decided to take the most recent polling information as the outside view. I would then look at the polls and try and see which factors could significantly change the predictions at the last minute. I also looked to see what factors could influence unsure voters, or voters voting for minority parties with only a very small chance to win. I also learnt that starting from the 6th of January there is an official \u201cpolling blackout\u201d in Taiwan.  So I would also have to adjust the polling numbers for things that had happened since then. Additionally, I read through a bunch of opinion pieces and blogs related to Taiwanese politics (https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/) and decided to stay away from any polls released by any organizations affiliated to any political parties or governmental organisations. Finding good polling data regarding the legislative Yuan was very hard. I observed that many people here are using the presidential election polls as a proxy for the polls regarding the Yuan - which I think may be a good indicator of how the legislative elections will go.  This is where I got stuck. My lack of Mandarin skills and being a bit pressed on time meant I could not find too much good data. In the end I was fortunate to stumble across some great articles by Kharis Templeman and Nathan Batto: http://www.kharistempleman.com/blog/forecasting-the-2016-taiwan-legislative-elections, http://www.kharistempleman.com/blog/so-about-that-election-forecast, https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/a-response-to-khariss-forecast/.\n\nBoth these blog entries prompted me to change my approach and set the following outside probabilities:\n80% chance of DPP Majority\n12% chance of DPP Plurality\n8% chance of DPP Not a Plurality (Minority).\nThese numbers are based on the research above, and then appended with gut feelings and estimations about what I have read.\n\nThe main factors I considered that support the Majority or Plurality outcome:\n* Young voters will vote DPP because it is a change from the status quo.\n* Young voters will increasingly vote DPP, as they have grown up in Taiwan and see it as an independent nation. \u201cA survey conducted in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese only.\u201d\n* Tsai is playing her cards well, she is not pro-Beijing but is also not too vocally anti-china, meaning I don\u2019t believe she has scared away those dependent on China for economic reasons.\n* As discussed in the articles above, I believe votes for Tsai and her policies will also translate into list votes for parties.There's a small chance that smaller independent parties will take votes from the KMT and DPP. However, I feel that the DPP is still regarded as an outsider enough that the KMT will lose more votes in this case.\n* Frustration regarding economic factors and the relationship with China are the driving issues in this election. DPP offers the only real change in the status quo for the average citizen.\n\nThe Minority outcome is based on the following possibilities:\n* Military confrontation with China. Although I think this would actually lead to more DPP votes, as it would discredit the KMT ethos that closer economic ties with China would make it more painful for China to attack. I also think there is a possibility that the older generations of Taiwanese as well as swing voters would change their votes to KMT and perceive the KMT as being the party that protected them in the past.\n* Minority parties may eat up more seats than expected. With increasing democracy there is always the chance that fringe parties eat away at the voter base of the core parties. An example of a candidate for this is the NPP party.\n* Corruption scandal in the DPP. I do not think this will happen realistically, but in the past both parties have had leaders involved in various scandals. If a serious scandal did occur with the DPP leadership, it may cost them significant votes. On the other hand, I think any scandal that could come out already would have by now.\n\nThis was an interesting question to answer, but very difficult, and I am not fully confident of my answer. I fear my analysis isn\u2019t too interesting either - I had hoped to be able to offer a more interesting point of view. My long term prediction is that Tsai will end up being not much different to Ma. The policy of working closely with China economically will continue, as I think it is the easiest way to address the many economic issues facing the Taiwanese population, although it may take a different format than it did under the KMT in recent years.

At least not enough to seriously threaten their likely majority. Why? The DPP and NPP have been coordinating to some degree so as not to split the pan-green vote in any particular district. Regarding legislator-at-large seats, I believe the DPP officials are downplaying expectations so as to get a good turnout. They're saying it would be difficult for them to win 16 of these party list seats, but I would be very surprised if they didn't win at least 17 (of 34) seats. The NPP could win between 2 and 4 of these seats. Seven, as one DPP official suggested, strikes me as far-fetched. Then there is the added consideration of the pan-blue parties, too. I'm not sure whether the KMT and PFP are coordinating so as not to split their vote in some districts. The PFP might hurt the KMT more than the NPP hurts the DPP. Right now my guess for the at-large seats is: Pan-Green 21 (19 DPP, 2 NPP, 0 TSU)\nPan-Blue 13 (13 KMT, 0 PFP) Rule of thumb: approximately 3% of the national vote = 1 legislator-at-large seat.

Deep green supporters make up 35 percent of Yunlin's electorate, towering over deep blue supporters' 22 percent. Both legislative seats in the county appear to be up for grabs for the DPP. Liu Chien-kuo (\u5289\u5efa\u570b), a former Yunlin County councilor, was elected to the Legislature in 2012. Liu, who gained fame for his physical resemblance to Japanese actor Nakamura Shido II, has been recognized multiple times for \"excellency\" by the political observer group Citizen Congress Watch (\u516c\u6c11\u76e3\u7763\u570b\u6703\u806f\u76df). Some believe Liu will grab a record high number of votes in this year's legislative election for the DPP. He has an 86.5-percent chance of winning the seat, according to forecaster Exchange of Wisdom. Su Chih-fen (\u8607\u6cbb\u82ac), another candidate nominated by the DPP, comes from a family with deep-rooted political ties. Both of her parents and sister have served in county or provincial council positions. Su herself was a legislator, an Executive Yuan advisor and a member of the now defunct National Assembly. In 2009, she was elected Yunlin magistrate with 66.55 percent of votes, the highest of the DPP camp. Over her eight-year tenure Su has methodically built up her pan-green base and diminished her Kuomintang (KMT) opponent's power. Exchange of Wisdom puts her chance of victory at 75 percent. Chiayi's Three Seats Going to DPP The three candidates representing the DPP have a high chance of winning the legislative election in Chiayi, according to survey statistics. The county's green supporters account for 47 percent of the electorate, 14 percentage points greater than the pan-blue's 33 percent. In the county's legislative District 1, Tsai Yi-yu (\u8521\u6613\u9918) already has an 86-percent chance of victory. Tsai, who sits on the DPP's central executive committee, represents the second political generation of his family. His father is a former legislator, while both his grandfather and great-grandfather were local representatives. He also has the Chiayi County magistrate's support. In District 2, the DPP dispatched two-term legislator Chen Ming-wen (\u9673\u660e\u6587), who has deep connections in the local business and political spheres. His father owns a thriving shipment business while his older brother was a former National Assembly member. With pollsters placing Chen's victory at 89-percent probability, the DPP looks certain to win. Incumbent legislator Lee Chun-yi (\u674e\u4fca\u4fcb) represents the Chiayi City district for the DPP. With his tenure as Chiayi deputy mayor, a civil service vice minister and as a national policy advisor to the Office of the President, among others, Lee has more administrative experience than his opponent. Lee's father, Lee Hung-hsi (\u674e\u9d3b\u79a7), was former President Chen Shui-bian's (\u9673\u6c34\u6241) top national advisor. Having established his support base over the past four years, along with support from the DPP's Chiayi mayor and Chairwoman Tsai, Lee's campaign has garnered great momentum. KMT's Slight Edge in Nantou The election battle in Taiwan's only inland county is not as clear-cut as that in the two southern counties. The electorate is composed of 42-percent blue and 35-percent green supporters. KMT's candidates are leading in polls, but with DPP Chairwoman Tsai's coattails, green candidates are not falling far behind. In the county's legislative District 1, it is the KMT's Ma Wen-chun (\u99ac\u6587\u541b) versus the DPP's Chang Kuo-hsin (\u5f35\u570b\u946b). Their popularity index stands at 57 percent and 43 percent, respectively, according to Exchange of Wisdom. Ma is currently in her legislator post for the second term. Her father, formerly a provincial councilor and Puli Township governor, has rooted influence in local politics. Ma is also a protege of Nantou native and Vice President Wu Den-yih (\u5433\u6566\u7fa9), who has offered a great deal of assistance to KMT candidates in his hometown. The DPP's Chang lacks the support network enjoyed by Ma, but his education credentials \u2014 a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University \u2014 is a boost to his ability to attracting swing votes who make up 20 to 23 percent of the electorate. In the county's District 2, it is the KMT's Hsu Shu-hua (\u8a31\u6dd1\u83ef) against the DPP's Tsai Huang-liang (\u8521\u714c\u746f). Their popularity index stands at 53 percent and 47 percent, respectively. Incumbent legislator Hsu, who had served as Nantou City mayor and councilor, comes from a family with deep political connections. Her father was Nantou City's local representative chairman and the emcee of the local temple. Hsu herself has a wide range of experiences, ranging from Miss Universe contestant to head accountant in her father's business and a liaison between local heavyweights. The DPP's Tsai is not a force to be neglected either. Being elected in the Legislature for five consecutive terms, Tsai has extensive experience in politics. The warhorse enjoys high publicity in the nation due to his frequent political talk show appearances on TV.\n~~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I have quoted this article in full.

Check out this excellent blog post \"Forecasting the 2016 Taiwan Legislative Elections\" (http://www.kharistempleman.com/blog/forecasting-the-2016-taiwan-legislative-elections). I don't know anything about the blog other than this post, but I'll be sure to read more of it later. On method: I like Kharis Templeman's use of Charlie Cook's PVI Index and applying it to Taiwan's legislative contests. It's a good way to establish a base rate. The way I got to a base rate was by using the first method described below: \"I've seen some analyses that start with the results of each district race in 2012 as a baseline, then projects up from those results to estimate how many more seats the DPP will win with a particular partisan swing. To me, the better place to start this kind of forecasting is with the 2012 presidential results in each district, when Tsai Ing-wen ran against Ma Ying-jeou and James Soong. The idea here is, put aside idiosyncrasies such as intra-camp splits and candidate quality, and just pit a generic DPP candidate for the legislature against a generic KMT one in a head-to-head competition. Then who should we expect to win? That's what the presidential results by district tell us. (This measure is roughly analogous to the Partisan Voter Index that the Cook Report does for the US every election cycle.)\" Here is Kharis Templeman's conclusion: \"Summing up: The DPP is probably going to win a majority in the Legislative Yuan\nWhat this exercise demonstrates to me is that the DPP is now a favorite to win an outright majority in the Legislative Yuan. Given what the polls currently show, it's well-positioned to win between 57-62 seats in total, which would be the first time in the democratic era that a party other than the KMT has pulled that off.\" ---------------------------- Comment: Analyzing individual races is still essential. Hopefully, the China Post will soon publish articles on district races in other cities and counties, especially those in Central Taiwan (e.g., Taichung), because I agree with Kharis Templeman that the outcome of the races in New Taipei City (12 seats) and Taichung (8 seats) will determine whether the DPP will gain an outright majority or not."], [128, "2015-12-15T19:16:44Z", [0.3, 0.65, 0.05], ""], [128, "2015-12-15T19:16:13Z", [0.35, 0.55, 0.1], ""], [102, "2015-12-15T17:18:31Z", [0.62, 0.36, 0.02], "https://larswericson.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/monday-night-picks/"], [691, "2015-12-15T13:34:47Z", [0.54, 0.46, 0.0], ""], [601, "2015-12-15T12:22:23Z", [0.53, 0.46, 0.01], "Looks like DPP is solidifying support, thought still a month to go.

Unfortunately, I let my forecast get stale. My revised forecast is based on the party list polls (see below) which is useful for determining, not only the number of party list seats that each party will win, but also the potential swing for each district seat. An average of 8 polls (10/16-11/23) gives the DPP party a 13.3% advantage. Basically, I took the 2012 LY election results and added 9%-11% to the DPP's 2012 totals for each district (with a few exceptions). I then checked the results of the 9-in-1 elections last year to gauge which seats were the most likely to flip if there were a similar pro-DPP wave in January. I also looked at the Frozen Garlic blog for a second opinion. One caveat: I am probably really underestimating how the third parties (especially New Power Party and People First Party) will perform. I intend to revise this forecast again after I look at individual races and evaluate the strength of particular candidates. There are bound to be some KMT candidates who will perform much better than their party, as well as a few third party candidates who could win races or pull votes away from either the KMT or DPP. Likely range of seats that the DPP will win: District seats (73): 39-49\nAboriginal seats (6): 0-1\nList seats (34): 16-20\nRange: 55-69 My forecast: 45 district seats, 0 aboriginal seats, 18 list seats = 63 seats (out of 113) The DPP, by my estimate, could win as much as 69 seats, well over the 57-seat threshold for a majority. The low range begins at 55 seats. So, based on this analysis, my forecast should be 86% (majority), 14% (plurality), 0% (not a plurality). But, as I mentioned, third parties are likely to win more than 2 seats (my current estimate). I haven't determined whether they will hurt the DPP or KMT more, but it wouldn't surprise me if I had to subtract a few seats from the DPP's total. In addition, there will be more than a few KMT and DPP candidates who will run ahead of their party, so looking at individual races is important. There's also a chance the polling could be wrong or a black swan event could upset my calculations.

Discouraged by the party\u2019s bleak outlook, a fair number KMT candidates, incumbents or otherwise, have chosen to run as independents in the upcoming election.

The KMT has a structural advantage in the latter that may help it keep a majority even as it loses the presidency by wide margins. The DPP would certainly pick up extra seats among those allocated proportionally, but the majority of seats are winner-take-all. I'll need to do a district-by-district analysis of those seats at some later date once the slate of candidates and maybe some polls for individual LY races are available. I'm also not ruling out a DPP majority (24%), however unlikely it may seem to those who understand Taiwanese politics, because of the chance that the surprise victories in the 9-in-1 elections last year will be replicated again this year. I think the results of those elections may be a more accurate harbinger of things to come than the presidential polls. Also, be aware that there are a number of third parties running in a coalition with the KMT (Pan-Blue alliance) or the DPP (Pan-Green alliance). So, even if the DPP fails to win a majority, it can still control the LY if allied parties, like the Taiwan Solidarity Union and New Power Party, win enough seats. Same with the KMT (see James Soong's People First Party). Conversely, the TSU and NPP can pull votes away from the DPP, just as the PFP can pull votes from the KMT. If the race is close, this factor may make the difference.
