Therefore, putting a value on volatility is incredibly more difficult as markets diverge from normal \"random walk\"/Brownian motion - like behavior and become unstable. Didier Sornette in his brilliant but arguably out of left field book \"Why Stock Markets Crash\" compared the behavior in these scenarios to balancing a pen on your finger: it is not a matter of if, but when, the pen drops. The binomial path every trading session is not between up/down a certain multiple of sigma, but an increasingly large gain with high probability, versus total collapse. The FT reported on Sep 3rd that Baillie Gifford, Tesla\u2019s biggest independent shareholder, had cut its investment in the electric car maker, generating profits of about $17bn in just eight months after a six-fold surge in the company\u2019s valuation. \n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/e3cb3bc5-a185-4e2a-8ed8-45e48840ef9d This could be likened to the sailor accidentally eating a Tulip bulb in the 1600s. Or maybe not, and we are in for a final \"super spike\"? I find it interesting that if German carmaker Daimler Benz (Mercedes) had not sold its 4% Tesla share in 2014, this would now be worth more than the rest of Daimler. Strange times. But what does the market think? Here are the September options on Tesla for the relevant call strikes. I then use the implied volatility to extend the probability to September 22nd instead of the actual expiration on September 18th. Finally, I modify for my own bearish bias. Note that Tesla closed at $330 but I am correcting the probability for the new pre open price of $353  Sep 18 $400 Call @ 330: $8.66 - implied vol 134% - delta as per Sep 22nd value, $352 market: 35%\nSep 18 $450 Call @ 330: $3.98 - implied vol 141% - delta as per Sep 22nd value, $352 market: 21%\nSep 18 $500 Call @ 330: $2.27 - implied vol 153% - delta as per Sep 22nd value, $352 market: 14%\nSep 18 $550 Call @ 330: $1.41 - implied vol 165% - delta as per Sep 22nd value, $352 market: 10% How to interpret this: the option market implied chance of Tesla being above $550 on Sep 22nd is 10% assuming that the same volatility is valid for Sep 22nd and $352 that worked for Sep 18th and $330, something that exaggerates the probability slightly. The chance of >$500 is 14%, therefore, the chance that Tesla is between $500-$550 is 4% etc.  To account for my bearish bias that the \"blow off top\" is in and the sale of Baillie Gifford was the significant exit event I am using the probabilities of September 18th as valid for September 22nd, and yesterday's closing value instead of the pre open, but otherwise \"listen\" to the market."], [86658, "2020-09-09T10:52:56Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [89013, "2020-09-09T10:14:54Z", [0.49, 0.47, 0.03, 0.01, 0.0], ""], [88766, "2020-09-09T09:51:36Z", [0.72, 0.28, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25400, "2020-09-09T09:47:23Z", [0.9, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [39937, "2020-09-09T08:19:45Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [58028, "2020-09-09T07:46:30Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95062, "2020-09-09T05:14:04Z", [0.42, 0.3, 0.17, 0.07, 0.04], ""], [34815, "2020-09-09T03:48:32Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [95374, "2020-09-09T02:45:13Z", [0.76, 0.11, 0.07, 0.03, 0.03], "Updating with new pricing and after market data.

However, this has been the case for years now, therefore we need to find other ways to put a probability distribution around the stock price. A common way to do it is to use implied option prices and the values that market implies. Option deltas can often be used as an approximate for the probability that the markets imply for the event to occur. We use these values to come up with a probability distribution for the price. There are two main reason why such method could be used and might prove valid: (1) the wisdom of the crowd cannot be underestimated and has proven to be often right, (2) given how detached Tesla is from its fundamental valuation, it is the market that is driving and deciding about the price and not the other way round.
