CISMOA, would allow the United States to supply India with its proprietary encrypted communications equipment and systems, allowing secure peacetime and wartime communication between high-level military leaders on both sides. CISMOA would extend this capability to Indian and U.S. military assets, including aircraft and ships. BECA would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India. India has been resisting to sign these agreements and the resistance is more political than military based:\na) apprehensions like India would lose its military neutrality stand; b) Russia's concern on increasing Indian and US military cooperation especially after the formation of DTTI (Defence Technology and Trade Initiative), a body to remove obstacles to release the technology to India; c) apprehensions regarding India and China relationship which could be affected due to China's visualization of US activity with any South Asian nation as its 'Asia Pivot' Strategy. Other countries who have signed these tri-agreements like France, Germany, Srilanka are still able to have good relations with other countries including economic and military agreements.

Slow decision-making, bureaucratic bottlenecks and complex accounting procedures, much more from the Indian side than the US one, have held up the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) from becoming operational till now.India is also in no tearing hurry to ink the other two \"foundational agreements\", in addition to LEMOA, which are being pushed by the US for over 15 years now. These are the Communications Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA), earlier called the Communication Interoperability and Security Memorandum Agreement (CISMOA), and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA). \"India is keen on further building interoperability between the two forces but it has to follow capacity-building.COMCASA and BECA will take time,\" said an official. Some military officers, on their part, maintain that one effective way of balancing the longterm threat from China, which has increasingly become assertive in the entire Asia-Pacific, is to militarily work closely with the US. But critics contend the \"foundational pacts\" will only lead to a formal military alliance with the US in the years ahead, while adversely impacting the close strategic partnership with Russia as well as needlessly antagonising China. \"A pact like COMCASA also has the potential to compromise our operational security by allowing the US military to snoop on our warships and aircraft,\" said another officer. \nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/seven-months-on-india-us-logistics-pact-suffering-from-bottlenecks/articleshow/57728573.cms"], [368, "2017-03-19T19:17:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31238, "2017-03-18T23:11:25Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.02], ""], [368, "2017-03-18T20:50:02Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-18T15:34:59Z", [0.72, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [1333, "2017-03-17T19:38:08Z", [0.65, 0.25, 0.1], ""], [368, "2017-03-17T17:27:28Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [368, "2017-03-16T20:59:24Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-16T12:33:24Z", [0.72, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [31238, "2017-03-16T10:02:01Z", [0.86, 0.12, 0.02], ""], [31238, "2017-03-16T10:00:44Z", [0.83, 0.15, 0.02], ""], [28091, "2017-03-16T01:29:24Z", [0.75, 0.2, 0.05], ""], [368, "2017-03-16T00:40:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [31678, "2017-03-15T21:44:09Z", [0.72, 0.21, 0.07], ""], [368, "2017-03-14T18:04:14Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-03-14T17:38:28Z", [0.72, 0.24, 0.04], ""], [29054, "2017-03-14T16:50:54Z", [0.75, 0.25, 0.0], "Tillerson in his trip to the east is not stopping in Delhi, and that is a huge mistake.
