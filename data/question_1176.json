This implies being seen to take a tougher stance with Kurdish groups, ie PKK.  - I estimate a probability of 30% in the next year for a \"major event\" along the lines of Cizre that includes civilian casualties. However 1,000 civilians is significantly more than recent violent events in Turkey. To compare, ~250 civilians nationwide in the 2016 coup \"attempt\", ~150 likely civilians in Feb 2016 in Cizre, ~2,000 \"PKK rebels\" claimed in 3 months of urban warfare in 2015 (not that PKK fighters are counted as civilians; but given the tactics, we could assume a certain portion were misidentified). Another list of massacres since independence is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Turkey#Republic_of_Turkey_(1923%E2%80%93present) .  - I estimate a probability of 2% (once in fifty years) that such an event would kill >1,000 civilians.

Inside view: \n- From EWP: \"Ranked eighth for risk in 2018\u201319, Turkey has been in the top 15 in each of our past three annual assessments. The failed coup attempt in 2016 caused Turkey to rise in our rankings. Other risk factors include a lack of freedom of movement for men, the country\u2019s anocratic regime type, a large population, a history of mass killing, and the ongoing armed conflict between the government and Kurdish rebels. Turkey\u2019s infant mortality rate and ethnic fractionalization are substantially lower than average; Turkey\u2019s risk estimate would be even higher if those variables were at the global mean.\" [1]\n- the most obvious candidate seems to be the ongoing Turkish-Kurdic conflict [2]. However, the civilian death toll has been small: 124 since 2015 [2]. Given Turkey's NATO membership, I'd be very surprised about an escalation that resulted in the Turkish armed forces deliberately killing over 1,000 civilians. The PKK also does not seem to target civilians deliberately.\n- that leaves unknown unknowns like a civil war resulting from a coup or similar. This seems a very remote possibility. Overall judgment:\n- EWP seems too high here. My informed gut judgment is 1%.
