Indeed, to keep public budgets stable, the Russian government is forced to raise taxes and extend the retirement age in the years to come. As long as the standard of living was rising, the vast majority of Russian refrained from active participation in politics. But then from 2014 to 2018, real incomes fell for five years running. Kremlin could now be facing a crisis of legitimacy \u2013 and that in a phase of uncertainty about a possible shift of power after Putin\u2019s last term of office (2018\u20132024). Putin has said he wants to raise living standards and improve social care in Russia, and a cut to military spending is one way to make funds available for such projects this.\nFurther, the reform proposed by the former Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin recommends increasing spending on infrastructure, education, and health care, and decreasing spending on defense, security, and a number of subsidies.\nAgainst this backdrop, Kremlin will less likely reduce its defense budget since the Russian arms industry employs around two million workers, whose support for the Kremlin regime is essential. Also, cutting the defense budget contradicts the Kremlin\u2019s current political priorities by glorifying the success of the military buildup. \nAs it concerns Syria and Ukraine: According to estimates, the direct costs of Russian military operations in Syria and Ukraine make up just a few percents of the Russian defense budget, which amounted to around \u20ac43.3 billion in 2017. The necessary expenditures could thus be covered entirely through reallocations, for instance from the budget for military exercises, without any added burden on the budget.\nAgain, it is less likely that Kremlin will  cut DB or even less likely that it will increase DB beyond 4.4%.

This notwithstanding, what does a 13% increase tell us about possible military spending in 2019?  In 2018, Russia spent 3.85 trillion roubles on military spending [3]. If that rose by 13% this year it would equal 4.3 trillion.

This is very simple analysis is meant to simply say: what does existing data tell us about the answer to the question.

This, however, does not necessarily suggest the long term degradation of Russia military power.  Russia's military relies on conscripts, which means that outside of the money needed to provide initial training, it does not necessarily need to devote as much money to funding year round readiness, or invest as heavily in training like its Western competitors with more professional armed services.  Instead, it devotes more of its defense budget to R&D, procurement, and modernization.  While all of these initiatives have significant up front expenses, their true costs can be spread out over a longer time horizon.  This helps Russia keep its military spending low.  Finally, Russia is undoubtedly itching to find a way to withdraw its military forces from Syria.  Although the intervention has been hugely successful for Putin, and it has considerably raised his domestic and international standing, he knows that once events \"go South\" (i.e. Russian death toll increases in country) these gains will erode.

It is worth noting, however, that SIPR's definition of \"military spending\" is more expansive than the federal definition for \"national defense\", with SIPRI numbers consistently higher than \"national defense\" figures with the difference in the order of hundreds of billions of roubles. For example, SIPRI's definition includes spending for paramilitary forces and military pension payments  [2], which are not covered by the federal government definition of \"national defense\". This paper [3, pages 17 and 23] provides a disambiguation of the terms. To estimate 2019 \"military spending\" I took \"national defense\" expenditure budgeted for 2019 (2.8 trillion roubles) and added a residual accounting for additional expenditures not counted under \"national defense\". This residual was estimated as the average difference between \"national defense\" spending and SIPRI military spending in 2016 and 2017. This leads to an estimate of 3.77 trillion roubles in 2019.  Russia's GDP (expressed in current roubles, consistent with SIPRI's numbers) is projected to be 106 trillion roubles in 2019 by the IMF (projection as of October 2018) [4] This suggests military spending equal to 3.6% of GDP. It is important to account for potential budgetary adjustments as budgets are revised every year. For example, Russia increased its 2018 budget by 8% [5] compared to the 2017-2019 budget I quoted. An impetus for further increases in military spending could, for example, come from the recent rise in the oil price. The aforementioned 2017-2019 budget is based on a price of $40. The current price is above $80. Price levels in 2019 are highly uncertain but it's very likely that the price will stay far above $40. The EIA assumes the oil price will stay near its current levels in 2019 [6]. Still, there might be reasons for spending to go down rather than up. Russia may want to spend more of its budget domestically, particularly given that Putin's popularity has fallen as indicated by polls by two different organizations, [7], partially in the wake of a deeply unpopular rise in the retirement ages. Recent announcements by Putin do point toward a lowering of military spending in 2018 and 2019 [8]. While the 2018 budget was revised by 8%, I assume that 95% of the variation in military spending compared to the 2017-2019 budget will be within 25% (particularly as this term includes uncertainty in \"national defense\" spending and the residual discussed above). A 25% upward revision to the 2019 figure estimated above would result in military spending equal to 4.7 trillion, or 4.5% of IMF's GDP estimate. It bears mentioning that GDP and military spending adjustments are not independent. Instead, there is probably some correlation. This correlation reduces the variability that we can expect from military spending expressed as a % of GDP, leading me to lower the 4.9%>X>4.4% chances slightly (from ~5% to 3%). Finally, I account for \"unknown unknowns\" by raising the probability of 4.9%>X>4.4% by 6 % points. Levels at or above 4.9% seem very unlikely from a historical standpoint. Spending as a % of GDP has been at 4.9% or above only 4 times out of the last 26 years, with an average around 4% (on the basis of SIPRI data).

(\u201cVedomosti\u201d got acquainted with a copy of the document; its authenticity was confirmed by a federal official). So, in 2019, there is a reduction in expenditures under the section \u201cNational Defense\u201d (includes the overwhelming part of defense expenditures) by 118 billion rubles, in 2020 an increase of 105 billion compared to 2019, and in 2021 - An increase of 141 billion compared with 2020. According to a person close to the Ministry of Defense, most likely, as in the past year, the ministry will raise the issue of increasing allocations in the range of 100\u2013200 billion rubles. and, probably, this request will be partially satisfied. In this case, there will be no nominal reduction in defense spending, but in fact, taking into account inflation, they will be reduced. It is also not known how planned for 2020\u20132021. the increase in spending will be able to offset inflation, the source said. Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov said on Tuesday after a meeting of the military-industrial commission in Patriot Park that the expenses on the main section of the defense budget - on the purchase and development of weapons - will be stable in the coming years. He also said that at the meeting it was decided to start the development of a new state armament program (LG) from 2023 to 2033, which will replace the current LG from 2018 to 2027 (LG-2027). Oleg Achkasov, deputy director of the 46th research institute of the Ministry of Defense, said in February in the program \u201cMilitary Acceptance\u201d on Zvezda TV channel that the Defense Ministry proposes to develop a new LGU with a deadline from 2021 to 2030, to return to the previous five-year cycle of changing LGG, coinciding with the calendar decade (in 2016\u20132017, the new GWP was not accepted due to macroeconomic instability). According to Konstantin Makienko, an expert at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, this means that during the first four years of the HPV-2027, no more than 6 trillion rubles will be spent on the purchase, development and repair of weapons. - the cost of these goals is on average half the cost of the section \"National Defense\". This will be less than a third of the 10-year spending on the HPV-2027, which is planned at a rate of 19 trillion rubles. Thus, the trend of the previous LG will continue, when most of the expenditures were allocated to the second five-year program, while in fact the expenditures were tens of percent lower than the plan. At the same time, notes Makienko, the HPV-2027 will be financed with even more uniformly than with the previous HPV-2020, which entered into force in 2011. that during the first four years of the HPV-2027, no more than 6 trillion rubles will be spent on the purchase, development and repair of weapons. - the cost of these goals is on average half the cost of the section \"National Defense\".

As for the expenses of other law enforcement agencies, most of all, according to the three-year budget bill, from 2018 to 2021, the costs for the prosecutor's office and the Investigation Committee will increase (by about 18%), while for the rest of the agencies (FSB, MIA, FSIN, etc. .) expenses for this period will increase within 5-10% and may even in some cases actually decrease due to inflation. The interlocutor in the prosecutor's office suggested that this was due to the need to raise wages in the TFR, recently lagged behind other security officials. At the same time, the overall stability of spending indirectly confirms that global reforms like the creation in 2016 of the Rosguards are not expected, he says.\nhttps://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2018/09/20/781554-rashodi-na-oboronu"], [19801, "2018-10-08T00:39:50Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "1.

Russia is still 4th largest military spender, with spending on the same level as 2014. \nAccording to SIPRI, the pattern of military spending over the past 10 years can be correlated with the rise and fall of oil prices. Armed conflict is also a driver, obviously. With increasing oil prices, will this mean an increase in russian expenditure (both relative and absolute) or will military spending be kept at same level, but there will be a relative decrease due to rising GDP?  According to recent news by the Economist, Putin set out the goals for his next six-year term earlier this year. Putins want more of everything, including an increase in GDP per head of 50% (yeah right). The prospects of Russia changing funding from military to health care spending seems modest, considering powerful security and defence lobbies. Fun fact, according to the Economist: 2011 finances minister was dismissed for criticising expansion in defence funding. Also, tense international relations points towards the armed forces remaining a priority. The defence industry is also a major employer and manufacturing sector. According to the Economist, there are indications that defense spending is past its peak (see last years cut). A source of uncertainty is US sanctions, and how they may reduce Russian exports. This can lead the Russian government to expande state purchase of equipemnt to provide support to defence manufactureres. Based on this I'll go with no or small cuts in military spending, but increased GDP due to increasing oil price will keep the expenditure as % of GDP most likely less than 5.  https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/sipri_fs_1805_milex_2017.pdf\nhttps://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Trends-world-military-expenditure-2016.pdf\nhttp://visuals.sipri.org/\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/20/c_137050956.htm HT @Raahul_Kumar\nhttp://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=997171083&Country=Russia&topic=Economy"], [38616, "2018-10-06T15:56:43Z", [0.7, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Pondering which base rate to use.

One more link.\nhttp://cast.ru/eng/comments/russia-s-defense-budget-down-but-not-out.html Finally, calculating 2017 defense spend as % of GDP is not exactly trivial - the SIPRI figures are in rubles but I can only find GDP in USD. The SIPRI data is here and puts 2017 defense spending at 3.8687 trillion rubles. Russian nominal GDP is at $1.579 trillion. If we use the wikipedia exchange rate (.018 = 55.56 RUB/USD) that gets us exactly 4.41%, but the average daily exchange rate for 2017 looks more like 57-58, which would put it below 4.4%.

This is higher than the often-reported expenditure per the Russian budget headings, which is why despite widely reported cuts (e.g. figs here https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-14/russia-s-military-is-leaner-but-meaner) the actual effect on SIPRI reported expenditure may not be so sharp.  Constant post-2011 upwards trend according to SIPRI with incremental jumps c. 0.3% (although marginally quicker since RUB devaluation in 14/15). So if current patterns hold 2019 will fall between 6.5% GDP and 5.9% of GDP (0.4 -0.2pa).   However, I don\u2019t expect the pattern to hold. Russia is well above post-CW averages for expenditure and also above global averages \u2013 inc. above US & China. Reversion to mean is likely to take effect as current rate seems unsustainable. Budget pressures & current forecasts suggest cuts. 2016 expenditure seems to include an early debt wipe out, so that would also be artificially high if so \u2013 in fact, it probably masks underlying cuts - see Mark Galeotti for the ECFR here: https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_the_truth_about_russias_defence_budget_7255\nn.b the percentages don\u2019t match SIPRI due to different definitions of MilEx.  Military expenditure doubles with a domestic political element \u2013 jobs. As Galeotti points out cities like Nizhny Tagil are Putin\u2019s heartland, and Russia also earns from military exports. There is every incentive not to make swingeing cuts if avoidable. If OPEC Vienna agreement co-operation holds & oil stays at its higher recent rates GDP should increase more quickly (current EIU forecasts are for raises of 1.9% in 2018) which would potentially mean that the percentage share could fall while holding absolute rates. Prices are currently above $40/bbl, which is above MOF Budget policy assumptions (according to a March 2017 paper by Julian Cooper at Birmingham University CREES, available from researchgate.net) so that might help soften the blow to the defence budget.  As long as the Syrians don't need urgent support again and nothing else immediately develops, domestic non-military expenditure probably needs to be prioritised. Therefore, I am betting that the rates will ease back under 5%, especially if GDP returns to growth. Could go further than that.

Need to pay personnel, to replace equipments, etc. \nRussia also needs to modernize their weapons too. Recent missile strike in Syria by USA-Britain-France shows that Russia has no shield. Of course, they may not equip Bashar Al Assad with the latest technology, but I would think they would use the opportunity to test out their equipment effectiveness, instead of wait for the real war on Russian soil to find out. The USA has confidence of their missile defense system by helping Israel develop its Iron Dome Missile Defense system. (Caveat, the Iranian missiles are not USA smart missiles, so Iron Dome may not as effective against Tomahawk missiles). My point is that it is likely Russia and China will have to accelerate their missile defense research.  Russian economy isn't in very good shape. By picking up fight with USA over Syria, by overly active with cyber warfare, by poisoning people on UK soil, Russia becomes more and more isolated. Although oil price is coming back up, throwing a lifeline to Russian budget, the fact that USA has lifted its ban on exporting oil and gas, and has become energy independent, making Western Europe less dependent on Russian oil and gas. Current sanction on Rusal (aluminum company), may hit Russia economy, due to its dependency on natural resource export.

At the same time, a significant proportion of the \u201csecret expenses\u201d most likely does not go to military purposes but simply remains in someone\u2019s pocket.\nIn contrast, military spending rose from 2 trillion, 141 billion in 2013 to 3.775 trillion in 2016. In 2017 it fell to 2.778 trillion, and it will decline further in 2018 to 2.771 trillion, but will grow again afterward, to 2.808 trillion in 2020. It should be borne in mind that the actual military spending in Russia is much higher than the planned figures. Traditionally, additional budget revenues, if any, are allocated to this sector. Moreover, some military expenditures are concealed under other civilian items, primarily under the \u201cnational economy.\u201d Police spending rose from 1 trillion, 487 billion in 2013 to 1.898 trillion in 2016, 1.977 trillion in 2017, 2.108 trillion in 2018, and 2.140 trillion in 2020. The share of concealed budget expenditures in 2013 amounted to 13.8 percent of the total expenditure and increased to 18.6 percent in 2017, with a planned increase to 20.1 percent of the budget in 2020. These are absolutely bizarre figures that cannot withstand any comparison with the secret parts of budgets in developed economies. \"\nWho knows?\nHe has big projects in pipeline"], [41922, "2018-04-18T23:17:56Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.0], ""], [172, "2018-04-18T21:22:47Z", [0.0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0], "Lots of news re decrease but believe it is minimal...\nhttp://www.kennan-russiafile.org/2017/12/08/two-lean-years-russias-budget-for-2018-2020/"], [15196, "2018-04-18T17:34:49Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1], ""]]}
