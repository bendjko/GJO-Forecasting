This was not sloppiness or negligence.\u00a0 This was deliberate.\u00a0 It did not involve a handful of overzealous FBI agents.\u00a0 It involved some of the most powerful people in the republic. PREDICTION #2 Implicated in the plot uncovered by Durham\u2019s investigation will be senior individuals within Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for the Presidency and senior officials in both the US law enforcement and intelligence communities. They will be found to have formed a criminal conspiracy. PREDICTION #3 Durham\u2019s report will make clear that once the original plot failed, and Donald Trump won the election, the focus of the plot changed.\u00a0 It moved from being an effort to block President Trump\u2019s election to one which had the goal of sabotaging his presidency and removing him from office.\u00a0 It became the first coup attempt in U.S. history. The key individuals involved knew the purpose of the conspiracy and acted with full knowledge of its criminality. PREDICTION #4 It will become clear that the plotters working against the President were motivated not simply by a desire for personal or political gain, but also by an intense arrogance and a general contempt for the American people.\u00a0 As evidenced in so many of the interviews given by individuals like Mr. Brennan and Mr. Comey, it will be revealed that the \u201ccoup plotters\u201d were offended by Mr. Trump and considered him an illegitimate president whom they had a \u201cduty\u201d to remove from office. PREDICTION #5 Not all of the individuals named in Durham\u2019s report will be former government officials.\u00a0 Serving officials, some of them at very senior levels, will be found to have been part of the conspiracy to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office.\u00a0 Individuals who are currently serving in key positions in this administration will be among those proven to be involved in the plot. PREDICTION #6 The conspiracy to sabotage the Trump campaign will be found to have originated months before the initiation of the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.\u00a0\u00a0The nerve center of the conspiracy will be identified inside the Central Intelligence Agency\u00a0in a \u201ccounterintelligence task force\u201d formed at the direction of CIA Director John Brennan.\u00a0 Targeting of the Trump campaign by intelligence sources will be substantiated. PREDICTION #7 The plot will be found to be ongoing.\u00a0 Current efforts to destabilize this administration will be revealed.\u00a0\u00a0This is not yet over. PREDICTION #8 Foreign intelligence agencies will be found to have participated in the plot to keep Donald Trump from winning the presidency.\u00a0 The agencies in question will include some that are among our closest allies. PREDICTION #9 There will be indictments.\u00a0 They will be significant, and they will be handed down against individuals who were and perhaps still are serving at the highest levels of the federal bureaucracy.\u00a0 As indictments emerge, some of the individuals involved in this plot will begin to cut deals in exchange for leniency in sentencing.

Mark Meadows, R.-N.C., that he would not seek re-election in 2020, speculation was sparked that the four-term conservative lawmaker would be the next White House chief of staff. Amid growing reports that President Donald Trump is dissatisfied with his current chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, several sources close to the White House say he would prefer the more activist Meadows \u2014 a fierce Trump loyalist and former chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. A builder and developer (like Trump), Meadows, 60, made little secret of his desire to leave Congress and take over the White House staff in January when then-chief of staff John Kelly resigned. The job went instead to Mulvaney, who has served for nearly a year on an \"acting\" basis while still officially holding the position of director of the Office of Management and Budget. Other close Trump-watchers told Newsmax that it would be unwise for the president to appoint his fourth chief of staff in as many years and that he might be smarter to consider naming Meadows if he is re-elected next year. Others take a different view of Meadows becoming chief of staff. Chris Whipple, author of the best-selling book \"The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency,\" told us: \"Without singling anyone out by name, I would simply say the last thing Trump needs is another sycophant as White House chief of staff.\"\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  11 days to go but all it would take for Mulvaney as CoS to be history is about 60 seconds on Twitter.

DJT may perceive MM's willingness to put himself into deep legal debt by refusing to testify as an act of loyalty that should be rewarded. However, it's possible that the House might pass Articles of Impeachment by about Dec 12th, 18 days before this question closes. How will DJT react to being impeached?

The main arguments in support of NOT firing MM would be to reward his loyalty, not admit to any \"imperfection\", and to prevent MM from becoming a loose canon.

OCTOBER 18, 2019\nMick Mulvaney's job was in danger even before his disastrous press conference yesterday, and his equally disastrous attempt to walk that performance back. The fumble could not have been more poorly timed: According to multiple current and former White House officials, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay private conversations, Trump has been steadily souring on Mulvaney for weeks.\n. . .\nThe president has polled confidants about whether Mulvaney is up to the job, blaming him for leaks and negative news coverage, and considering whether he should find someone else to run the West Wing. It might stand to reason, then, that with Trump\u2019s growing frustrations with Mulvaney\u2014coupled with a performance yesterday that could put Trump in greater legal jeopardy than ever before\u2014Mulvaney\u2019s days as acting chief of staff are numbered. Yesterday\u2019s press conference was significant not just for Mulvaney\u2019s revelations about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. It also laid bare just how key a role Mulvaney has played in those dealings. Mulvaney admitted, for example, that Trump had spoken to him directly about an issue at the heart of Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry: withholding aid to Ukraine partly because Trump wanted an investigation into a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server. Trump was not happy\u2014and neither were his most prominent allies. The shock of Mulvaney\u2019s admission was only compounded by the flippancy with which he delivered it: For those troubled by it, he told reporters, \u201cget over it.\u201d Mulvaney later walked the claim back, but even in the eyes of the president\u2019s closest confidants, the damage was done. For a White House staffer, there is perhaps no worse place to be than in Sean Hannity\u2019s crosshairs, and that\u2019s where Mulvaney found himself yesterday, after undercutting the administration\u2019s talking points on impeachment in a way that not even a Trump-loving Fox News host could spin. Shortly after the press conference, Hannity excoriated the acting chief on his radio show: \u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about?\u201d Hannity scoffed. \u201cI just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do. I don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d Nevertheless, in the course of combusting the White House\u2019s narrative on impeachment, Mulvaney unwittingly demonstrated why, at this fraught moment in Trump\u2019s presidency, he may be untouchable: Should Trump fire him and leave him aggrieved, Mulvaney could prove a damaging witness in Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation. A former White House official said Trump \u201cwill be feeling the pain of having pushed out [former National Security Adviser John] Bolton at a very inopportune time. He won\u2019t make the same mistake with Mulvaney, however frustrated he may be with him. Now, their interests are aligned. They sink or swim together.\u201d It\u2019s a line of thinking that has come to permeate the West Wing, and it marks a significant shift in how Trump is beginning to view his relationship with his staffers. For the past two and a half years, the White House has operated like a radio perpetually set on scan, with Trump sampling staffer after staffer in search of those whose rhythms match his own. Indeed, as Mulvaney told us earlier this year, it\u2019s made for a West Wing whose atmosphere is dictated by one particular maxim: \u201cHe could fire any of us tomorrow.\u201d With the backdrop of impeachment, however, some White House staffers could feel more secure in their jobs than even their boss\u2014and that\u2019s perhaps especially true of Mulvaney. As Democrats move forward in their investigation, they\u2019re looking for star witnesses, those officials in Trump\u2019s inner circle who could speak authoritatively as to whether Trump pressured a foreign power to open investigations into both the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden. And should Trump discard an adviser in his preferred manner\u2014hastily announce the news on Twitter, then trash the person\u2019s reputation\u2014he or she may decide to become said star witness.\n. . .\nBolton\u2019s uncertain loyalty in this pivotal moment has convinced many of Trump\u2019s allies that, eager as the president may be to oust him, Mulvaney is better kept inside of the White House. According to the current and former White House officials and others close to the president, people have been urging Trump to hold his acting chief in place, telling him that the risk of an aggrieved ex-official on the outside far outweighs any annoyances Trump may have with him. As President Lyndon Johnson famously said about then\u2013FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, it\u2019s better to keep him inside the tent \u201cpissing out\u201d than the opposite. \u201cThe president always fears that people he either gets rid of or resigns will turn out to be a press liability,\u201d one person close to the White House told us. \u201cBut, look, if you treat people like crap, you shouldn\u2019t expect loyalty.\u201d According to legal experts, by keeping Mulvaney in place, Trump can make a stronger case that Mulvaney is immune from having to testify about conversations with the president. \u201cIt becomes more difficult to control those who are no longer part of the executive branch,\u201d Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor, told us. This is not to say, of course, that Trumpworld was quick to move on from Mulvaney\u2019s disastrous briefing-room appearance. One of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, Jay Sekulow, released a terse statement after Mulvaney\u2019s press conference, saying that Trump\u2019s legal team \u201cwas not involved\u201d in the briefing. However, the fact that Mulvaney still holds his job\u2014in spite of the torrent of criticism inside and outside the White House\u2014could underscore just how much impeachment has come to scramble the regular rhythms of this presidency. Gone, perhaps, are the days when Trump would give little thought to axing a senior official. Because while tell-all books come and go\u2014promising a juicy anecdote here, a gossipy passage there\u2014the impeachment inquiry is in motion. Which means the risk of ushering his staff into the arms of Democratic investigators is one that Trump may become less and less inclined to take. There was a curious moment on Wednesday in the Oval Office, when Trump\u2019s opinion of Bolton suddenly seemed to brighten. No longer did Trump want to dwell on his disagreements with Bolton or how Bolton had wrongly supported the Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq. \u201cI actually got along with him pretty well. It just didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Trump told reporters during a meeting with his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella. It was as though Trump was telegraphing an understanding of the stakes, in this moment, of having his former national security adviser as an enemy. And earlier today, when he brushed off reporters\u2019 questions about Mulvaney\u2019s press conference, saying simply, \u201cI think he clarified it,\u201d Trump seemed to communicate another message of self-awareness: that he, more than ever, needs Mulvaney as a friend.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I can believe that Mulvaney knows a lot!

Bolton, the former national security adviser. Mr. Mulvaney retreated only hours after a lawyer for Mr. Bolton and his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, went to court arguing that his clients wanted nothing to do with the staff chief because they had vastly different interests. In withdrawing his motion, Mr. Mulvaney indicated that he would now press his own lawsuit to determine whether to comply with a subpoena to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. But it left him at odds with the president, who has ordered his team not to cooperate with the House, an order Mr. Mulvaney has essentially refused to accept as other administration officials have until he receives separate guidance from a judge. Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s lawyers emphasized that he was not trying to oppose Mr. Trump, maintaining that he was actually trying to sue House Democrats, and an administration official who insisted on anonymity said there was \u201cno distance\u201d between the president and his chief of staff. Still, Mr. Mulvaney hired his own lawyer instead of relying on the White House counsel, and he consciously made clear that he was open to testifying if left to his own devices. The situation underscored the longstanding enmity between Mr. Mulvaney and the counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who have repeatedly been at odds throughout the impeachment inquiry, according to four administration officials briefed on the events. Mr. Mulvaney, who has been left with an \u201cacting\u201d title for more than 10 months and therefore insecure in his position, is said to see Mr. Cipollone as angling for his job as chief of staff. People close to Mr. Cipollone deny that and say he is not interested, although they acknowledged that there were previous discussions with Mr. Trump about such a shift. Hoping to bolster his own place in the White House, Mr. Mulvaney has recommended to Mr. Trump that he hire Mark Paoletta, the general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget, where Mr. Mulvaney is still technically the director, according to people familiar with the maneuvering. Mr. Paoletta would not displace Mr. Cipollone but would give Mr. Mulvaney an ally on the legal team as the impeachment battle plays out. Another person familiar with the latest moves said that Mr. Paoletta was considered, but that West Wing officials decided they were pleased with the hiring of Pam Bondi, a former attorney general of Florida, and Tony Sayegh, a Republican strategist, both of whom began full time this week. The latest personnel struggle echoed an attempt by Mr. Mulvaney several weeks ago to hire former Representative Trey Gowdy, a fellow South Carolina Republican, to join the president\u2019s legal team. Mr. Cipollone and others were said to take issue with the idea, concerned it was an effort by Mr. Mulvaney to run his own legal team. Mr. Cipollone told allies he had no such concerns, but eventually, Mr. Gowdy bowed out, facing an issue with a ban on former House members lobbying Congress. Despite his own tenuous job status, Mr. Mulvaney has privately told associates in recent days that there is no easy way for Mr. Trump to fire him in the midst of the impeachment fight, the implication being that he knows too much about the president\u2019s pressure campaign to force Ukraine to provide incriminating information about Democrats. The court fight between Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton on Monday brought their long-running feud into the open. Mr. Mulvaney was among those facilitating the Ukraine effort, while Mr. Bolton was among those objecting to it. At one point, according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Bolton declared that he wanted no part of the \u201cdrug deal\u201d Mr. Mulvaney was cooking up, as the then national security adviser characterized the pressure campaign. . . . \n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  Mulvaney is at odds with Pompeo, Bolton, Kupperman, Cipollone, and Barr.

On the other hand, Trump has no loyalty to others, unless there is something in it for him,  and he still does not seem to like or have much faith in Mulvaney's ability.

He is much less likely to be fired now.   Specifically, there are four possible reasons why he did it:  1)  He felt pangs of  conscious and decided to challenge Trump. 2) He wanted to avoid a possible jail sentence.  3) He wanted to delay the inevitable,   4) Or,  he and Trump want a judicial ruling finding immunity really exists in this context, and they think this is the best way to get it.     The idea that Mulvaney has a conscious is laughable given his history, and Trump would probably have fired him already.  There is little chance he will go to jail, given no one else has and AG Barr will not likely prosecute anyone for refusing to testify.   The lawsuit would delay his testifying only if he planned on eventually obeying the subpoena, but that is not likely.  Trump wants a judicial finding that immunity is not something he and his lawyers just made up.  Actually, it is not, but the press reports suggests the courts have never recognized it.   The best way to have a court recognize immunity would be to 1) have the person with the best justification for it file a lawsuit and 2) present arguments favorable to the president in that lawsuit.  Mulvaney's attempt to intervene in the lawsuit filed by Bolton and Kupperman did just that.  If Mulvaney had succeeded in joining Bolton and Kupperman's lawsuit, it could have changed the nature of the lawsuit entirely.   Bolton at least seems to want to tell his story and may present legal arguments suggesting immunity is  nonsense.   Mulvaney would then have presented legal arguments and authorities  that no one might have presented in his absence.  Mulvaney's lawyers might have been able to tilt the filed toward the president.  Any lawyer wanting to litigate immunity would want to do it with the  person most likely to win--and that is Mulvaney.    Mulvaney is more likely to get the immunity because he is a current, not former, member of the White House staff, unlike Bolton and Kupperman.  He also has information related to the internal workings of the White House.  A White House chief of staff normally spends a lot of time pondering with the president alternative courses of action.  A court will likely feel that a president needs to do this in private so he can freely formulate policy on a vary wide variety of issues.  Some of the things considered could be strictly political and/or some options could be extremely embarrassing if revealed.   Yet, in order to thoroughly evaluate a possible course of action, considering unpopular options may have to be discussed.  Privacy is essential for this to occur. It is kind of like a lawyer's impressions of his client's case--which are never discoverable.   The lawyer needs to know he can discuss his client's case with co-counsel without the opposition knowing what they discussed.    Thus,  Mulvaney should have a much better argument for immunity than the Bolton and Kupperman who are lower down the food chain and may not have had the same contact with the president.   If this is the reason why Mulvaney filed a lawsuit, it would not be the first time.  Paul Manafort after pleading guilty (to additional counts after conviction on some counts agreed to cooperate with Meuller and the grand jury investigating Trump.  Manafort did not cooperate but continued to lie.  He  listened to all the questions I suspected he relayed the questions back to the Trump team.  The sentencing judge said Manafort continued to lie in hopes of getting a pardon. \n\nPresident Trump does not fire those who, like Kelly Anne Conway, defend him no matter what.     All Mulvaney's past sins could be forgiven if he won and established immunity as a legal doctrine--making Trump and any other president almost a dictator.  Also, if immunity is found, the courts may find it exists only for current, not former, staff members.  So, I think Mulvaney's chances of staying improved greatly with this lawsuit.

The prevailing wisdom is that previous COSs did not last long and overall the Trump's administration is characterized by fast turnover of staff. Hence, MM should also not last long. In real life though, fast turnover at the beginning can be explained by screening new hires until you find a \"good fit\". Most probably, the previous COSs did not fit the employer's (DJT) vision of his COS. It looks MM fits perfectly DJT's style and without other considerations - impeachment proceedings - we would expect MM serve in this capacity for quite a while. When DJT came to WH, it took him a while to get rid of \"babysitters\" and finally settle in his usual MO. 2 COSs is not representative enough and I'd rather use excellent model by @AABoyles for COS's survival probability (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/918845), which uses all COSs after WWIII. At this time his model gives MM just around 6% percentage points to cease to be COS in the question timeframe. The compounding factor is impeachment. And again it looks the majority considers that as an aggravating factor for MM, increasing his chances to lose his position. What history tells us? Neither Richard Nixon, nor Bill Clinton changed their COSs during long impeachment proceedings - Alexander Haig and Jon Podesta, respectfully. Yes, MM didn\u2019t say \u201cNo!\u201d to DJT when he was supposed to by conventional wisdom, but that was expected of MM by DJT. And the lack of incoherent response on impeachment at the beginning blamed on MM is also well within DJT\u2019s expectations.\n\nCan DJT blame mishaps \u2013  e.g. incoming troubles for Giuliani on MM and throw the latter under the bus? Most probably not \u2013 easier to blame everything on Giuliani, a person without official status than on MM, who is too close to the President. I believe Giuliani\u2019s scapegoating will be in order. Can Giuliani sink MM - who wants to go down as a rogue actor alone? Maybe, but not in a timeframe we have - so far Giuliani resisted to testify at all.  So, impeachment per se IMHO significantly decreases, practically eliminates chances of MM losing his position. Of course, there is a possibility that DJT would be impeached and MM loses his position along with Trump losing his. We may boldly assign probability of this to 0 as it is practically impossible in the Senate at this time AND the time is short for that - just two months and the House of representatives is just starting with testimonies. The rest (death, illness etc.) was covered by @Anneinak here (https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/819695). Of course, it is just my personal assessment and I can be mistaken.

That events that are the result of large groups take forever/don't happen overnight, like mega-trade deals, but events that can come about as the result of the decisions of one or a few people can happen with little or no notice.  Because MM is only an \"acting\" CoS, DJT can fire him in a blink, or he can quit equally precipitously.    Questions involving few \"deciders\" are generally more volatile, then. I've thought that MM wouldn't quit.  When he took the job he sold himself to DJT as a known entity looking for job stability, but sometimes legal heat gets so high that people have to quit their jobs to devote themselves full-time to their legal defense.  MM seems to have gotten himself into a legal mess the other day with his contradictory statements re quid pro quo in the July 25th phone call between DJT & Zelensky.  He may find his life consumed with hearings. At the same time, I thought DJT would not fire him because of the \"optics\" of it, since DJT has already had so much turn-over in his cabinet & staff.

I said DJT wouldn't fire him for his role in the Ukraine deal  because DJT would have to first admit that there was something wrong with it.

The sources say the President is not upset with Mulvaney for the White House releasing the summary of his July 25 call with Ukraine's leader or the whistleblower complaint because he had been convinced that it was necessary. What Trump and other aides are frustrated with, according to the sources, is that Mulvaney did not have a strategy for defending and explaining the contents of those documents as soon as they were publicly released. One of the sources says it's not just the President, but also widespread frustration in the White House about the lack of a response plan to deal with the fallout after the release of the whistleblower complaint ignited more controversy surrounding the President. The sources say Mulvaney is taking the heat for that. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Saturday in a statement, \"This story is manufactured palace intrigue. \"The fact is that President Trump and this Administration have done nothing wrong,\" the statement continued. \"Why would we need to implement a strategy to explain the contents of a document we willingly released? Sounds to me like more anonymous troublemakers working to stir the pot for their own selfish reasons.\" The feeling among some working to contain the controversy is that some aides who pushed for a response felt Mulvaney was getting in the way of allowing it. The frustration over a lack of a response plan poured over into a series of meetings at the White House Friday between the President and top aides, including his personal counsel and White House lawyers, to figure out a strategy moving forward. Sources caution that despite Mulvaney not being in a good place right now, the President may not be eager to fire Mulvaney anytime soon given the amount of tumult, even for a White House used to that. Mulvaney allies are dismissing the notion that he is in trouble. \"That literally has no basis in reality,\" said John Czwartacki, a senior adviser to Mulvaney.\n. . . \nThe reporting about Mulvaney comes weeks after Trump abruptly fired his then-national security adviser John Bolton. Trump's administration has been marked by a series of exits by high-ranking officials, and the President has already cycled through two White House chiefs of staff. Mulvaney has not lost the \"acting\" part of his title since stepping into the role after John Kelly left the post at the end of last year. The conservative former South Carolina congressman became the third chief of staff in less than two years to take on the task of running a White House besieged by a drumbeat of investigations. He took over just before Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, and before former special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his report on Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

Interestingly, he is currently being paid the salary as head of the CFPB as well as Chief of Staff, so he is unlikely to push to become the permanent Chief of Staff or risk his position as head of the CFPB. The most likely reason his tenure as Chief of Staff would end early is a falling out between him and Trump, and his actions indicate his desire to avoid such a falling-out.

For any other randomly chosen administration, I'd start it at ~19%. Of the 34 that preceded Mulvaney - including \"acting\" chiefs - 9 lasted less than 1 year, but 4 of those started within a year of the end of a president's term (I chose to include those 4 in the >1year group, it should be noted that there are strong argument to treat them other ways).  Only Gerald Ford (who served 1 term and had the Chief of Staff position vacant for 2.5 years of that time) and George H W Bush (who served one term and brought on his third chief of staff with 150 days remaining in his term) have had multiple Chiefs of Staff that did not last 1 year. As the current administration has already had Reince Priebus ousted after 190 days, it would be unusual but possible to see another <1 year term. Based on that, I'd dial the 19% back to ~15%. Now we come to the reality of the current administration. Pundits and comedians alike discuss the rampant turnover in the first 2 years of this aministration. How true are the jokes? This administration has seen roughly the same turnover of the initial \"A Team\" in 2.5 years that most recent administrations saw over 4 years. (Brookings has a nice breakdown of this here https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/ ) That is, of course, not quite the data we need. Mick Mulvaney is not a member of the \"A Team\" as the Brookings Institute defines it. However, we do see there is real data behind the sense that the current administration is seeing unusually high turnover. We also see 3 cabinet posts with 3 or more departures (of 15 senior level rolls which have 2 or more departures). This administration seems far more likely to see 2 Chiefs of Staff with <1 year tenure than a randomly chosen administration. I would say roughly on the order of twice as likely, arriving at 30%. Recent news suggests the president is unhappy with Mulvaney (one of several examples here https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/trump-mick-mulvaney-white-house-1379594 ); when the current president tires of a senior staff member, they have not been long for their position. Normally, I would boost this by 2x or more (might say as high as 80% if I were in a particularly bullish mood) as 6 months will be a long time for Mulvaney to keep his position in this cabinet while drawing the ire of the president. That said, there are other considerations: Mulvaney repeatedly publicly supported shutting down the government early this year, he has reportedly been using Camp David and loading trips on Air Force One with his preferred staffers, and he is upsetting Republican lawmakers. It could be advantageous to keep him around until the politically appropriate time, cover him in blame and give the appearance of \"cleaning house\" to draw media attention and excitement from the Democratic primaries in H1 of 2020. Moreover, while brief, the last search for a Chief of staff was very embarrassing for the president with multiple politicians publicly declining the role. The president is not averse to controversy; however, embarrassment may be the driver that keeps him in check. Here I land at only a +5% from the previous 30%, the president's apparent tiring of Mulvaney doesn't yet seem to be strong ire and he will avoid another embarrassing situation if possible. Additionally, as the Politico article above states, Mulvaney has been very hands-off with the president - something I assume the president appreciates. 35% - unlikely, but still well in the realm of possible."], [14107, "2019-07-03T03:23:13Z", [0.4], ""], [70661, "2019-07-02T19:50:11Z", [0.69], ""], [1333, "2019-07-02T19:17:22Z", [0.59], ""], [75752, "2019-07-02T19:11:04Z", [0.67], "He will be forced out of his cabinet position and replaced by someone who will be more receptive to Trump's requests."], [75735, "2019-07-02T17:02:24Z", [0.8], ""], [75735, "2019-07-02T17:01:52Z", [0.35], ""], [75735, "2019-07-02T17:00:48Z", [0.85], "Not many people survive more than a year in this white house let alone chiefs of staff."], [691, "2019-07-02T16:00:41Z", [0.6], ""], [484, "2019-07-02T15:29:50Z", [1.0], "(no change) Perhaps there will be some awkward publicity related to DTs 4th and new Sherman tank blather.

January 1, 2020 is only 264 days away.  Hence, if Mulvaney lasts the average of his two predecessors, he will only last another (355.5 -117 days already served= )  238.5--about 25 days short.  I did not compute a variance for two chiefs, but it would have been high, and the sample size is small.  Thus, the outside view is less reliable.  I suspect Priebus may not have lasted because he refused or resisted going along with Trump's crazier requests, e.g., announcing Trump had the largest inaugural crowd ever.  Kelly may have lasted so long out of a sense of duty to the country based upon what I read.  He clearly hated the job.   Trump tosses out experienced and qualified staff like old shoes.   It seems like the sleezyer the staffer, the longer they last, e.g.,  Sarah Saunders, Kelly Ann Conway, Steven Miller ,.. need I go on.  The key ingredients seem to be loyalty to Trump, not embarassing Trump and not outshining Trump--unless you are defending him.  Really, unconditional loyalty in the face of the Russian, tax and financial investigations and scandals seems to be the key to longevity.     Mulvaney seems to meet the criteria for staying as stated above.   That is,   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Mulvaney.   Thus, outside view would probably be about 45 percent chance that he will STAY.  The high variance  and small sample size reduces the probability  to maybe 35 percent.   The inside view would add 35 percent, given the factors listed above.   Yielding a final 70 percent probability of Mulvaney staying.  I realize that I am allowing my dislike of Trump and his administration to influence my position.  So, maybe, I should knock off another 10 percent.  But, then again maybe not.  So I end up with a 30 percent chance of CEASING to be Chief.   (I need to change the number in the estimate box; it was a typo.) I wonder if I have over-stated the inside view.  Again, the outside is less reliable because of the high variance and small sample size.  Moreover, it does seem that it was Trump's original appointees who did not last long.  It also seems a lot of them were government professionals who resisted his nonsense or were chosen just because they were prominent Republicans with strong support in the party but no ties or personal loyalty to Trump.    Trump's subsequent appointments did not suffer from the same bouts of common sense or lack of unconditional loyalty  in the face of his many scandals.  Hence, it took Trump a little while to find the right people for his White House.

I feel that those who have a history of being at all critical of Trump are very likely to ultimately not get along, and possibly be removed or resign. It does not seem like Mick particularly gets along with Trump, and was critical of him before his Presidency. However, since then he seems to have demonstrated the ability to appease Trump very readily. I also think that the recent outcome of the Russian investigation has been favorable towards Trump, but also decreased overall political volatility. Despite Mick's title being acting, I am under the impression there are very few people that give Trump the yes-man acquiescence he expects, so I think the chances are \"good\" he maintains this position.

These included the two linked in the question information here, and this \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/mulvaney-south-carolina-chief-staff.html\nA search through articles written about Mulvaney in the NYT over the last month yielded little, so I took that to mean few developments since his appointment on how he's doing. These factors included:\n-He has lasted at the OMB for a long time, indicating his ability to work within the administration\n-But there are some indications he's interested in other positions, for example at USC (though this evidence doesn't seem too strong)\n-Past Chiefs of Staff have lasted 6 months and 18 months\n-He is listed as acting instead of permanent, even though the role does not require Congressional approval. This could indicate hedging on Trump's part in case it doesn't work out, or could have been driven by Mulvaney's desire to return to OMB (he has not given up his position). However, as written in the Politico article, he has brought his own staff in, indicating some permanence. Balancing the above factors, I set my forecast at 40%. I did a quick Fermi process to make sure I hadn't missed anything essential, and also played around with scope sensitivity. I.e. if the date was changed to 6 months from now, I would drop my forecast to 30%. However, if it was pushed out to the 2020 Presidential election, I would up it to 65%. Based on that I felt comfortable staying at 40%.  Finally I had a quick look at others' forecasts but found no additional evidence at this time.

Also, the previous CoS's under Trump have been rather short-lived (though Kelly lasted almost a year and a half).  If Mueller releases his report, there may be mass departures.  Trump has had a yearly turnover rate of 32.5% over the first two years of his presidency (see link). However, he has been with the administration since Nov 2017, and he is a Tea-Party Republican which means he is more in-line with Trump's extremism. At a minimum, there is a little over a half percent chance he will die in that time according to actuarial tables, so I would round that up to 1.  But the administration's turnover rate seems a better place to start, so 32.5%.  CoS has had an annual rate of 100% so far, so that should up the forecast.  On another forecast, I currently have a 48% chance of Mueller releasing his report in roughly the first half of the year, bump that up to maybe 75% for the full year.  So I'm going to average the 32.5% and the 100% to get 66.25%.  I want to knock that down by a third because of the Tea-Party affiliation and the time he's already spent in the admin, so 44.17%  That means 55.83% chance he stays without the Mueller report, 25% there won't be a report this year, and I will guess a 10% chance of him staying if there is a report.  .5583*.25+.75*.1=0.2146   A 21.46% chance he stays, 78.54% chance he's gone.
