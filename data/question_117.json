The U.S. decision, said one of the officials, is part of an effort by the administration to improve relations with Russia, which along with Iranian-supported groups has largely succeeded in preserving Assad's government in the six-year-civil war. The CIA program began in 2013 as part of efforts by the administration of then-President Barack Obama to overthrow Assad, but produced little success, said the officials, both of whom are familiar with the program and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Washington Post was first to report the program's suspension on Wednesday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to comment on the topic at the White House briefing. The CIA also declined to comment. The decision was made with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and CIA Director Mike Pompeo after they consulted with lower ranking officials and before Trump's July 7 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Germany.

Anadolu news agency published a report on Tuesday naming the location of 10 U.S. military posts in northern Syria, in some cases detailing the number of U.S and French troops present. \"The release of sensitive military information exposes Coalition forces to unnecessary risk and has the potential to disrupt ongoing operations to defeat ISIS,\" said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, using an acronym for Islamic State. \"While we cannot independently verify the sources that contributed to this story, we would be very concerned if officials from a NATO ally would purposefully endanger our forces by releasing sensitive information,\" Pahon said. He added that the United States has voiced its concerns to Turkey. Relations between Ankara and Washington have already been shaken by a U.S. decision to support and arm Kurdish YPG fighters to drive Islamic State from their Raqqa stronghold in Syria. Turkey views the YPG as a branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the outlawed Kurdish separatist group that has been waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s. It fears an effort to form a contiguous Kurdish state embracing some Turkish territory. Ankara was infuriated last month when Washington \u2013 which has designated the PKK as a terrorist group - announced that it would continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy of arming the YPG, although U.S. officials insist that the United States will retrieve the weapons provided once Islamic State is defeated.

Turkey was angered by a U.S. decision last month to arm the YPG as part of the battle for Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.

The two leaders spoke by phone for the first time since U.S. relations with Russian were strained by the U.S. attack on a Syrian airfield. They two leaders set the foundation for what could be their first face-to-face meeting in July. Statements from both the White House and the Kremlin suggested the two leaders had a productive conversation that included North Korea and fighting Islamist militants throughout the Middle East. A senior Trump administration official said Putin had requested the call and described it as an effort to present his ideas for Syria. Trump ordered 59 cruise missiles launched in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that the United States blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The attacked prompted protests from Assad ally Russia, which blamed Syrian rebels for the use of outlawed nerve gas and said Assad was not at fault. The White House said the two leaders agreed that \"all parties must do all they can to end the violence\" in Syria. \"The conversation was a very good one, and included the discussion of safe, or de-escalation, zones to achieve lasting peace for humanitarian and many other reasons,\" a White House statement said. Trump during his presidential campaign last year frequently said he wanted safe zones established for Syrian refugees, paid for by Gulf states, to alleviate any need for the refugees to move elsewhere, including to the United States. Candidate Trump had also expressed a desire for a U.S. alliance with Russia to fight Islamist militants, a goal that has been elusive since he took office on Jan. 20. With a ceasefire ever elusive in Syria, the White House said Washington would send a representative to ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The State Department said acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones will attend as an observer. The decision to send Jones to the talks, even as an observer, is an indication that the United States is taking the Astana talks more seriously. Previously, the U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George Krol had attended the talks as an observer. The Kremlin said Putin and Trump agreed to step up dialogue on finding ways to strengthen a ceasefire and give it stability (para. 1-14). Holland, S. & Winning, A. (2017).

In his briefing, Staffan de Mistura, the UN Special Envoy for Syria added that last week\u2019s reported chemical weapons attack, the subsequent airstrikes by the US and intensified fighting on the ground have put the fragile peace process is in \u201cgrave danger.\u201d \u201cThis is a time for clear-thinking, strategy, imagination, cooperation,\u201d said Mr. de Mistura. \u201cWe must all resolve that the time has come where the intra-Syrian talks move beyond preparatory discussions and into the real heart of the matter, across all four baskets, to secure a meaningful negotiated transition package,\u201d he added. Prior to the reported chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun area of Idlib, modest but incremental progress were made, the UN envoy noted, highlighting that though there no breakthroughs, there were also no breakdowns. The most recent round of talks, facilitated by the UN in Geneva, wrapped up two weeks ago. However, the reported attack and subsequent events have placed the country between two paths: one leading more death, destruction and regional and international divisions; and the other of real de-escalation and ceasefire, added Mr. de Mistura.

The United States launched dozens of missiles earlier this month against a Syrian air base in response to a chemical attack that killed 90 people, including 30 children. It says the Syrian government launched the attack from the Shayrat air base. The Pentagon has said that the strike had damaged or destroyed about 20 percent of the Syrian military's operational aircraft. During a press conference alongside his Israeli counterpart, Mattis was asked whether the Syrian military had moved warplanes to a Russian base in Latakia. \"They have dispersed their aircraft, no doubt. They have dispersed their aircraft in recent days,\" Mattis said. Mattis also reiterated that the United States believed Syria had retained some chemical weapons. \"The bottom line is, I can say authoritatively they have retained some (chemical weapons). It's a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, and it's going to have to be taken up diplomatically,\" Mattis said. Israel's military said on Wednesday it believed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces still possessed several tonnes of chemical weapons.

The three countries blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces for the attack, which killed dozens of people. The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons. U.N. Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said the \"horrific\" chemical attack had come from the air. The draft text, seen by Reuters, says Syria's government must provide an international investigation with flight plans and logs for Tuesday, the names of all helicopter squadron commanders and provide access to air bases where investigators believe attacks using chemicals may have been launched. It asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report monthly on whether the Syrian government is cooperating with an international investigation and a fact-finding mission into chemical weapons use in Syria.

The two sides do not meet but negotiate via U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura, saving their liveliest invective for the TV cameras after each meeting with him. Opposition negotiator Nasr al-Hariri said the \"terrorist regime\" of President Bashar al-Assad had refused to discuss political transition during the talks and said Assad was a war criminal who must step down in the name of peace. \"They are solely discussing their empty rhetoric about countering terrorism,\" Hariri told reporters, vowing there could be \"no peace without justice.\" \"War crimes and crimes against humanity must not be an option for negotiations. From now, venues must be found for transitional justice to ensure holding the perpetrators accountable,\" he said. Hariri said he was looking for a negotiating partner who put the interests of the Syrian people first, while his opposite number, the government's chief negotiator, Bashar al Ja'afari, said he only wanted to negotiate with someone \"patriotic\". Ja'afari mocked the opposition delegation as \"adolescents\" who thought they were appearing on a television talent show such as \"Arab Idol\" or \"The Voice\", and were under the illusion that government would simply hand over the keys to the country. \"In fact, they are tools, they are mercenaries in the hands of their lords, their operators, and it seems they have not received instructions from them, except instructions to continue supporting terrorism and to create havoc in these rounds\" (para. 1-8).

While the ceasefire talks have made no ground, a first round of political talks in Geneva was procedural, producing only an agenda for the current round, which will encompass four topics: a new constitution, new elections, reformed governance and the fight against terrorism. \"I am not expecting miracles, I am not expecting breakthroughs and I am not expecting a breakdown,\" said de Mistura, adding he hoped to see \"incremental steps\" (para. 1-6).

The third round of talks is due to take place in Astana on March 14-15. The previous meetings aimed to shore up a widely-violated ceasefire between the sides that was brokered in December by Russia and Turkey, which backs the rebels. Russia backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the conflict, and launched recent diplomatic efforts after its air force helped the Syrian government to defeat rebels in Aleppo in December - Assad's biggest victory of the war. In a statement, the rebels said they had received an invitation to a third round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana but this should be delayed until after the end of the ceasefire. \"The continuation of the meetings is linked to an assessment of the results of the ceasefire and commitment to it,\" the rebel groups said. The rebels said the government and its Iranian-backed militia allies were continuing to bombard opposition-held areas near Damascus, Homs, Deraa and Idlib, and preparing to storm two districts on the outskirts of the Syrian capital (Para. 1-6).

With the self-styled caliphate rapidly shrinking in Iraq after the loss of much of Mosul, the fall of Raqqa and Islamic State\u2019s remaining territories in Syria has become just a matter of time. The contest over who gets these spoils, however, threatens to unleash a new spiral of violence that could draw regional and global powers deeper into the conflict. The three forces aiming for Raqqa\u2014Sunni Arab rebels, the Syrian regime and Kurdish-led militias\u2014all view control over that area as giving them crucial leverage in any political settlement of the war. The complicated dynamic is further muddled by the strategic calculations of their main sponsors, whose own interests extend far beyond the power struggle inside Syria. Turkey, the main supporter of the rebel Free Syrian Army and allied Sunni Arab militias, is most interested in weakening the main Syrian Kurdish political faction, which is affiliated with the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. The PKK is waging a violent campaign inside Turkey and is considered a terrorist group by Washington and Ankara alike. For Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who sent troops to fight alongside the FSA in northern Syria last August, winning the April 16 referendum on vastly expanding his own powers represents an even more important priority. He has little to gain in the referendum campaign from a dramatic escalation of the Syrian conflict. For the Syrian regime\u2019s main backer Russia, which has developed ties with the Syrian Kurds and, of late, with some Sunni Arab rebels, the main goal is to capitalize on its costly investment in Syria and to cement the achievements of its military campaign through a political deal. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is still reviewing its Syria policy. Its actions, for now, remain driven almost exclusively by the military priorities in the battle against Islamic State, with limited attention to America\u2019s other interests and alliances in the region. Recent events in the northern Syrian city of Manbij, seized by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces from Islamic State in August, highlight just how volatile the situation has become. Syrian regime and Kurdish offensives against Islamic State last month in the area effectively blocked Turkey and its Sunni proxies from heading toward Raqqa (para. 1-9). Trofimov, Y. (2017).

The week-long talks sponsored by the United Nations were mired in process. For more than a week, the Syrian government and opposition delegations met separately with U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura, but much of the discussion was about how to conduct the talks and what would be included in the agenda. The main opposition body, the High Negotiations Committee, sought to make a political transition deal the main agenda of the talks. The opposition continues to demand the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad even as the regime appears increasingly victorious against weakened rebels. \u201cAlthough there is almost nothing encouraging in terms of achieving anything, but we are determined to go this road which is beneficial for the Syrian people,\u201d said Yahya al-Aridi, an adviser to the opposition delegation. \u201cWe want a political solution. The best way to fight terrorism is by helping [a] political transition take place.\u201d The government delegation, headed by Syria\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Bashar al-Jaafari, insisted on making the defeat of terrorism part of the agenda. The Syrian regime has long referred to most elements of the opposition as terrorists (para. 1-5). Expectations were low going into the talks as a shaky, two-month-old cease-fire meant to lay the groundwork for political discussions appeared increasingly at risk of falling apart amid escalating regime airstrikes and clashes between the two sides (para. 8). As the U.S., has shrunk its role in brokering peace in Syria\u2014including under the new Trump administration\u2014Russia has stepped up its role alongside Turkey, which backs several rebel groups. But even with Russia pushing for a settlement, prospects for a political resolution still appear distant as the regime remains defiantly opposed to talks of a transition, and allied Iranian-backed Shiite militias on the ground further complicate Syria\u2019s battlefield (para. 10).

Syrian government negotiator Bashar al-Ja'afari told reporters that he had discussed \"substantive issues, particularly counter-terrorism\" with U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura, and would continue on Friday. The government delegation has sought to focus peace talks around counter-terrorism - which is how it frames the battle with all its armed opponents - while the opposition wants to discuss political transition, which it says must mean President Bashar al-Assad giving up power. Ja'afari said the opposition High Negotiations Committee was holding the peace talks hostage, and accused some of its members of \"high treason\" by receiving support from Saudi Arabia, Israel and Turkey. \"The Riyadh opposition will be held responsible for any failure of the Geneva talks,\" Ja'afari said. \nRussia is seen as holding the balance of power in Syria and as being the powerbroker behind the peace talks.

The class had just finished a two-week training course run by U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers and SDF trainers in the hollowed-out shell of this tiny village in northern Syria, which was pulverized during a fierce fight last year between the SDF and retreating Islamic State fighters. The militiamen \u2014 until recently students, laborers, and family men \u2014 quickly grabbed their new rifles and embraced their new job, forced on them by forces beyond their control. Several of them said they would gladly go back to their civilian lives once the fighting stopped, but that the Islamic State and Turkey were threats they couldn\u2019t ignore. For the Americans, providing weapons and basic combat skills to the young fighters is the easy part of their mission. The ethnic politics of arming local forces presents a more daunting challenge. The U.S. military maintains a light footprint in northern Syria, with small teams operating four training centers to funnel Kurdish and Arab forces into the fight for the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, and to protect gains the Kurds have made in the north around the nearby city of Manbij. Other U.S. forces are closer to the fight in Raqqa, accompanying the SDF in their move on the city, and helping call in airstrikes on Islamic State positions. Overall there are about 500 U.S. troops in the country.\nNortheast of the training range near the city of Kobani on the Turkish border, U.S. forces have constructed a hardened landing strip for C-130 and C-17 cargo planes full of equipment for the Syrian Arab forces and to supply U.S. troops operating throughout the north. The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Joseph Votel, and the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen Stephen Townsend, visited the site on Friday along with a few reporters for a first-hand look. The site promises to be a key hub in the fight to retake Raqqa and in the continuing effort to build up the SDF, which is growing week by week as U.S. soldiers move them through the training program. As of now, the Arab part of the SDF \u2014 the Syrian Arab Coalition \u2014 numbers about 23,000 fighters, while the battle-hardened Kurdish contingent makes up the remaining 27,000. That imbalance is an issue in the Raqqa campaign, and in the U.S. debate whether to supply arms to the Kurds, or only to the Syrian Arabs. The Trump administration has yet to announce a decision on whether it will provide weapons to the Kurdish forces, and how it comes down the issue could shape the course of the war and Washington\u2019s relations with Ankara. One of several options on the table is increasing the number of U.S. troops in Syria, perhaps even with conventional forces that could provide more help in capturing Raqqa (para. 1-10). McLeary, P.

Rebel officials said that no official explanation had been given for the move this month following the jihadist assault, though several said they believed the main objective was to prevent arms and cash falling into Islamist militant hands. But they said they expected the aid freeze to be temporary.\nThe halt in assistance, which has included salaries, training, ammunition and in some cases guided anti-tank missiles, is a response to jihadist attacks and has nothing to do with U.S. President Donald Trump replacing Barack Obama in January, two U.S. officials familiar with the CIA-led program said. The freeze reflects the troubles facing Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels in the almost six-year-old revolt against Assad, who now appears militarily unassailable in his core western region largely thanks to direct intervention on his side by Russia and Iran. \"The reality is that you have changes in the area, and these changes inevitably have repercussions,\" said an official with one of the affected FSA rebel groups. He said no military assistance could \"enter at present until matters are organized. There is a new arrangement but nothing has crystallized yet\". The support funneled to vetted FSA factions has included contributions from Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - states that have opposed Assad. It is one of several foreign aid channels to rebels. Others still function. The CIA declined comment on the reported freeze in support. A Qatari official said his government had nothing to say on the matter. Turkish officials said only they could not discuss \"operational details\". There was no word from Saudi Arabia. Reuters confirmed the freeze with officials from five of the FSA groups that have been recipients of financial and military support from the so-called \"MOM operations room\". It was also confirmed by two other senior FSA figures briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity given the covert nature of the CIA-backed program and the sensitivity of the subject.\nSeveral rebels believed the aid halt was temporary, with new arrangements expected, but there was no clarity yet. Confirming the freeze, two senior FSA sources said donor states were aiming to send the aid to one, unified fighting force - a coherence that has eluded rebels throughout Syria's civil war. One of the FSA officials said he did not expect the rebels to be abandoned as they represent the best hope for blocking a further expansion of Sunni jihadist influence in Syria, and to fight back against the growing role of Iran there (para. 1-11).

This time around he is about to re-align with the US. \nLast month, Manila filed a protest before the Chinese Embassy over Beijing's reported military buildup on the islands and reefs in the contested Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. \nThe protest comes one month after President Duterte promised to respect defense treaties with \u201cfriend\u201d and \u201cally,\u201d the United States, and two months after Manila warmed up to Beijing and announced a \u201cdivorce\u201d from Washington. \nInvestors get unsettled with high profile flip-flops. They magnify political risks, which add to other investment risks. That's especially the case for countries like Philippines suffering from persistent political instability since the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, as Ruchir Sharma observes in The Breakout Nations. \nThat's why Philippines\u2019 equity markets headed south after Duterte flip-flopped. \nWhat made Duterte change his mind this time around? \nIt\u2019s hard to say. One plausible answer is China\u2019s ongoing aggression, telling America to stay away from its \u201cown\u201d South China Sea. And sending a warning message to Taiwan in the form of a naval force demonstration \u2013 recently, a group of Chinese warships that included the country\u2019s only aircraft carrier made its way to the South China Sea after passing south of Taiwan in a \u201croutine\u201d exercise. \nAnother plausible answer is a recent survey, which showed 84 percent of Filipinos want Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to assert his country's rights over its territories in the South China Sea. \nA third plausible answer is a new administration in Washington, which has promised to contain China\u2019s South China Sea ambitions. \nKeeping a record on Philippines\u2019 President\u2019s position on South China Sea disputes is a rather tricky task. Duterte\u2019s flip-flops can be traced back to last July after an international arbitration ruling, which found that China has no historic title over the waters. \nThat was a big victory for both the Philippines, which had filed the arbitration case, and its close ally the US, which wants those waterways to be an open sea (para. 1-11).

While the last constitutional committee took only four months, it was not the type of contentious negotiation that the Russian-led process is likely to be. Assuming a 25% chance that the new constitution is implemented by end of September 2017, and a 2% chance that the question resolves to Yes through some other unexpected means (death of Assad, opposition victory), my current forecast is 27%. If one of the outcomes of the Astana talks is a deadline for implementation of the new constitution by end of September, or a deadline for elections before the end of the year, I'll increase my forecast to 52% or more (depending on how the talks go).

Ideally, Mr. Assad would go. But the prospect of his ouster is not realistic now, given recent battlefield trends and Russia\u2019s role. More plausibly, he could rule an autonomous zone in a new confederation. Less desirably, he could remain president of the country for a time, provided that Sunni and Kurd areas did not have to suffer his direct rule or the presence of his security forces again.

The exchange was part of a series of public exchanges that have characterized dialogue between Moscow and Washington in the absence of progress to end the Aleppo siege. The tendentious remarks came as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told Western journalists invited to interview him in Damascus that he intended to stay in office at least until his current term ends in 2021. \u201cIf you\u2019re the captain of the ship, when you have a storm, you don\u2019t jump into the water,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cYou lead it to shore.\u201d Far from trying to destroy the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, Assad told the group, including journalists from the New York Times and the New Yorker, that the United States is supporting both that group and al-Qaeda allies in Syria. \u201cThe whole argument that the United States wants to fight ISIS is not correct,\u201d Assad said, according to the New Yorker. \u201cThis is an illusion and information.\u201d The actual U.S. goal, he said, is to topple his government (para 1-8).

Since 2012, Obama has been stubbornly arguing that there is no workable option for even a limited U.S. intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. John F. Kerry, Hillary Clinton, David Petraeus and Leon E. Panetta, among others, pushed the president to use U.S. air power or stepped-up support for rebels to tilt the balance of the war against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, thereby making possible a political settlement favorable to the United States and its allies. Obama repeatedly refused. There was no way to get involved, he said, without starting the U.S. military down a slippery slope that would lead to another quagmire, like Iraq or Afghanistan. Anyway, he said, U.S. intervention would only worsen the war, encourage extremism and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis. All those bad things happened in the absence of American action. And now Putin has proved that the concept Obama rejected \u2014 that a limited use of force could change the political outcome, without large costs \u2014 was right all along.

Further, the wide\ndiversity of threat types makes first order prioritization challenging for senior decisionmakers.\nMENA boasts a potential nuclear power with a penchant for destabilizing regional\nproxy wars; a series of state-killing civil conflicts; myriad extremist groups that\nemerge from and thrive on endemic regional instability; and generalized rejectionist\ntrends that fast undermine the authority and reach of even the region\u2019s most capable\nstates. Action against one or more of these will inevitably affect the nature and magnitude\nof risk associated with others.\nThe 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq is the first of many clear examples in this regard.\nIn large measure, there is an expert consensus that the United States is where it is in Iraq\nand Syria precisely because of the deliberate collapse of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.197 On\na smaller scale, Libya and Yemen also demonstrate the risk of U.S. action. In a desire to\nimprove its position, U.S. actions contributed to a collapse of both Libya and Yemen.\nThis collapse led to a security vacuum followed by rampant instability.\nA newfound U.S. Government appreciation of the risks of action have led it at times\nto embrace inaction or limited action in the region. In Syria, many perceive that U.S.\ninaction allowed the situation to worsen.198 Further, it opened new unhelpful operating\nspace for U.S. adversaries. Russia and Iran, for example, are perceived to have seized\non U.S. hesitation to more actively aid the Assad regime.199 Similarly, many argue that\nAmerican passivity in the face of increasing violence and instability in Iraq between\n2010-2014 highlight the hazards of inaction as well. During that period, a more assertive\nU.S. commitment may have limited ISIL operating space and prevented its de facto\ncontrol over large areas of Iraqi territory. ( p.62) There is an answer but no indication US has embraced it:\n\"RISK\u2014GET BACK IN THE GAME OR GET ON THE SIDELINES\nGreat power competition in the 21st century\u2014like that of the 19th and 20th centuries\u2014is\na contact sport. The rules and conventions change but effectively competing is\nthe only way to thrive and win. The Cold War, in particular, is a useful reminder of the\nneed to compete\" (p. 66) \n\"U.S. strategic leaders generally, and DoD leadership specifically, should take three\ncues from the United States\u2019 gray zone past. First, identify and define the principal character\nof the most urgent defense-relevant threats to core U.S. interests. There are many\nthreats to American interests; those emerging from the gray zone do not always appear\ndefense-centric at first. However, any response to them will all have important defense\ncomponents.\nSecond, design a viable and adaptive strategic approach to confront, defeat, or manage\nthose threats at acceptable levels of risk. Here, the DoD will be one of many important\nplayers in wider U.S. Government responses. The DoD can, however, assume that\nit will be responsible for leading, following, or underwriting all U.S. counter-gray zone\nresponses. In addition, its planning culture may push it ahead of its counterparts in\nother U.S. Government agencies in taking on the gray zone challenge.\nFinally, create a corporate culture that supports mechanisms and operational tools\nthat will allow for effective campaigning against gray zone challenges. This requirement\nspans responsibilities for strategy development, military planning, and operational execution.\nIf there is one overarching lesson from past experience, it is that understanding\nthe competitive landscape, designing adaptable courses through that terrain toward\nstrategic objectives, and persistently operating with purpose in pursuit of those ends are\nessential components of success\" (p.69)"], [4042, "2016-08-26T10:55:29Z", [0.0], ""], [691, "2016-08-25T20:17:27Z", [0.11], ""], [368, "2016-08-25T18:11:16Z", [0.0], ""], [4273, "2016-08-25T03:31:29Z", [0.1], ""], [691, "2016-08-24T21:38:16Z", [0.11], ""], [28545, "2016-08-24T18:57:34Z", [0.3], ""], [368, "2016-08-24T17:21:43Z", [0.0], ""], [10759, "2016-08-24T11:00:11Z", [0.12], ""], [4634, "2016-08-24T11:00:01Z", [0.12], ""], [691, "2016-08-23T19:29:59Z", [0.11], ""], [368, "2016-08-23T16:53:32Z", [0.0], ""], [28414, "2016-08-23T14:49:26Z", [0.15], ""], [2965, "2016-08-23T14:05:18Z", [0.0], "see my comments while Syria and Turkey are attacking YPG in Syria hard partition continues with Turkey support\nNow  continuing attack on  US forces with  YPG (Kurds )http://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-warns-assad-regime-to-avoid-action-near-u-s-and-allied-forces-1471633476\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-backed-force-takes-key-syrian-city-from-islamic-state-1471037799\nThose Kurds are now under attack with US forces\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/syria-shifts-stance-toward-kurds-1471944602 President Erdogan has previously called repeatedly for Mr. Assad to step down and said the Syrian leader should be tried for state terrorism at the International Criminal Court. But Turkey has softened its tone lately, with Mr. Yildirim saying on Saturday that his government must accept that Mr. Assad remains a person of influence in Syria and that he might continue to play a role during a transitional stabilization period. Many senior YPG commanders have in fact trained and fought alongside the PKK for years. But the U.S., which relies on the YPG as the most effective fighting force against Islamic State in Syria, has sought to distinguish between the two militias. The YPG along with its political arm have used the war against Islamic State to expand the territories in Syria under Kurdish control, including leading battles in predominantly Arab areas to link up two separate Kurdish cantons. The establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region was only made possible by Syrian regime forces withdrawing earlier in the war from predominantly Kurdish areas and allowing Kurdish political groups and militias to take over government institutions. The withdrawal was strategic, as the Syrian regime was stretched thin fighting rebels and later Islamic State militants on multiple fronts. \u201cThe regime\u2019s policy previously was to avoid clashes [with Kurds], since the priority was fighting the [rebel] forces supported by Turkey,\u201d said Ahmad Hisso Araj, a Kurdish spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces.

It's by far the most mathematically involved I've done to date. In order to get a base rate for this question, I looked at other occasions where a ruler was deposed (Saddam, Mubarak, Ben Ali, Gaddafi) and how long it took for UN-backed elections to be held after that. I could have looked at depositions/elections in other regions at other times, but there is so much data from that region and from the recent past that  it didn't seem necessary. Here is the data: * Egypt: Mubarak ousted in Jan 2011 [1], elections held May 2012 [2] (15 months)\n* Iraq: Saddam ousted Apr 2003 [3], elections held Jan 2005 [4] (20 months)\n* Tunisia: Ben Ali ousted Jan 2011 [5], elections held Oct 2011 [6] (9 months)\n* Libya: Gaddafi ousted Aug 2011 [7], elections held Jul 2012 [8] (11 months) The Iraq case arguably belongs to a different context (non-Arab Spring) but it has the prolonged war in common with present-day Syria. So let's estimate that, on average, it takes (15+20+9+11)/4 ~ 14 months to have an election after the current government is ousted, with a standard deviation of ~5 months. I want to adjust this for Syria. There seems to be a (negative) correlation between \"how long it takes to have elections\" and \"gdp per capita\" (just Google the gdps per capita of Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia & Libya). I think I can tell a story about why that should be; gdp per capita is a proxy for development / infrastructure, and in order to put together elections a lot of logistics needs to be handled, which being developed / having infrastructure helps. (You might think population size would influence election complexity, but thanks to command hierarchies this effect is probably logarithmic, hence small.) Sadly, Syria has been very damaged by war [9]; based on the satellite pictures and nighttime brightness of cities, I'd estimate at least half its infrastructure and buildings have been destroyed. Of the countries examined above, only Iraq might have suffered comparable (and probably less) destruction. The other conflicts were just too short. So I want to push the expected time-to-election-after-ousting to at least 18 months for Syria. (I feel like better telecom today might make elections easier to do today than in 2003 Iraq.) OK, under this model (average = 18, sd = 5) here are the odds for time between government ousting and elections:   0 -  8 months:    3%\n  8 - 13 months: 13%\n13 - 18 months: 34%;\n18 -  \u221e months: 50% Presumably one can't hold elections without ousting the current government; the question then becomes, when will Assad get out, if ever? Of the rulers mentioned above, three were ousted within mere weeks of conflict starting (Mubarak, Saddam, Ben Ali), and one in about 6 months (Gaddafi); Assad on the other hand has been holding on for 4-5 years depending on how you define \"start of conflicts\". We are 20.5 months from 1 Jan 2018. Due to continued Russian support [10] I think it is wildly unlikely that Assad will fall in the next 2.5 months, so already that caps a YES answer to the question at 50%, since there's a 50% chance elections would take longer than 18 months to organize after Assad's fall. OK, what are the chances Assad would fall 2.5 - 7.5 months from now? What about 7.5 - 12.5 months from now? I have no idea so I will use a base rate again, with questionable probabilistic reasoning. Assume right now is a random time during Assad's rule. Then there is a ~10% chance it is in the last ~10% of it. Thus the odds that it will end in 2.5 - 7.5 months or less are ~10%. A similar calculation yields a ~16% chance it ends in 7.5 - 12.5 months. Finally, to combine: the probability we get elections before 1 Jan 2018 is between 10%*16% + 16%*1%   -- and --   10%*50% + 16%*16% i.e. between 1.8% and 7.5%; let's call it 5%. Finally, I will adjust it down to 3% because the Russian support is a recent development and makes it less likely that Assad will be ousted than it was in the past.

The Syrian Civil War started March the 15th, 2011, placing it roughly 5 years in the past. Therefore we expect that this conflict will end in 2021. Bear in mind that this is pure base line.  The New York Times states that civil wars last on average between 7 and 15 years[1], and the Washington Post states that they last on average 10 years, but provides no analysis of the variance[2]. Taking all this together implies that, from the outside, the war has between 2 and 10 years left in the tank. That's a huge gap. Taking the mid-point of the New York Times' midrange, we can create an estimate of about 10.33... years for the total length of the conflict, of which 5 has passed. This places the end of the conflict in 2021. For this question to be resolved, we'd need both for the conflict to subside, and for democratic elections to be arranged and held. That requires the construction of significant institutions within the afflicted country, which can take a long time. As a yard-stick, The Iraq War started in March of 2003, Saddam was captured in December of that year, and elections were held in January 2005. This is a  delay of 1 year, 1 month, and 17 days. With this in mind, we can assume that roughly 1 year would given over to preparations for the elections. In essence, the civil war needs to come to a close within the year. This is an outside contender. Assuming that the New York Times article was quoting an inter-quartile range, we're sat in the <25% region. On the other hand, Russia has just pulled out (Thanks @AndrewSabinsky). This may be an indication that the war is close to it's end than we expect? It may be the case that a negotiated end to hostilities may be about to break out. And a negotiated end may well include the promise of democratic elections. I do consider this to be an outside contender -- the negotiations must end within a year for there to be time to set up elections. I'm calling it at 13% for the moment.

Without being redundant let me try my own approach with a new element: Assad and his government are Alawites, a branch of Shia with their sworn enemy of the Sunni (which include the ISIS). The main supporter of Assad is essentially Iran, the main Shia state. Here an overview of the funds flowing in: http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-09/iran-spends-billions-to-prop-up-assad Thus the question must be re-interpreted to the financial support and political support capabilities to keep the Sunni out. So one must ask, now that sanctions are lifted in Iran, how much can they afford? http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/163.htm At 1.1 mbpd and 30$/bbl, this is 12 billion in revenue, and that was last year. It is expected to rise to easily 5 mbpd in the coming years and oil could come back to 100$/bbl, meaning, YES, they can afford it. Next point is Russia and the rebels. Aleppo, the most populace city will be re-taken and placed in government hands shortly. This should secure Assads power. But one must think of the total population. In 2013, there were 23 million, now only 18.5 million, and those who left are typically rebels, pansies and other deserters, meaning those left are typically more pro-Assad. Should a democratic vote be made, with 4-5 million less anti-Assad voters, it would lean in his favor. This brings me to the aspect that it is still officially a civil war and the victors tend to determine leadership in most cases. With Aleppo about to be re-taken, the war could be drawing a close with Assad (supported military be Russia and financially be Iran) securing his position for years to come. Last aspect, even if Assad were to be assassinated or remover via a coup, why would the next in line see the need to get UN support? What would be their advantage in doing so? The existing sanctions have little weight: http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/05/28-syria-sanctions/ For the oil and gas production is not in the hand of the government anyhow, but ISIS: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/how-iranian-oil-tankers-keep-syria-s-war-machine-alive With all that said, there is a near zero chance of an UN-led election process. The only possibility would be a full-scale western led war to force it, which I do not see happening anytime soon.

The base rate and the assessment mirror my own thinking to a considerable degree. In addition to what was concluded in that forecast, I\u2019ll just emphasize factors I consider particularly important.  First, recent events on the battlefield demonstrate that a negotiate settlement in this conflict is a long way off. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/world/middleeast/syria-aleppo.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Indeed, it appears the conflict may end in a military victory for Assad\u2019s forces. At that point, the prospect of UN backed elections by the resolution date seems all but impossible.  Second, in most civil wars, the power symmetries are much less complicated than the Syrian Civil War. \nWithout pressure from Russian and Iran, a military victory by Assad lowers the chances of UN backed elections considerably. Assad and his supporters would have no incentive to engage with a process where they would certainly lose power.  \nTherefore, the conflict needs to end with some kind of negotiated settlement. As previously mentioned, civil wars end in negotiate settlements when the power symmetries come closer to each other. The incentives and the value systems of the powers need to be at a point where a military solution is not projected to provide enough benefits to justify continuing the war. In addition, if belligerents are supported in a substantial way from outside forces, those forces need to be amenable to a settlement. In some cases, it is the outside forces who will demand a political/negotiated settlement. In the Syrian conflict, we are nowhere near these stages.  Third, the presence of ISIS and other extremist groups in the conflict compounds the complexity. In most civil wars, the belligerents are clearly defined and the power channels well marked. Not so in the Syrian conflict. The notion of a military victory for Assad begs the question: against whom? There is an array of groups and forces to defeat or subdue. In order for Assad to claim victory, his forces would have to be able to monopolize violence within the borders of Syria. Only at that point, would the \u201cstate\u201d of Syria regain its territorial integrity and its status as a \u2018state.\u2019  At present, it is a failed state.  These factors combined with what we know about how civil wars end more generally, make the likelihood of UN backed elections by January 2018 highly unlikely.  Within the time frame allotted by the question: Probability of military victory by Assad\u2019s forces leading to UN backed elections: 2.25\nProbability of military victory by rebel groups leading to UN backed elections: .10\nProbability of negotiated settlement leading to UN backed elections: .5 These probabilities do not project the likelihood of a military victory by the specified group\u2026.only that if such a victory was achieved, what is the likelihood of it leading to elections in the given period. At this point the momentum is on the side of Assad\u2019s forces \u2013 given Russian support. But, as mentioned, if Assad\u2019s forces win the battlefield in some meaningful way, there is almost zero incentive for UN backed elections (without outside pressure from Assad supporters).

If elections are slated for August 2017 at the earliest, that gives a 5-month window [August , December] for the question to be answered in the affirmative.

It just has a lot of moving parts, any one of which could get stick and hinder the rest of the process.

Yes, this is a very complex situation, but I believe there are several powerful underlying reasons why this will likely happen.  Although Putin certainly has been toying with us and has no interest in supporting our interests, he has what I believe is a very strong desire to be viewed on the world stage as a first-world, global power broker (see all his current military actions), and that bringing Assad to the table would greatly inform this perception in his mind.  Putin has also expressed willingness to bring opposition groups into the discussions.  I suspect this is because he knows that he will be able to ensure that Assad can run in the election and likely is confident that he (and Assad) can control the election results in their favor.  This is a win all around for Putin as he can ensure Assad remains in power and look like the global power broker (as he greatly desires) at the same time, all under the guise of a UN-backed free and open election.

A lot can change.  Here are a few scenarios: RUSSIA AND THE UN KISS AND MAKE UP: \nThe United States and Russia broker a peace deal in Ukraine and lift sanctions within the next few months. The United States privately tells Russia that in return for not pursuing the Crimea situation (although publicly they will continue to oppose its annexation) Russia will aid in overthrowing Daesh and help get Assad out of power - with the understanding that not anti-Russia groups will be allowed to dominate. \nTime considerations: Obama will want to get this done as quickly as possible. Negotiations in Ukraine may conclude in as little as a month with implementation of deals within as little as 2-3 months. With the deal concluded, Daesh could be mopped up in Syria in as little as 8-9 months. Raqqa and the 2-3 other \"major\" cities currently held in Syria by ISIS would not hold out long against a sustained ground-and-air campaign. \nIt doesn't really matter who the US president is after daesh is defeated because Russia would not likely renege on its deal. \nAt this point, Assad would be out and UN-backed elections could happen in as few as 3-4 months, putting it well within the time-frame specified by the question.  MAKE-UP, SCENE 2: THINGS DON'T WORK OUT AS WELL\nThis situation is essentially the same as above but with a few twists. \nEither \n- negotiations with Russia take longer (or implementation of deals takes longer)\n- daesh proves extremely resilient and/or US & Russia cannot garner enough local support to throw them out and either the UN or Assad claim elections cannot be held until Daesh is out completely \n- the next US president renounces the deal in Ukraine and Russia decides to prolong the conflict and/or continue to support Assad \n- with Daesh gone, Assad clings to power and the UN hesitates to \"back\" any elections in Syria  NO DEAL \nRussia and the US cannot agree on Ukraine. Or the US continues to vocally back Ukranian claims to Crimea. Or the US pushes dissatisfied groups within Crimea to rebel. Conflict continues in Ukraine. Russia sees no reason to conclude things in Syria. Or if it does, it strongly backs Assad and helps him stay once daesh is gone. The UN refuses to back elections in Syria.  I feel there are lots of combinations of the above that can occur but the key things to watch are \n- Ukraine: I strongly feel that Russia's involvement in Syria is as much a play towards a favorable resolution in Ukraine as it is to shield its naval interests in Syria \n- How quickly deals are made. If Obama can put things into motion before his departure, it will be a huge coup for his administration and would be difficult (and foolish) for the next president to undo\n- The next American president: if Obama does not manage to conclude negotiations, his successor will be crucial. In any case, the successor's role in implementation of any deals will be critical to success or failure in bringing the conflict in Syria to a close. Clinton has strongly positioned herself as a continuity candidate  and would likely continue many of Obama's priorities. A Sanders victory would also likely continue Obama's plans as I don't believe Sanders will have enough experience in foreign affairs at the beginning of his presidency to comfortably shift his policy significantly from Obama's. \nA Cruz or Trump presidency would be much, much more risky and either candidate might try to re-negotiate terms with Russia - a move Russia would resent and this would significantly delay the process.  A Rubio or Bush in office may see a pragmatic way towards resolution, although they may choose to deviate from commitments made by the Obama administration.  Anyway - will adjust with time.

Assad and the Russians want the \"loyal opposition \" to be at the table, which the expatriate opposition aren't accepting. Similarly, among those named by the expat opposition are groups designated by Russia as terrorist, being ideologically close to Al Qaeda and Daesh.  We currently have a little over 5 months \"float\" on this question. I  give Assad a 15% chance of not being President on 01 March 2017, and I don't believe we'll get to the UN's second stage of a \"transitional and inclusive government\", supposed to happen within six months of the initial talks, if Assad is still in charge. It'll be time to review only after seeing if or when the talks scheduled for 25 Jan commence, and after that whether they can reach any agreement on a transitional government.

Syria is a long way away from anything resembling stability and would benefit from an extended transitional gov. to mitigate overtly wartime politics being entrenched in peacetime institutions.  If optimistic plans by foreign powers call for UN-supported elections at the end of an 18-month transitional period then the approx. 23-month window in which this question would be settled looks too tight considering the current state of the conflict. The U.S. and Russia are still at odds over Assad with the former\u2019s stance seemingly softening within a transitional framework. Further Syrian National Coalition members have stated they believe the 18-month timeframe is too ambitious (1).  The upcoming peace negotiations will of course be telling but I expect Assad is likely to take a hard line following a string of victories with Russian Air support (2). Further, mediating powers have not yet agreed on who is eligible to take part in the upcoming UN-mediated talks on behalf of the opposition (3). The high likelihood of excluding some vital parties increases the risk of spoilers derailing any progress well before a process can reach elections.  Assad\u2019s tactical position has improved in the short-term making him less likely to agree to step down. If his presence is a non-starter for the opposition, who do not speak with one voice anyway, I believe this process will remain protracted with little chance of reaching transitional elections within the timeframe allowed by the question. I grant some points for the western intervener normative push for hasty post-conflict elections. But am bearish in my 20% prediction of UN-backed elections before 2018.
