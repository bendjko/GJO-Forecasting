After the plaintiff got a bad enough reputation that she no longer could find a new sucker, er, lawyer, it was trivial for me to win a judgment againsther. I see something  similar in Waymo v Uber. Delay strengthens Waymo as Uber's management troubles proliferate and the reality of Uber's overall criminality becomes clearer. Delay long enough, and Uber's reconstituted management will settle. Or else Uber will implode, which would clear out one of Waymo's most serious competitors. Indeed, this lawsuit is an excellent vehicle for ferreting out Uber's deep dark secrets, and for inspiring Federal prosecutors to go after it and its managers. One factor that could play into delays: self-driving cars have been over hyped.  As forecasts from the executive suites have been falling short, engineering realities have come to the fore.

But no, Uber's biggest problem is still its culture of dishonesty -- something the leadership change hasn't fundamentally altered. The October 2016 cyberattack was not the only one Uber tried to cover up under CEO Travis Kalanick. Last year, the company was fined for failing to disclose a 2014 hack. In the more recent case, the company merely paid hackers $100,000 -- ostensibly for not using the stolen data, but really for their silence. There are numerous examples of a deceitful culture at Uber, from the use of the Greyball software, which made it difficult for law enforcement officials to book rides, to the surreptitious tracking of iPhones in violation of Apple's terms of service. More examples keep coming out. On Monday, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission fined Uber $8.9 million for not running proper background checks and letting dozens of people with felony convictions and driver's license issues ferry passengers around. The background check issue is chronic: It's at the heart of the London transportation authority's decision to lift Uber's license. Uber has pretended to go along with requirements but often neglected to do it in practice. All this, Khosrowshahi would have us believe, is now a thing of the past. \"While I can\u2019t erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,\" he wrote in a press statement after the hack disclosure. But how much has really changed?  The hack admission was the result of an investigation by a law firm hired by Uber's board, which is trying to minimize the company's legal problems. It wasn't an internal investigation. Uber couldn't have swept its results under the rug. Khosrowshahi has published a new, vegetarian set of the company's cultural norms (\"We are customer obsessed... we celebrate differences... we do the right thing... we value ideas over hierarchy\") -- but in his preface to the publication, he mentioned the limits of his overhaul: \"Rather than ditching everything, I\u2019m focused on preserving what works while quickly changing what doesn\u2019t.\" \"What works\" appears to include fighting prolonged legal battles in which Uber is clearly in the wrong, on principle if not necessarily in the legal sense. Instead of complying with the requirements of London regulator Transport For London, Uber is still pursuing an appeal against its license ruling in the courts. The process, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, could take \"years\", allowing Uber to keep operating without a license -- not the kind of responsible behavior that's covered by the new cultural norm that says Uber seeks to \"harness the power and scale of our global operations to deeply connect with the cities, communities, drivers and riders that we serve, every day.\" It was clearly wrong for Uber to hire engineer Anthony Levandowski from Google affiliate Waymo and pay $680 million for his just-created self-driving truck start-up: Both decisions only made sense if Levandowski could bring over his Waymo work. Uber actually fired the engineer in May, and he's refused to testify citing his Fifth Amendment rights. But Uber is still fighting Waymo in court rather than admit that it had tried to cheat in order to jump ahead technologically. It won't even settle the case and \"do the right thing\"; instead, it's clearly doing \"what works.\" In another sign that the company hasn't changed much, Khosrowshahi, like Kalanick before him, won't admit that Uber is a transportation company rather than a tech \"platform\" -- the key issue in a European Court of Justice case brought by a Spanish taxi lobbying group that didn't take kindly to Uber's attempts at regulatory arbitrage. But Khosrowshahi's biggest business move so far -- the plan to buy 24,000 self-driving Volvos, more than $1 billion's worth -- shows the company's insistence that it's an app-based marketplace is no more than a ruse. If it owns the cars and the technology needed to operate them, it's very clearly in the transportation business. And, in some parts of the world, Uber has already bought cars. In Singapore, this practice, combined with the company's trademark contempt for safety rules, led to an Uber-owned car's catching fire with a driver inside. But, instead of admitting the obvious, Khosrowshahi is content to keep defending the \"platform\" claim. Uber, already under Khosrowshahi, fought to the bitter end in a London arbitration case, in which two drivers insisted they were really employees, not independent contractors picking up orders on a \"platform.\" That ended in defeat -- but Khosrowshahi didn't come out with any plan to provide more protections for drivers in the U.K. or elsewhere. Instead, Uber announced the Volvo deal, showing the company would rather replace the drivers -- whom it still calls \"partners\" in promotional material -- with robots. Essentially, doing \"what works\" was Kalanick's approach, too. Continuity is usually good for business, but not in Uber's case. Complete honesty and openness -- about the business model, the relationship with \"partners,\" the origins and functions of technology used, the old (and possibly new) cover-ups -- would be costly but transformative and also potentially life-saving. As it is, Uber continues to run the risk of ending up like Enron, a company brought low by the same kind of dishonesty that still runs in Uber's veins.

A federal judge threw out a key trade-secret theft claim in the Alphabet Inc.\u2019s unit lawsuit alleging that one of its former engineers schemed with the ride-hailing giant to steal critical know-how. The judge also rejected a technical analysis by one of Waymo\u2019s expert witnesses. In addition, he dismissed one of the defendants in the case, which will put more pressure on Waymo to prove that Uber itself engaged in misconduct independent of whether the engineer misappropriated proprietary information. Legal experts said they can\u2019t read too much into the judge\u2019s ruling narrowing the list of trade secrets to be presented to a jury to eight from nine because many of the court documents describing the details of each secret are sealed from public view. The dismissal of the one claim won\u2019t reduce the $1.86 billion in damages Waymo is seeking because that figure is based on a different trade secret. Waymo was originally pursuing 121 separate claims but was ordered by Alsup to whittle them down to keep the case from becoming unwieldy. Otto Trucking\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup said in a ruling late Thursday that Otto Trucking, a startup founded by the engineer at the center of the case, Anthony Levandowski, is no longer a co-defendant with Uber. Alsup noted that Waymo didn\u2019t name Levandowski as a defendant in the case in order to pursue arbitration separately with him and keep the fight with Uber in public court, and must stand by that decision. \u201cHaving made and benefitted from its strategic choice to not name Levandowski as a defendant, Waymo may not renege and suggest that Otto Trucking -- or any other defendant -- is somehow a stand-in for Levandowski, or that misappropriation by Levandowski is somehow automatically transmogrified into misappropriation by Otto Trucking,\u201d he wrote. A spokesman for Uber said the rulings point to Waymo\u2019s \u201cever-shrinking case.\u201d \u201cAfter dropping all their patent claims, Waymo has now lost one of their most important trade secret claims -- and the court has seriously questioned the credibility of the expert they are relying on to support their remaining claims,\u201d spokesman Matt Kallman said in an email. Waymo said in an emailed statement its inspections of Uber\u2019s devices, photos and digital drawings show Uber is using Waymo\u2019s trade secrets and copied its LiDAR designs \u201cdown to the micron.\u201d \u201cOur case has always been principally against Uber and Ottomotto, and we look forward to presenting our evidence on multiple trade secrets at trial,\u201d Waymo said, adding that Alsup allowed for the possibility that Otto Trucking may have to abide by future court orders blocking use of its technology. Ottomotto was formed by Levandowski and later acquired by Uber. No. 96\nThe trade secret that was cut, identified as No. 96, is described as a schematic for a printed circuit board used to transmit light in the company\u2019s LiDAR system, the laser-radar technology which helps driverless cars navigate obstacles and one another. Waymo was also relying on the secret to buttress its claim that Uber colluded with Levandowski, an important connection in its narrative of how the theft transpired. Waymo had told Alsup in August that No. 96 was contained in the 14,000 computer files that Levandowski took before he left the company in January 2016 and later joined Uber as the head of its driverless car program. \u201cOut of 14,000 files, we narrowed it to this one schematic,\u201d Waymo\u2019s lawyer, Jordan Jaffe, told the judge during a hearing. The judge personally examined the schematic, according to the filing. \u201cIt became readily apparent that the schematic in question included hundreds of components and specifications with no clue as to what part thereof might be considered trade secret information,\u201d the judge said. Waymo\u2019s Claims\nAlsup has grown increasingly critical of Waymo\u2019s case since it was filed in February. Last month, in an order rejecting the company\u2019s bid for access to Uber\u2019s source code, the judge said Waymo was \u201cwrong\u201d in its assumption that he postponed the trial so the company could root out and add new trade-secret theft claims to its suit. \u201cThe apparent strength of Waymo\u2019s claims has deteriorated as this litigation has progressed,\u201d Alsup wrote. He said he was granting a brief delay, from Oct. 10 to Dec. 4, because Uber had stalled in turning over evidence and Waymo deserved an \u201cattempt to shore up its case.\u201d Technical Expert\nLevandowski isn\u2019t a defendant in the lawsuit. But after Waymo portrayed Levandowski in its complaint as the central culprit in a massive theft of sensitive data, Uber was ordered by the judge to wall him off from working on the LiDAR technology in dispute and then fired him in May. Levandowski has mostly stayed silent during the litigation, asserting his constitutional right against self-incrimination, and isn\u2019t expected to testify at the trial. Alsup also criticized the analysis of Waymo\u2019s technical expert, Lambertus Hesselink, which Uber argued should be excluded from the case to avoid \u201cmischief.\u201d The Stanford University electrical engineering professor\u2019s analysis amounts to \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d Alsup said. Little precise detail is known about Waymo\u2019s trade secrets, or how they relate to one another, because they are discussed behind closed courtroom doors and described in redacted court filings to protect their confidentiality. Jim Pooley, a Silicon Valley-based trade secrets lawyer who has followed the case, said \u201cyou can\u2019t say in the abstract that nine trade secrets are better than eight, or it\u2019s a real problem if you only have seven.\u201d \u201cMost plaintiffs would rather go in with as many arrows in their quiver as they could possibly be allowed so they can have one or more of them make the mark,\u201d he said.

Shane often speaks to the lessons learned from the aforementioned experiences on his Culture Hacker podcast, and frequently at summits hosted by various Fortune 500 companies. When it comes to culture, every successful startup needs to have that moment when they realize that how they operate is just as critical as what they do. Uber is not just successful; it is the most valuable startup in history. So, whether Uber likes it or not, the company bears a responsibility to start doing things the right way. It's safe to say that Uber has not only reached that point, but rather driven right past it. The Situation at Present Travis Kalanick has relished the opportunity to stick it to the establishment (who hasn't?), but there was absolutely no excuse for him doing the same to his employees by promoting a toxic atmosphere and mindset. His recent play (as ex-CEO) to appoint new board members is the latest antic born from a brilliant entrepreneur desperately trying to protect his power and relevancy within the company he built. I get it, he wants to (and should) remain a central part of Uber, but this type of undermining continues to highlight his lack of concern for the brand as a whole. More importantly, his behaviors are negatively affecting the culture of the company, the morale of its employees and they undermine the actions of Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi. In contrast to Kalanick, Khosrowshahi is a well-respected business leader who proved himself during his tenure at Expedia, so expectations are high that Uber finally has an executive who can lead the company beyond all its recent crises. Immediately after his first all-employee meeting, the signals out of Uber connoted a commitment to change. Internal Strife The dichotomy of moods within this company right now is staggering. In London, on one hand, Uber drivers are arguing for better treatment and pay from Uber in the London courts, while simultaneously criticizing the transportation regulators who revoked Uber's license. This love-hate relationship is also evident at Uber's corporate offices as well\u2014where employees enjoy the role they play in the company's success, but hate the fact that they need to do so in such a draining manner. In both instances, whether with full-time or contracted staff, Travis's approach has placed the people responsible for the company's success under extreme stress, and you simply cannot run an organization in that manner. If your people aren't happy, they will not take care of customers, will look for ways to leave, be less productive, and ultimately hurt the performance of the organization. As Zappos's CEO, Tony Hsieh, so brilliantly put it, \u201cthe brand is just a lagging indicator of culture.\u201d So if Uber is going to keep putting its people under stress, its brand will continue to be damaged and its value will continue to fall. Next Steps This need for Uber to get its cultural act together, and the task at hand for Dara, is reflected in a recent conversation I had with Scott Solombrino, President & CEO of Dav El/Boston Coach and co-founder of the National Limousine Association. Solombrino said, \u201cUber's treatment and classification of drivers is a moral and legal issue on a global scale. These men and women are ultimately responsible for the company's success, yet their wages are not livable, and they are not benefitted as stipulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The core of any company's culture is truly exposed by the way in which it treats its employees, and if the treatment of its drivers serves as an indicator, this core is absolutely rotten.\u201d Simply put, Uber must focus internally first before they can expect to go public. So, where does Uber go from here? First, it starts from within, and it needs to start at the top; which means stopping all the power moves in front of your employees and the public and focusing on what really matters: the culture of your company. Next, the company should continue to invest in, and build out a concerted human resources team with the expertise, empowerment and courage to be a haven for employee concerns, and the facilitator of the new Uber culture. One of the most damaging revelations to come out of Susan Fowler's claims regarding sexual harassment is that Uber human resources did not provide any protection or safety for herself or other employees when things went wrong. Liane Hornsey, a former Google executive, was hired by Uber back in January as its HR chief to begin the process of rebuilding the Uber HR team and reshaping its company culture. She must be provided the resources and ability to grow her team and discipline. Following HR's revamp, Uber must implement all of the suggestions from former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder's report. Some of Holder's most important suggestions focused on company values that define how people should act and interact with others, and how decisions should be made. The company also needs to drastically narrow its focuses and prioritize them during this transition. The key is to assign four core values, and for each of those values, identify two or three behaviors that are observable and measurable. Values cannot be just some philosophical tenets that tick the box for improving corporate culture. For this shift to be real, Uber must call out the behaviors it expects from everyone, and then be willing to recognize those individuals who embrace them. A Bright Future? The beautiful thing is, change doesn't mean that Uber has to lose its hard-charging, entrepreneurial edge. Far from it, as other successful companies like Google, Southwest Airlines, Zappos, and Airbnb have shown us, you can disrupt your industry without disrupting your employee base. Once a cultural base is established, it'll be time for Uber to rework its selection process and think about hiring people who will properly convey its refreshed image. Next, it must revamp the orientation and onboarding process so a proper immersion of the brand, values and customers is delivered. Many cultural revolutions make the mistake of focusing on employees when, in fact, this is the group that evolves most easily. For Uber, board members, executives and managers must show the change they expect of others; or they should be replaced \u2026 plain and simple. In the end, there is too much at stake for Uber not to get its act together. Investors eager for the company's initial public offering will quickly look to get back the value that has been lost over the past six months; and while this may seem best done by focusing on its drivers and processes, don't forget that it also means Uber starting to treat its brand and people with more respect. mr. green is correct"], [6303, "2017-10-31T02:45:40Z", [0.81], "Based on general news and GJP consensus."], [15621, "2017-10-30T12:50:32Z", [0.4], ""], [28414, "2017-10-30T08:43:59Z", [0.47], ""], [28414, "2017-10-30T07:14:43Z", [0.5], ""], [2965, "2017-10-29T22:55:50Z", [0.0], "Please see reply to @Anneinak "], [691, "2017-10-29T20:27:22Z", [0.76], ""], [27367, "2017-10-29T18:51:35Z", [0.78], ""], [38, "2017-10-29T17:26:16Z", [0.82], "Uber  has hired a new top legal officer who will begin working next mont.

Lyft (Alphabet) a fight for the ages\nSee \n\"The future of the ride-hailing industry depends on the capricious largesse of two internet billionaires on opposite sides of the globe. Alphabet Inc.'s Larry Page just backed Lyft Inc., while SoftBank Group Corp. chief Masayoshi Son is set to take a big stake in larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. Alphabet unit CapitalG led a $1 billion investment in Lyft on Thursday that valued the No. 2 U.S. ride-hailing company at $11 billion. SoftBank is expected to put a fresh $1 billion into Uber, and spend billions more buying shares from existing investors. It wasn't always this way. In fact, it's a stunning role reversal. Masa and Larry seem to be leaving the dance with each other's dates. Four years ago, Alphabet's venture capital arm co-led a $258 million investment in Uber when the company was worth about 4 percent of its most-recent $70 billion valuation. David Drummond, Alphabet's chief legal officer, sat on the board. The investment -- which back in 2013 was shockingly large -- came when Uber was just beginning to evolve from a black limo business into the globe-spanning, law-bending transportation network it is today. Alphabet had made a prescient bet and seemed to have picked a winner in a market made for monopolies or at least duopolies. Uber hired a string of top Alphabet executives including Brian McClendon, Amit Singhal and Rachel Whetstone. But the alliance withered and then turned ugly over a technology that could transform the ride-sharing business and transportation more broadly. Page gave Uber the cold shoulder when the startup's co-founder Travis Kalanick tried to partner on self-driving cars. So Uber launched its own autonomous vehicle project. Any amity that still existed evaporated in August 2016 when Uber announced that it was purchasing Otto, an autonomous trucking company run by former Alphabet self-driving car employees. That month, Drummond officially left Uber's board -- even though he'd stopped attending meetings many months prior. In February 2017, Alphabet sued Uber for stealing its autonomous vehicle trade secrets. Now Lyft is more a part of Page's autonomous ride-sharing vision. When Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs unit proposed building a new digital district in Toronto, it mentioned Lyft three times and Uber once in the plan it submitted. Alphabet's Waymo and other autonomous vehicle tech companies will help deploy a fleet of \"taxibots\" and \"vanbots\" and \"existing ride-sharing providers, such as Lyft, would be welcome,\" Sidewalk Labs said.  Masayoshi Son's switch is arguably even more dramatic. Before wooing Uber in recent months, SoftBank had invested billions of dollars in the following ride-sharing startups: Didi in China, Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.  By 2015, SoftBank had formed an anti-Uber alliance that earned nicknames like DKGLO (which stands for Didi Kuaidi, Grab, Lyft, and Ola). There were partnerships and cross investments. Didi invested $100 million in Lyft that year. Lyft and Didi were going to partner up. It seemed inevitable that SoftBank would join team Lyft, and Son even hinted he was interested earlier this year. Yet Son's highest-profile ride-hailing bet, Didi, had already struck a truce with Uber. In August 2016, Uber took a 17.5 percent stake in Didi and walked away from the Chinese market. The enemy of SoftBank's friend was no longer its enemy. Meanwhile, Uber and SoftBank both made a new rich mutual friend -- Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. That vehicle is the biggest backer of SoftBank's $93 billion Vision Fund and wrote the largest check so far to Uber. Now, SoftBank is set to take two Uber board seats, assuming the deal crosses a few more hurdles. SoftBank's Ron Fisher and Sprint's Marcelo Claure have been discussed as two potential board members. CapitalG's David Lawee joined Lyft's board.

Depending on the breadth of the investigation, reported earlier Wednesday by Bloomberg, executives or engineers whose testimony is critical to the trial may choose to assert their constitutional right against self-incrimination and refuse to testify. Typically the target of the investigation would request a delay and the court would consider putting the trial on hold, according to attorney Jim Pooley, a Silicon Valley-based trade secrets expert who has followed the case. \u201cEverything grinds to a halt in the civil litigation while waiting for the outcome of the criminal case,\u201d he said. Any request for a delay due to the criminal investigation would likely come from Uber or its co-defendant Otto Trucking, a startup founded by Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the heart of the case who pleaded the Fifth Amendment at the outset. Levandowski isn\u2019t named as a defendant in the lawsuit. A decision to halt the civil case would be up to U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, who last week postponed the trial until Dec. 4. The reason for the delay was to give Waymo more time to evaluate a 2016 report commissioned by Uber to vet its hiring of Levandowski. A criminal probe isn\u2019t completely surprising, given Alsup asked federal prosecutors in May to investigate the claims in the case. That said, most of the pretrial information sharing and testimony has already been exchanged by both sides in the civil litigation, which may allow a criminal investigation to proceed without interfering with the civil suit. Both Uber and Otto Trucking last week opposed delaying the trial, which may also indicate executives at the companies feel they have little to fear from testifying. The effect on the civil case of an outcome in the criminal case depends on how much of a \u201cmatch\u201d there is between the allegations in each, Pooley said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that criminal charges can be based on a mere attempt to misappropriate, or a conspiracy to misappropriation, while in general a civil case requires an actual misappropriation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that there could be a guilty finding in an \u2018attempt\u2019 criminal case, with little effect on the civil case.\u201d The criminal investigation by federal prosecutors into Waymo\u2019s claims is the second shoe to drop, Pooley said. He cautioned that so far, it\u2019s only an investigation, one step of many in the process that could potentially result in charges being filed.  \u201cThis is not the second of two shoes -- it\u2019s many shoes, and they may decide not to proceed,\u201d he said, referring to prosecutors.\n~~~~~~~\nCOMMENT:  I'm learning a lot about our legal system through researching this question.  It hadn't occurred to me that the civil case might be delayed because of the criminal one.  I'll be watching to see if Uber asks for a delay, and how Judge Alsup responds.  I thought that the judge was pretty clear that the trial would not be delayed again when he changed the start to Dec 4th.\n"], [15621, "2017-10-12T05:58:42Z", [0.55], ""], [40616, "2017-10-10T19:07:54Z", [0.8], ""], [918, "2017-10-10T02:39:46Z", [0.45], "As the case between Waymo and Uber is proceeding toward a trial (jury selection begins Oct. 10), there is less chance of an out-of-court settlement by Uber benefiting Waymo.

Will Oliver/European Pressphoto Agency\nBy Amie Tsang and Michael J. de la Merced\nTravis Kalanick staged a power play at Uber late last week, and a showdown with the company\u2019s board could come as soon as Tuesday.\nHere\u2019s what happened.\nThursday: Uber and an investor, Goldman Sachs, made a proposal to the board that would reduce Mr. Kalanick\u2019s voting power at the company.\n\u2022 The plan also expands the powers of the chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, and pushes the company toward an initial public offering in the next two years, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Eric Newcomer.\nFriday: Mr. Kalanick filled two board seats that he controlled, adding Ursula Burns, the former C.E.O. of Xerox, and John Thain, the former C.E.O. of Merrill Lynch. He said that was a response to the proposal.\nKatie Benner and Mike Isaac, NYT:\nMr. Kalanick\u2019s actions were \u201cdisappointing,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote on Friday in a letter to employees that was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnyone would tell you that this is highly unusual.\u201d\nStill, Uber directors are reluctant to oppose the new board appointments, people briefed on internal discussions told The NYT.\nThe context\nUber is trying to finalize a deal with SoftBank of Japan to let existing investors cash out. (Goldman is working on that plan.)\nWhat\u2019s next\nUber\u2019s board is scheduled to discuss the voting rights proposal on Tuesday.\nMore from Bloomberg:\n\u201cI hope nobody puts this into a model of good corporate governance,\u201d said Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors. \u201cBut they\u2019re dealing with a specific problem in any way they can, and the problem is excessive power for the former CEO, who has the potential to undermine the authority of the new CEO. So I am pretty sympathetic to them.\u201d\nOn the radar\nBloomberg: Mr. Khosrowshahi will meet on Tuesday with London\u2019s travel regulators, who have declined to renew the company\u2019s license to operate in their city.\nFacebook: Congress\u2019s Inquiry and a Blocked China Critic\nCongress\nThe company said on Sunday that it planned to turn over more than 3,000 Russian-linked advertisements to congressional investigators on Monday.\nMike Isaac and Scott Shane, NYT:\nFacebook has yet to disclose the types of advertisements and content the company will hand over. But news reports have linked the posts to issues such as religion, race, gun ownership and other politically charged topics.\nChina\nThe company has blocked the profile of Guo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire who lives in exile in New York and has described deep corruption among the families of top Communist Party officials.\nAlexandra Stevenson, NYT:\nThe social media network said it had blocked a profile under Mr. Guo\u2019s name and taken down another page associated with him. Facebook said the content on both pages had included someone else\u2019s personal identifiable information, which violates its terms of service.\nA Facebook spokeswoman didn\u2019t identify who had made the complaint about Mr. Guo.\nThe big read\nNew York: \u201cDoes even Mark Zuckerberg know what Facebook is?

But the Republican proposal may not give them that reassurance.\nAlan Rappeport, NYT:\nThe ability to pay for the tax cuts matters because of Senate rules requiring legislation that adds to the federal deficit after a decade to expire. If Republicans can\u2019t show that a long-term tax cut will be deficit-neutral, they will have to scale back the size of the corporate tax cuts, make them temporary or find another way to pay for them.\nThe prominent economic pessimist David Stockman, a director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan administration, said Wall Street was \u201cdelusional\u201d if it believed the plan would pass.\nWhat Mr. Stockman told CNBC:\n\u201cThis is a fiscal disaster that when they [Wall Street] begin to look at it, they\u2019ll see it\u2019s not even remotely paid for. This bill will go down for the count.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin thinks the rise in the price of value stocks is about to end. From his note on Friday, \u201cFade the value rally\u201d:\n\u201cImproved prospects of fiscal stimulus and a rebound in interest rates have contributed to a rotation to value from growth ... We expect growth stocks will outperform given our forecast of modest G.D.P. growth and limited upside to oil prices.\u201d\nThe Latest in Picking the Next Fed Chair\nPer Michael C. Bender, WSJ:\nThe contenders President Trump has met so far: Jerome Powell, a current Federal Reserve governor; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor\nAlso in the running: The current chairwoman, Janet Yellen; John Taylor, a Stanford economist; John Allison, the former C.E.O. of BB&T Bank\nMore from The WSJ:\nThe search for a new Fed chairman has been largely informal until now. Several White House officials had described the shortlist of candidates as existing only in Mr. Trump\u2019s mind. But the president has started to interview candidates in recent days, one White House official said.\nEvercore ISI analysts on Friday: \u201cKevin Warsh would be a great leader.\u201d Their reasoning:\n\u2022 Probably no one in the (credible) policy-making world is more philosophically opposed to the existing regime/leadership.\n\u2022 He\u2019s not a believer in rigid central bank \u201cindependence.\u201d\n\u2022 He would work a lot more in concert (or at least have a closer relationship or dialogue) with the fiscal authorities.\nEvercore ISI\u2019s bottom line: \u201cThink more Greenspan, less Bernanke/Yellen.\u201d\nBut the NYT\u2019s Kate Kelly warned over the weekend not to draw too many conclusions from the interview process: \u201cFWIW, the fact that Warsh got first known interview w Trump doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he is the front runner.\u201d\nWhat Catalonia Means for the Markets\nThe euro was knocked down on Monday as investors kept an eye on the Catalan independence referendum, which was marked by violence and left hundreds injured.\nBut fallout for the broader markets is expected to be limited for now.\nEsteban Duarte and Maria Tadeo, Bloomberg:\n\u201cThe developments in Catalonia sent the euro lower in early trading, but is unlikely to cause wider negative effects on European asset prices,\u201d said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cWe could see euro drifting lower especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve acts on their hawkish rhetoric and tax reforms in the U.S. gather momentum.\u201d\nThere could be more uncertainty ahead, especially if the Catalan government unilaterally declares independence.\nThe New Establishment, 2017 Edition\nVanity Fair\u2019s latest list is out.

If the Uber-SoftBank deal gets done, it may be one for the record books. With $10 billion changing hands, it could be the largest private stock sale ever. The people involved might remember it for a different reason, however: as the most contentious deal they've ever done. Even calling it the \"Uber-SoftBank\" deal grossly oversimplifies the situation. There are four major players, along with a largely powerless investor base. Those four parties are Uber, SoftBank and its fellow investors, Travis Kalanick and an investor group led by Benchmark. All four players have different objectives and price isn't even the central stumbling block. Here's my best sense of what they all want. Travis Kalanick The co-founder and former chief executive officer wants to keep the door open for some involvement at the company, though it's hard to tell exactly what role he wants. He's fighting against Uber's largest shareholder, Benchmark, in court to maintain control of three board seats. So at the very least, he wants to hold onto his outsized role over Uber's board of directors. Kalanick and Uber's new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi are in regular contact and Kalanick seems at peace with the fact that the company has a new chief. That said, Kalanick understands the company better than anyone and he knows it. It's hard not to see him wanting at least an advisor role. How does this fit into the SoftBank deal? Well, the central stumbling block for the deal is over the company's governance \u2014 the board composition, the voting power of shares, etc. Benchmark and its investor group have pushed for terms that would expressly prohibit Kalanick from becoming CEO again or from ever becoming the company's board chairman or even chair of one of the board's subcommittees. SoftBank has made verbal commitments to restrict Kalanick's power, but said in a statement that it hasn't agreed to \"contractual limits.\" Kalanick would certainly like see Benchmark leave the board and its role at Uber. Uber Khosrowshahi needs to bring order to his company. He'd like a peace accord between feuding shareholders. He'd like to make sure existing employees get a chance to sell some of their shares at a fair price. Khosrowshahi and Benchmark would like to see the company's voting structure move closer toward one share, one vote, but doing so would diminish Kalanick's influence over the ride-hailing company. I think Khosrowshahi is also well aware that if SoftBank doesn't invest in Uber it could easily head over to San Francisco's China Basin and invest in rival Lyft. Or SoftBank could continue to pour money into Uber's foreign competitors. If Uber is able to get SoftBank as an investor, it could open the door to a truce with SoftBank investments Ola or Grab. Benchmark The firm wants to diminish Kalanick's role in every way possible and this deal is one vehicle to do so. It's hard to get an honest read on who really wants to sell. Benchmark would sell a percentage of its stake under certain conditions \u2014 if it gets guarantees that Kalanick will not be placed into certain leadership roles at the company and as long as some other governance reforms are made. If so, the firm would sell some of its shares at Khosrowshahi's direction. SoftBank, Dragoneer and General Atlantic The buyers care about getting a good price. (Right now it seems like the secondary deal might start around $45 billion.) There's a reason that the deal talks started during a time of crisis. There was blood in the water. Rank opportunism. SoftBank's Masayoshi Son loves a good deal. SoftBank has also said that it wants a substantial chunk of Uber shares \u2014 at least 15 percent. So it isn't just matter of price, but of making sure that enough shares get on the market so SoftBank can take a meaningful stake. But there's one thing everyone wants to know when it comes to SoftBank? Whose side is Masa on? Benchmark's or Kalanick's? \nAnd here\u2019s what you need to know in global technology news This guy just won the video game lottery.

A trade-secrets lawsuit by Waymo, a federal foreign bribery probe and fall-out from sexual harassment allegations are among the legal woes that have depressed shareholders\u2019 investments in the company by 15 percent, according to the complaint. \u201cThe company's vaunted corporate culture was revealed to in truth consist of a toxic hotbed of misogyny, sexual discrimination, and disregard for the law that threatened the company's reputation, business and prospects,\u201d according to the complaint filed on behalf of a Texas city's firefighter pension fund by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP, one of the nation's leading securities class-action firms. The lawsuit adds to the wave of litigation against Uber that continues to spill over from the Kalanick regime onto newly appointed CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. Uber is in arbitration over a complaint filed by investors at Benchmark, which accused Kalanick of duping the firm to gain control of three board seats. The \u201cpervasive pattern of unlawful behavior\u201d at Uber forced Kalanick to resign as CEO in June, resulting in an exodus of high-level employees at the company and \u201cimpairing its business, operations and prospects,\u201d according to the complaint. Among those who've left Uber this year were the company's president and the heads of business, communications, engineering and self-driving cars. \u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P. All rights reserved.

The new CEO Khosrowshahi was presumably hired to sort it out because the board thought that Uber's current operating model was never going to produce a return on investment. It would not be an unreasonable approach for a new CEO to attempt to clear up all the issues that are threatening Uber, these presumably would include dealing with Uber's culture, treatment of staff, treatment of drivers, relationship with public transport regulators and the Waymo case.  Evidence for this is the letter of apology Khosrowshahi has written in relation to Transport for London cancelling Uber's operating permit. \n \u201cWhile Uber has revolutionised the way people move in cities around the world, it\u2019s equally true that we\u2019ve got things wrong along the way.
