Assuming players need at least two weeks to ramp back up after having spring training interrupted and allowing some additional time for health and safety protocols and other logistical issues to be finalized, that may be an ambitious time-table. So if Manfred does as expected and implements that shorter season, then look for a scheduled Opening Day to fall between the middle of July and Aug. 1.

What\u2019s the drop-dead deadline for getting the season off the ground?

Airlines are offering $8k if you contract COVID-19 while flying with them (a rather nice incentive); groceries are delivering like crazy; businesses are figuring out how to get employees tested to rebuild customer confidence. Likewise, my guess is that sports will be able to resume when they apply basic social distancing principles to attendance (maybe sell every other seat, etc).

Victims who succumbed to the pneumonic form displayed none of the boils associated with the Bubonic Plague.\nRelatively recent research has shown that the virulent fast-moving pneumonic form was a respiratory disease... one that initially preyed upon the weak and malnourished, then spread, rapidly, via person to person in close quarters, via discharge expelled from the lung. In 1349, little was known of respiratory disease, close quarters and transmission. The epidemic peaked in the cool months Feb- April 1349 and abated almost as rapidly and virtually disappeared by Pentecost - which in 1349 was 31 May. This may be explained by several factors; warming temperatures, higher levels of Vitamin D, (sunlight) and increased nutrition. Increased availability of meats, fish, fresh fruits and vegetables.
