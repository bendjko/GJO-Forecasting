However, there have been some change in the last few days.   The two most recent polls taken before, and during the South Carolina primary (CBS and USA Today see link below)  have Bernie at 31 and 35 percent, respectively and Biden at 19 and 14 percent ,respectively.  To split the difference, Bernie was at 33 percent and Biden at 16.5 percent.    The last day of these polls was the date of the primary.  I suspect Biden's numbers will rise between 4 and 10 percent more due to the South Carolina bounce. So, let's say his numbers will rise by seven percent to about 23 percent.   Buttigieg and Styers both dropped out.  Buttigieg had about nine percent, and Styer had about 3 percent.  I think between 65 and 80 of Buttigieg's 9 percent  will go to Biden or about 6.5 percent (did that in my head so approx). and between 1/2 and 90 of Styers' 3 percent or about 2 percent will go to Joe.  \nSo Biden gets about 23+6.5+2 or about 32 percent to Bernie's 33 percent,  which makes the race very competitive.

I think the tech industry, business elites, immigrants or children of immigrants will support Bloomberg. I think Michael's stance on immigration reform will attract a lot of voters.

This support will only grow has Bernie is likely going to win Nevada and come in 2nd or 3rd in South Carolina, above other \"popular\" prospects like Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Warren. One should also not forget that Bernie has the highest level of support among Hispanic voters, which is a huge voting demographic in California and will likely propel him towards a victory there.  Warren's support in California has crumbled following her poor performance and the media's new found disregard for her. She will likely stay in the race till Super Tuesday, but her support levels on election day have been fairly consistent with poll projection at around 10%. It is unlikely she will find any momentum in Nevada or South Carolina and therefore will not be able to rally enough support to win California.  Biden's campaign will continue to falter in Nevada and will probably perform below expectations in South Carolina, as recent polls predict. California is also more inclined to vote progressive, so Biden's campaign in California will continue to lose ground to fellow moderates: Klobuchar, Buttigieg and Bloomberg.   Despite Klobuchar's surprise finish 3rd finish in NH, she isn't set up to do well in Nevada or South Carolina, thus her perceived \"momentum\" will be lost going into Super Tuesday, likely keeping her support in the low teens and thereby unable to win California.  The same can be said for Buttigieg, but Buttigieg's support thus far has been underrepresented in the polls and is being pushed and supported by many establishment democrats. Therefore it is possible for him to continue to increase support in California and that moderates start to rally around their \"winnable\" candidate. If so Buttigieg could possibly win California, but if not he will likely split the vote with other moderates.  Bloomberg also faces the same problem as many moderates and the SurveyUSA poll showing him with a surge of support in California should largely be discounted as A. it doesn't provide any margin of error or sample size and B. does phone polling which is far more likely to favor white and older people, as that is the demographic that is most likely going to pick up the phone. These people are more inclined to vote moderate and to watch network television, which has been blasted with Bloomberg adds. come election day, his real support levels will probably be in the teens, especially considering his problematic past which he is going to get blasted on during the debates.
