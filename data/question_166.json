When it ruled on issues of jurisdiction in November 2015, the Permanent Court of Arbitration decided that it had jurisdiction over half of the claims submitted by the Philippines (including claims 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 13), but it reserved consideration of its jurisdiction over the other half (1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 14) until a later date.  The difference between the two sets of claims is important. The first set, which the Court decided it had jurisdiction over, are primarily technical claims over whether specific features in the South China Sea qualify as islands under Article 121(1) and (2) of UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While the Court is likely to side with the Philippines on these claims, doing so will not require them to address China\u2019s 9-dashed line.  The claims that the Court reserved judgement on are far more sweeping, including claim (2), which reads: \u201cChina\u2019s claims to sovereign rights jurisdiction, and to \u2018historic rights\u2019, with respect to the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the so-called \u2018nine-dash line\u2019 are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China\u2019s maritime entitlements expressly permitted by UNCLOS.\u201d I don't think the Court will (a) find it has jurisdiction to adjudicate this particular claim and then (b) find in favour of the Phillipines.   When China ratified the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea it chose to exclude the application of UNCLOS\u2019s compulsory dispute settlement mechanisms for \u201cdisputes concerning the interpretation or application of articles...relating to sea boundary delimitations, or those involving historic bays or titles,\u201d as allowed by Article 298(1)(a)(i). Given this, it seems unlikely the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate claim (2), which deals with historic rights and China's 9-dashed line.

If it's a claim of territorial sea, then it pretty blatantly violates UNCLOS and all pre-UNCLOS international regimes regarding limits on the territorial sea, and accordingly is indisputably invalid, and its age is irrelevant.  It is invalid for the same reasons the similarly old (1946-1950) 200 nautical mile territorial waters claims by Chile, Peru, and Ecuador were and are invalid.  Further, the People's Republic, by ratifying UNCLOS and failing to reserve the territorial claim in its contemporaneous declaration ( http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_declarations.htm#China%20Upon%20ratification ), absolutely surrendered it under international law in favor of UNCLOS definitions.  It would also be inconsistent with the territorial sea claims of the PRC in its own laws. If it's a claim of an EEZ, well, EEZs only were formalized by UNCLOS, which means that the 1947 maps are irrelevant; China could not then claim something that did not at the time exist.  Further, a current claim as an EEZ would be invalid under UNCLOS anyway, since it would go well beyond the plausible limits even if every disputed feature was counted as a Chinese island.  China, by failing to even mention this EEZ claim in its declarations, absolutely surrendered it under international law upon ratifying UNCLOS in favor of UNCLOS definitions. If it's merely a claim to the islands/rocks within that limit (the rocks could then have 12-mile territorial waters but no EEZ, while the islands would have EEZs), then UNCLOS can't apply; it doesn't say what land people can claim.  This interpretation would also be the only interpretation of the nine-dash line consistent with the declarations made by China upon ratification, which was only to \"all its archipelagos and islands as listed in article 2 of the Law of the People's Republic of China\", which includes the Paracel (Xisha) islands, the Zhongsha Islands (of which Scarborough Reef is the largest), and the Spratly (Nansha) islands. I accordingly expect a declaration of invalidity of the line insofar as UNCLOS applies directly, and a ruling that the panel is is incompetent to rule on the validity of the line as a claim to the islands/rocks inside of the line. I also expect that to be scored by GJOpen as the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling the line as contrary to UNCLOS, because those are the only aspects under which UNCLOS would apply to its validity, but I'm adding some uncertainty since I'm not sure that's how GJOpen would score it.
