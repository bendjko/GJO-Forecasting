The virus emerged in the Hubei province of China in December, causing a province lockdown in early 2020. However, Wuhan exited its full lockdown in March, and since then, daily cases totals have been minimal in the country. According to the Chinese, the spread of the virus was fully contained, and 90%+ of the cases occurred near Wuhan, China. Since the first of May, China has been recording an average of 17 cases per day. This data\u2019s trend is somewhat linear, though daily case totals have been slightly higher in the most recent two weeks (due to an outbreak in the capital). If we assume the data to be linear with a growth rate of 17 cases per day, by August 20th there will be 86236 cases in China. The average daily case total since the start of July is 29. If the trend is again linear, with 29 cases per day, China will report 86669 cases by August 20th. In order to report fewer than 86,000 cases by August 20th, China needs to record an average of fewer than 10 cases per day. In the past month there have only been 2 days with fewer than 10 cases (2/30). It is therefore very unlikely, (<1%) that 15 of the next 30 days will have fewer than 10 cases.  In order for China to report more than 88,000 cases, it would need to average 64 cases per day. China has not recorded this many infections in a day since April, making this also extremely unlikely. There is one caveat: since January, the Chinese have been accused of manipulating their COVID-19 case data. Because of the inherent unreliability in Chinese data, we need to account for the fact that past cases could come to light that would drastically increase the Chinese case totals. This happened in March, when probable deaths were added to the country\u2019s death total. It is extremely unlikely that the number would be adjusted down, but it could easily be adjusted up. For this reason, I am predicting a 1% likelihood in more than 100,000 cases.

While there are small outbreaks here and there, the chance of a huge second wave is small, given the measures the country has taken to contain the virus.

HK outbreak seems to be worse than the previous ones. It added 66 new cases today, larger than any one-day addition than the Beijing outbreak. If i'm wrong, this is the most likely surprise factor.\n2. Summer travels are up. People are more and more comfortable travelling.\n3. International flights are picking up so imported cases can increase. However, this should be limited, as requirements for foreign flights are stringent, and flights with more than 5 confirmed cases would be cancelled for the week after.\n4. Second wave? Unlikely, but could have a huge effect on numbers. Reasons for less:\n1. Most schools won't be open by Aug 20.\n2. People are generally cautious, and almost everyone wears a mask when going outside.

This was during the first wave. A second potential wave is appearing in Beijing, Liaoning and Hebei provinces but the results have thus far double digits and no major uncontrolled spread has occured. My prior is therefore 85,400.  Likelihood: Given China's history of aggressive and draconian lock-downs/contact tracing, their experience containing with the virus, increased PPE supplies and medical advancements since the last wave, I believe the likelihood of the second wave being substantial is very unlikely. The low 000s in flare ups seems to have subsided. This example has demonstrated how quickly China can stamp out any potential flare ups, so between now and August, there can be another 3 flare ups (assuming total infected/flare up = 200) with the total infected staying under 86,000. Given that 1 flare up happened in 4 months since the virus was contained (March - PRESENT), I doubt 3 flare ups will happen between PRESENT - August. Therefore, I will put 75% < 86k and 25% 86k-88k.
