That leaves two teams to consider.  There have been surprises in every World Cup, with usually at least one big name failing to reach the knockout stages, and often one African country making it.  Historically, South American countries have rarely done well when the World Cup is in Europe (Brazil being an exception), so Argentina - despite a much higher FIFA rank and 3/19 odds to qualify - may struggle against Croatia (4/7) Nigeria (11/4), and the giant-killers of 2014, Iceland (4/1).
