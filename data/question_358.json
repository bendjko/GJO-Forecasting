UK trade with the EU will not vanish should even the hardest of Brexits occur.  If the EU was foolish enough to put large tariffs on UK goods then they would be shooting themselves in the foot.  History has shown repeatedly that this form of taxing consumers does not help grow an economy and also tends to have an upward pressure on domestic currency and in doing so make their own exports more difficult (contrary to the intent). On the flip-side, inflation in the EU seems to be picking up.  While this may trigger a sovereign debt crisis (negative for EUR), it may also force the ECB to taper it's QE and possibly leave NIRP (very positive for EUR).  Unlike most central banks, the ECB does not have much discretion when it comes to inflation targeting. It's generally accepted that the BoE made a significant policy error by cutting interest rates and resuming QE immediately after the Brexit vote.

Repeat pattern between now and when A50 is triggered. \nUntil Mrs May clarifies the specifics of which categories of immigrants will cease to be admitted to the UK it is a sterile discussion. Mrs May's track record is not very good, as Home Secretary for 6 years in spite of the government having a policy of reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands she made no significant progress in reducing immigration from outside the EU, so why would anyone believe she would reduce immigration from the EU after Brexit? It has already been stated that (a) no one is really concerned with students per se, so they shoud still be welcome (b) well qualified and skilled immigrants will still be welcome (c) farmers, food processors and caterers  have been promised that they will still be able to access a similar number of low skilled, low wage immigrants (d) the problems with the NHS and social care sectors suggest that no one but a fool would not welcome the immigrants that do this work (e) would the UK just block the families of immigrant workers? But actually the goal is answering the wrong question. Research clearly shows that \"net migration\" is not what voters care about. What the concern over immigration is, is where the percentage annual increase in the number if immigrants in a locality is high. It is the rate of increase not the percentage of immigrants. Voters in place with a high percentage of immigrants did not vote for Brexit, places with a low percentage of immigrants, but where the percentage of immigrants was rising fastest did vote for Brexit. I have no heard of anyone living in a Brexit voting area say that if only more Brits would retire to Spain (and so reduce the net number of immigrants to the UK) they would be happy to have the Brits replaced by Romanians. Net migration figures are totally irreverent.  If you can't describe the problem correctly there is little chance of solving it  "], [4634, "2017-01-12T11:05:35Z", [0.02, 0.28, 0.62, 0.08, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-01-12T09:17:24Z", [0.01, 0.53, 0.41, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [23234, "2017-01-12T07:02:09Z", [0.01, 0.46, 0.46, 0.07, 0.0], ""], [32456, "2017-01-12T05:35:58Z", [0.25, 0.35, 0.21, 0.14, 0.05], ""], [28103, "2017-01-12T03:05:52Z", [0.01, 0.23, 0.37, 0.29, 0.1], ""], [11455, "2017-01-12T02:41:26Z", [0.0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.1, 0.0], ""], [12591, "2017-01-11T23:48:38Z", [0.1, 0.5, 0.35, 0.05, 0.0], ""], [691, "2017-01-11T21:52:50Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.72, 0.23, 0.0], ""], [31082, "2017-01-11T21:40:32Z", [0.01, 0.08, 0.9, 0.01, 0.0], "updated to reflect current \u00a3/\u20ac forward curve (1.15)  (e.g. http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/fwcalc-disp# ), with possibility of unexpected drop below 1.1 for brexit development"], [3915, "2017-01-11T21:04:04Z", [0.0, 0.35, 0.55, 0.1, 0.0], "The Economist will prove as wrong in their pound forecasts as they were in their forecasts about Brexit and a post-Brexit economic collapse.

Clearly banks selling bonds in themselves to their own unsophisticated retail customers is a problem. A similar issue occurred during the banking crisis in Spain 5 or 6 years ago, where customers with normal interest bearing deposit accounts at Bankia were persuaded to swap them for higher yields bonds in the bank itself. Many of the customers seems to have thought they were just transferring funds to a different account that would be covered by the EU bank deposit protection scheme (which of course was not the case as they found out when the bank failed). I would have expected that all banks would have been told by their regulators that retail customers needed to warned before they bought Bonds that are not covered by deposit protection. I don't know the situation in Italy but would suspect that there will be a lot of argument between Bond holders, the Italian financial protection authorities, the Italian Government, the ECB , the EU, the EU Parliament and EU countries as to how this question has arisen again only 4 or 5 years after the last time.

I do not think the final Brexit outcome will be much clearer by the end of March. It is quite likely that A50 will have been delayed (the delay blamed on Parliament not accepting David Davis \"Brexit Negocation Position\" paper). If a \"hard\" Brexit looks more likely the pound will fall. If the pound falls too far the government will panic and start talking up a \"softer\" Brexit. If the pound starts to rise significantly the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail will will report that Brexit is creating a boom and that the government can safely go for a quicker \"harder\" Brexit. So I think the \"hard\" and \"soft\" Brexit talk will keep the pound about where it is now. Clearly at the moment markets are assuming that some kind of fudge will take place that will allow the UK and EU trade to continue more or less as it does now for an indeterminate period (at least 2 years, maybe 4 years maybe 10 years). So I guess that means they expect industrial investment (in stuff that cannot easily be moved abroad) to continue to decline, while services and investment continues in IP (that can be moved a click of a button). As long as the UK remains open to highly skilled migrants the legacy of the Brexit vote, whatever deal is struck with the EU, will probably to bring forward the UK exit from the manufacturing economy and speed up the move to the IP economy. Probably not what most Brexit people were hoping for.
