This may or may not be completed before 1 Jan 2020 (probably 90% likely it will not be done before January) but the question is not about an agreement to leave the EU, but an agreement on the future customs status of NI. \nThe customs status of NI does not automatically change when the UK leaves the EU, but it might change when a EU/UK future trade agreement is settled. The time table for a EU/UK future trade agreement is some time after the UK has left the UK, the UK wants that to happen during 2020. Although the UK WA mentions the future customs status of NI what is described lacks legal clarity, and it is questionable if it really answers this forecast. Specifically the UK just saying that NI will remain in the UK Customs territory when NI customs will appear be aligned in both regulations and tariffs to the EU Customs territory does not make sense (except as a political description as something that is actually quite different). This is shown by BJ claiming that no Customs checks between GB and NI will take place, and his ministers and trade experts saying that checks will have to take place.  It would seem that no customs checks between NI and GB would only be possible if the GB customs territory and EU customs territory had the same rules and tariffs.  \n"], [14237, "2019-12-14T17:01:56Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [15196, "2019-12-14T14:01:00Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-14T07:40:28Z", [0.97, 0.02, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [20504, "2019-12-13T21:21:12Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-13T14:37:05Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80422, "2019-12-13T12:33:25Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-13T08:34:47Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [34353, "2019-12-12T15:16:56Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-12T12:52:47Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [38, "2019-12-11T06:37:45Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [41612, "2019-12-11T04:37:06Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-10T19:41:46Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [42004, "2019-12-10T11:02:50Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-09T13:47:42Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-08T22:53:31Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67844, "2019-12-08T16:12:10Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-07T13:39:41Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-12-05T19:09:02Z", [0.96, 0.03, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [80855, "2019-12-05T18:40:26Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [1034, "2019-12-04T21:33:29Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-12-03T20:41:54Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-12-03T12:59:53Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [79569, "2019-12-02T19:41:28Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [14237, "2019-12-02T01:30:23Z", [0.99, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [534, "2019-12-01T18:33:15Z", [0.95, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-29T13:57:53Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [67444, "2019-11-29T08:08:20Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-28T14:24:05Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [25141, "2019-11-28T12:41:49Z", [0.98, 0.01, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [78343, "2019-11-27T10:53:37Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1034, "2019-11-26T21:41:31Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [1333, "2019-11-26T19:14:02Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [691, "2019-11-26T18:46:42Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [15471, "2019-11-26T13:03:11Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.03, 0.02], ""], [691, "2019-11-25T14:42:35Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [62808, "2019-11-23T02:21:11Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-21T14:36:08Z", [0.95, 0.03, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [80560, "2019-11-20T16:53:49Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [20504, "2019-11-19T21:17:57Z", [0.98, 0.01, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [32300, "2019-11-19T12:56:12Z", [0.96, 0.03, 0.0, 0.01], ""], [32300, "2019-11-19T12:55:28Z", [0.93, 0.03, 0.0, 0.04], ""], [534, "2019-11-16T19:57:11Z", [0.85, 0.1, 0.03, 0.02], ""], [1333, "2019-11-16T14:12:39Z", [0.94, 0.04, 0.01, 0.01], ""], [691, "2019-11-15T16:29:34Z", [0.93, 0.04, 0.0, 0.03], ""], [49596, "2019-11-14T09:19:08Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [62808, "2019-11-13T23:25:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [80506, "2019-11-11T15:40:51Z", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [691, "2019-11-11T15:29:51Z", [0.91, 0.06, 0.0, 0.03], ""], [14237, "2019-11-10T21:30:36Z", [0.14, 0.01, 0.0, 0.85], ""], [35217, "2019-11-09T12:35:29Z", [0.87, 0.11, 0.0, 0.02], ""], [79104, "2019-11-07T22:11:36Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [66692, "2019-11-07T07:08:49Z", [0.98, 0.02, 0.0, 0.0], "I don't think this will get any further before the end of January at the very earliest."], [63674, "2019-11-07T01:29:10Z", [0.94, 0.01, 0.0, 0.05], ""], [6978, "2019-11-06T20:20:39Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Fin."], [67317, "2019-11-06T17:56:13Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Dead horse.

If they are baffling the EU then I feel no shame in  being baffled as well but I my previous comments were far from clear so I am having another try at clarity. First point is I am pretty sure this will not be sorted out by 31st Oct. There is some chance (20%? 10%) that BJ and the EU may have agreed something by 31 Dec. But whatever BJ and EU could agree will probably (60% to 80%) to rejected by the UK Parliament because it will appear to cross the red lines of one group on MPs or another. So that would seems to suggest that a \"Yes\" could be somewhere in the range 2% to 12%.  The problem I then have is that none of the possible \"Yes\" answers seems to fit the options offered to this question.  The way the media are reporting what they believe BJ is asking for is for NI to be legally be in the UK Customs territory, but administratively in the EU Customs territory.  I don't expect the media to be particularly careful to only use legal definitions of terms like Customs Territory, but if the normal meaning of a Customs territory is as per the wikipedia entry below \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_territory\nits hard to see how NI could be considered to be legally in the UK Customs territory if it has different rates and rules to the rest of the UK, and there are checks and tariffs on trade between NI and GB. This is like calling a horse an elephant.  There seems a better logical case for saying that NI would be in the EU Customs territory if it has duties and rules that lined up with those of the EU and it had no checks on moving goods across the border. The problem with this option is that it seems that for political reasons BJ cannot say that NI is remaining in the EU Customs territory. If the UK Government explicitly say that NI is NOT going to be in the EU Customs territory, but there is some new type of relationship between the EU and NI its a bit presumptuous for forecasters to argue that the UK Government is wrong and that NI is in the EU Customs territory. This is the equivalent to there being two horses, but BJ is calling one of them an elephant.  We seem to entered Alice's Wonderland where words mean whatever you want them to mean. Anyone else got any ideas how this question should be answered? Should we follow the wikipedia definition of a Customs territory, or what BJ seems to want it to mean?  If we decide that NI would remain in the EU Customs territory in spite of what the UK Government calls the relationship, do we have accept that NI is in the UK Customs territory because BJ chooses to claim it is, when according to the normal meaning of the term it is not?

Legally as I understand it the EU Customs territory and the NI Customs territory would have a Customs Union, but they would each be separate customs territories. In the same way that Turkey is not part of The EU Customs Union (a customs territory for EU members only) but has has A Customs Union between Turkey's Customs territory and the EU. Technically there is a difference between the EU Customs Union that has FTAs with 3rd countries like Canada and Japan and the EU/Turkey Customs Union which has no FTAs with 3rd counties.  So my understanding is that if NI were to be fully aligned with the EU regarding customs it would not legally be located in the EU's Customs Territory, but would have a Customs Union with the EU's Customs Territory as Turkey does. But if NI had different tariffs to the remainder of the UK it would also not be in the UK Customs Territory either.

How likely is this? I have not seen the full legal text, but the summary released says that the NI Parliament would need to agree to some of the conditions (regulatory agreement with EU rules in some areas) while these conditions are not the customs territory I would think that the deal as a whole would depend on all parties agreeing all of the conditions. As a consequence of NI having regulatory alignment presumably NI would still come under the European Court of Justice, while the remainder of the UK does not, it appears to me that this would make NI substantially different to the rest of the UK.   \nAs the NI Parliament  (NI Assembly) has not been operating since March 2017 I would assume that the NI Assembly needs to be up and running again in order to agree to the BJ proposal. \nThe reasons the NI Assembly is not sitting are to do with the odd way that that it operates. It requires power sharing and consensus to operate and can only agree to anything if consensus exists. This appears to mean that under BJ's proposal any group in the Assembly can refuse to agree to the regularity alignment either at the start of the WA or when it comes up for renewal every 4 years. As its well known that the DUP does not want regulatory alignment with the EU long term it can't be assumed that the consensus would exits to renew this after 4 years even if it were agreed now. The DUP have said they will go along with the BJ proposal. But having the DUP agree to regulatory alignment now is is not the same as it being agreed by the NI Assembly (obviously the DUP is only one political party not a NI Government) so I would think that as a minimum the NI Assembly would need to be up and running to agree to BJ's proposals. If the NI Assembly or a NI public vote do not endorse BJ's proposal I would think that citizens would have a good case of making a legal challenge that changing the relationship between NI and the rest of the UK (and the EU) without the consent of the people was against the Good Friday Agreement, the UK constitution, and their human rights.  The steps needed to get everything sorted out before 1st Jan 2020 seem to be next to impossible. I doubt that BJ's proposal will the accepted. In my view its far too complicated to converted into a watertight legal text in a few weeks. Most agreements start from the assumption that all parties wish abide by the spirit of some easily described concept which has mutual befits. Bj's proposal is starting from the assumption that BJ will do what ever it takes to find loopholes and ways to avoid inconvenient details in whatever is signed because he does not agree with the spirit  Defining what EU law applies to food and goods is not a trivial matter as many EU rules apply to not just the goods but the means of producing the goods, transporting the goods and selling the goods, and many goods include services and many services include goods, and labour and environmental rules are part and parcel of the EU system. Some UK MPs are saying they will vote for BJ's proposals as long as other parts of the WA are also changed.

There's not too many cases of customs agreements being decided in the aftermath of a state leaving a customs union while also possessing a disputed territory. In a case such as this with little precedent, what can often be helpful is looking at the signals of the actors and how they choose to posture. By comparing this with the history of an actor following through (or not) with its signalling, we can draw a rough estimate for a situation such as this. Theresa May, currently the Prime Minister of a Tory Party in the midst of a civil war, has stated openly that she will not accept a backstop deal for Northern Ireland. Indeed if any customs agreement crystallizes out of the negotiations it will likely be one that will include both countries. Any other option would be too difficult for either side to argue, and in the stalemate that has evolved out of Brexit negotiations, is unlikely to develop anywhere anytime fast (certainly, it would not be feasible within the timeframe of this poll)\nThe chance that no backstop is reached is also somewhat difficult to sell to hardline Brexiteers who see it as a way for the EU to essentially work through an Irish loophole. \nAs it is the UK is in less of a position to argue right now. Many of Theresa May's former statements and promises have proven to fall flat, and with the Irish question the potential political risks outweigh the cries of the hardliners. Past negotiation failures have put Britain in a bad position and especially after the most recent postponements something as large as this will need to be extensively worked out, and no decisive action is feasible. https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-may/separate-customs-territory-for-northern-ireland-unacceptable-pm-mays-spokeswoman-idUKKCN1N7192\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/18/how-the-irish-backstop-emerged-as-mays-brexit-nemesis\nhttps://www.politico.eu/article/uk-cant-escape-irish-backstop-with-no-deal-brexit/"], [72399, "2019-04-18T20:08:51Z", [0.6, 0.25, 0.14, 0.01], ""], [72394, "2019-04-18T17:35:25Z", [0.6, 0.08, 0.12, 0.2], ""], [67444, "2019-04-18T14:02:19Z", [0.64, 0.1, 0.01, 0.25], ""], [24440, "2019-04-18T00:54:26Z", [0.2, 0.15, 0.05, 0.6], ""], [49838, "2019-04-18T00:32:30Z", [0.1, 0.13, 0.1, 0.67], ""], [14493, "2019-04-17T10:51:09Z", [0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05], "An issue that has not been considered by many in the UK: Pelosi (Speaker of House of Respresentatives) gave a speech in Dublin saying that if the UK did anything that damaged the Good Friday Agreement then forget a UK US Trade Deal. The \"anything\" would I believe mean if NI did not stay in the EU Customs Union/Single Market then the US House would not approve a UK US trade deal. Pelosi seems to have numbers to do this. This seems to make it difficult for the Free Trade Brexiteers to have any good argument for Brexit, as their whole pitch was that outside the EU Customs Union/Single Market the UK would be able to do hugely beneficial FTAs. As the US and EU make up half the worlds trade, if you cannot do do a FTA with either who are you going to trade with? In my view this could be as big a wake up as Suez in 1956. Then the UK, France and Israel invaded Egypt to stop it nationalising the Suez canal (which was owned by Britain and France). The UK and France did not get prior agreement from the US. After the three countries defeated Egypt the US threatened to ruin the UK economy by selling all its UK bonds if the UK did not immediately withdraw. The UK was humiliated and this event \"signified the end of Great Britain as one of the World's Great Powers\". If the US takes a similar strong line the over Good Friday Agreement and the Irish Border. then the UK would be forced to keep NI in the CU/SM. NI in the CU/SM while the rest of the UK was outside is unacceptable to most UK politicians. The whole UK inside the CU/SM would make Brexit pointless to most Brexiteers. So another UK humiliation, another signal that the UK is not a world power. The alternative would be to do what the UK used to do and build strong alliances so that it appeared strong thanks to these allies.        https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-pelosi/harm-to-irish-peace-accord-would-prevent-u-s-uk-trade-deal-post-brexit-pelosi-idUKKCN1RR20F\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis"], [72106, "2019-04-16T18:42:33Z", [0.25, 0.02, 0.15, 0.58], "No is a proxy for the extension of the Brexit deadline to 2020 (delayed Brexit or no Brexit) - possible\nUK customs territory means hard borders - very unlikely given the political fall-out and parliamentary opposition\nEU customs territory means UK has no say - no UK party in favour\nNew territory is the most likely compromise - supported by Labour, less damaging to Conservatives than other options"], [72103, "2019-04-15T23:42:34Z", [0.99, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01], "I am betting there actually will be no Brexit, something will give.

The only way to keep the Conservative Party together is for NI and Great Britain to be in one Customs territory. That leads to the whole UK being in the same Customs territory as the EU because the UK government will not agree to a border between the two parts of Ireland or between NI and GB. \nIf A50 had been extended by a year or more there would have been time to get rid of Mrs May, and for the Conservatives to appoint a new PM and re-think how they were going to deal with Brexit and to arrive at a workable solution. \nThe Conservatives are unlikely to try and replace May while local elections, and then EU elections are taking place (\"vote Conservative - we are throwing out our leader\" is not a vote winner.) So any new PM is not likely until June or (more likely) July. \nA new PM would presumably need a little time to come up with a Brexit plan, but my belief is that the only type of Brexit that would get support from a majority in parliament (it needing cross party support) would involve the UK staying in the EU Customs Union. As staying in the Customs Union is not what the hard Brexiteers want and not what Remainers want, I think that parliament would only support this option if the public endorsed it. So to vote thru the WA would require a commitment to a new public vote before the WA was activated. Endorsing it with a public vote would take at least 22 weeks. Even if a new PM was minded to go down this route, unless the new PM was in place in May there would be insufficient time to do this before the end of October. Which presumably means to do this would require the EU to extend A50 for longer. The most likely outcome is that the public would not endorse the version of Brexit proposed and the UK would remain in the Customs Union, if the public did endorse the Brexit proposal the UK would also stay in the Customs Union. But I don't see it happening because the A50 end date would get in the way of a public vote.\nSo as far as I can see the only ways that the question could be resolved (except as \"No\") by the end of 2019 would be by Revoking A50.

In my opinion the best tactics would be to first eliminate or at least show you want to eliminate the worst outcomes. So that was fine they did that by showing they did not want No Deal in the first batch of indicative votes. But to get want you really want you have to vote FOR some kinds of Brexit. They need to vote for the least bad forms of Brexit, to show that soft Brexit is the most popular form of Brexit and the only version of Brexit that parliament would support in the hope that the government (and EU and parliament) reject Hard Brexit as being less popular and undeliverable. Once \"a Customs Union\" or \"Common Market 2.0\" become the front runner, the argument can be made that this needs to be negotiated with the EU, so extend A50. Then when the negotiation on soft Brexit has been completed and this deal is brought back to parliament the case for holding a confirming Public Vote can be made. A good case can be made then that a soft Brexit was not what many Leave voters wanted so they might now want to vote against it and so can the Leave voters.

The populist press, which only sells papers if they reflect the views of their readers is also demanding that the government get on with Brexit. So there will be a lot of pressure on MP's to speed up the process. Events over the last week show that Conservative MPs are running out of patience with Mrs May's \"kick the can down the road\" way of working and there is almost no appetite for allowing Mrs May to continue with whatever Brexit process emerges between now and 12th April. So it seems almost certain that whatever happens (May's version of Brexit gets through parliament - unlikely but possible; a no deal Brexit - almost impossibly; the UK keeps talking to the EU and takes part in the EU parliamentary elections - the most likely outcome) Mrs May will cease to the PM by mid-summer (and probably a lot sooner than that) and the UK will therefore have a new PM, who will be under a lot of pressure to resolve the most complex parts of Brexit quickly. Part of the most complex part of Brexit (along with the Single Market) is the Customs Union.  I see the only option on the Customs Union question that is capable of a relatively quick agreement between the EU and UK, is to remain in the existing Customs Union. Any alternative (different) version of a Customs Union between the EU and UK would  by its nature require a longer more complex period of negotiations. As the average voter has little idea what the difference between A Customs Union and THE Customs Union is and cares even less it seems to me that talk of A Customs Union is likely to be dropped. While questions of Custom Unions might excite a few voters there are a lot more voters who just want to \"get on with it\".  So when (as is looking almost certain) talks between the UK and EU start in October 2019 I expect it will be agreed within a few weeks that in order to solve the Irish Border Issue the Future Trade will have to include being in the Customs Union (and they will probably agree that the UK will have to be in the Single Market at least as far as goods and aquaculture is concerned).  If anyone is interested in my view of the Common Agriculture and Common Fisheries policies I would say that it would be optimistic to expect the UK to be able to leave these aspects of the EU and retain free trade on food stuffs with the EU. If there is no free trade in food with the EU, its difficult to see how the open frictionless border with the EU could work. It seems logical to me that to have an open border all goods have to be tariff free and legal on both sides of the border. If any product is subject to a different regime on the other side of a border you need to have physical checks on that border to stop smuggling. If you need to have the same conditions on either side of a border, you need to give producers either side of that border a level playing field. The Common Agriculture and Common Fisheries policies ensure a level playing field for producers. If one party has a different system then it obviously becomes much more difficult to have a level playing field (e.g. if the UK used a different subsidy system the playing field is unlikely to be level). Note: I am not saying that the CAP or CFP are great or that they should not be changed, just that any system in the UK would need to match the system in the EU.

The question is how long it will it need to be extended by. Unless Mrs May's Deal passes through parliament before a A50 extension period is agreed Its difficult to see how a short extension would be long enough. If May's deal is voted through then a 3 or 4 month extension would be possible, but  as May's Deal contains very little of a Future Trade Agreement Framework it is very likely that it will take several years to produce the FTA. If May's Deal is not approved by the UK Parliament the alternatives would probably be a lot less bespoke (e.g. a Norway+ type deal) which it is possible to turn into a agreement fairly quickly. However Mrs May is certainly not minded to go down that route, and it is likely that any deal other than May's current Deal would not emerge until after political eruptions in the UK in which one or several of these events would take place;- a change of PM, a public vote on the deal, months of stalemate, a general election, a Citizens Assembly to consider the options.   I can't see how any UK EU trade agreement that honored the Good Friday Agreement with Ireland is possible that does not end up with the Single Customs territory that includes both the EU and UK. The UK, EU and Ireland all say they will honor the Good Friday Agreement. The Good Friday Agreement guarantees that there are no checks or infrastructure on the NI Ireland border. An agreement to continue to have the EU and UK in a single Customs Territory is (almost) certain the only question in my mind is when the agreement will be delivered.   With the EU busy with Parliamentary Elections and changes to the Commission, it is difficult to see how EU/UK trade talks are likely before October 2019. Its seems very unlikely that anything but the simplest deal could be adopted by the end of December 2019.\nOther outcomes are possible. The UK Parliament could Revoke A50 or a referendum that has the option of Remaining could take place and A50 could be revoked by the UK.

If parliament had approved the deal the arguments about the Irish Border, Customs Union and Single Market would have dragged on for years. By not approving the deal it becomes more likely that by the end of this year a new and clearer Future Trading Relationship will have been agreed. One reason for thinking it will be agreed this year is that all parties are getting tired of Brexit and are looking for a way to settle matters. In order to do that parliament is likely to force the government toward a clearly defined Brexit that is based on existing legal entities, rather than a totally bespoke trade deal (based on having cake and eating it). By far the most likely form of Brexit would be one in which the EU and UK remained in a single customs territory. In fact the Norway+ (Common Market 2.0) looks increasingly likely. (George Freeman MP today estimated that a majority of MPs would accept that type of Brexit).\nWe should find out next week what support among MPs for each type of Brexit there is. \nThe public is going off the idea of Brexit altogether (YouGov poll 16th Jan 56% would prefer to Remain in the EU vs 44% still want to Leave). The impasse between May and MPs is likely to become even clearer in the next couple of weeks, and a PM who is out of step with her cabinet, her MPs and parliament can only end in one of two ways; either the PM is seen as bravely standing up for the people, or the PM is seen as stubbornly blocking those who want to resolve the impasse.

Alternate routes are a lot further on congested rural roads. \nIf expanding capacity at other ports will be needed post Brexit, not only do the ports need to be rebuild but the UK's road network needs to be rebuilt. \nI hope the Brexiteers have factored in the all the infrastructure costs."], [56, "2019-01-01T08:26:09Z", [0.9, 0.0, 0.05, 0.05], ""], [34353, "2018-12-31T14:16:20Z", [0.55, 0.05, 0.05, 0.35], ""], [691, "2018-12-31T12:58:31Z", [0.42, 0.1, 0.01, 0.47], ""], [60463, "2018-12-31T11:44:49Z", [0.75, 0.05, 0.05, 0.15], ""], [1333, "2018-12-29T22:40:19Z", [0.45, 0.25, 0.05, 0.25], ""], [1333, "2018-12-29T22:33:52Z", [0.35, 0.25, 0.15, 0.25], ""], [44308, "2018-12-28T15:49:45Z", [0.5, 0.2, 0.0, 0.3], ""], [691, "2018-12-28T13:24:42Z", [0.33, 0.1, 0.01, 0.56], ""], [28103, "2018-12-26T22:45:18Z", [0.33, 0.2, 0.05, 0.42], ""], [31450, "2018-12-26T16:43:28Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "Seems to me that this is the hardest part of the existing Brexit negotiation.

Since the Brexit deal would come with the backstop agreement, and I assume in that case the question would resolve as \"a single customs territory...\", I arrive at 50% as a bit less than 65% for that bucket. The almost equally probable scenario I see as no agreement before the end date. I don't see an agreement to have Northern Ireland on UK custom territory only within the time frame, because there would need to be some major marketing for this solution.

To do this really mean getting rid of the GF agreement and that would be a major problem.\nThe EU CT only would cause significant domestic political problems. many Leave voters and MPs would hate to make NI and Ireland closer than NI and GB would be. If NI was allowed to have a different post-Brexit relationship with the EU then Scotland would demand that they also remain in a Customs Territory with the EU.\nMrs May likes to kick the can down the road. If her Brexit deal gets through Parliament or not the fact is that no post Brexit trade deal negotiations has yet started. Because of EU elections its unlikely that any serious future relations negotiations will start before October 2019, which is not time to have an agreement by 1 Jan 2020.\nIf Mrs May is replaced (or parliament takes control) it is looking as if a referendum will almost certainly be needed so that voters can chose what Brexit outcome they want. It is quite possible that a referendum could take place by October 2019 and that (going by current opinion polls) the most like result would be to Remain in the EU or possibly to remain in the EEA+Customs Union. In either case the UK would remain in a Single Customs Territory with the EU. \nI think its close to 100% likely that the outcome will be the Single Customs Territory, the doubt is when that would be agreed.  My feeling is that May (and Corbyn) will try and delay the inevitable most other people will try and get Brexit resolved. So far May has succeeded in avoiding taking any decision so I would not rule out that she will cling on and drag it out for another year.

The alternative would be that NI elects to join Ireland and as such the EU. There are a number of technical questions for this question:\n- How will a no-Brexit scenario be scored? I assume as No\n- How will a Brexit-in-name-only scenario be scored? I assume as \"in both\", but could also be \"in EU\" (if UK doesn't get its own customs zone)\n- How would the May-deal be scored? I assume as \"in both\" And fundamental questions:\n- Will that be decided in 2019 or will it drag out longer?\n- What are the wishes of the UK government?
