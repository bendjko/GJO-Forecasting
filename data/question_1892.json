In 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed between Iran and several world powers, including the US, during the Obama administration. The JCPOA is more commonly referred to in the US as the \u201cIran Nuclear Deal.\u201d Since the US withdrew from the agreement in 2018 under the Trump administration, Iran has restarted various activities related to nuclear programs (Robinson).  With the transition to the Biden regime, both the US and Iran have expressed willingness to re-engage in negotiations, or at least, to dialogue. During press briefings provided by the US Department of State during the first week of March, Department Spokesperson Ned Price discussed negotiations with Iran, stating that those in the US administration \u201cremain ready to re-engage in meaningful diplomacy to achieve a mutual return to compliance under the JCPOA commitments\u201d (Price). In Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s first speech of 2021, he focused on the JCPOA and emphasized the need to lift sanctions, but rejected possible talks on Iran\u2019s missile development and regional activities (\u201cIran File\u201d). Backing up this position, on March 4, 2021, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted that \u201cJCPOA cannot be renegotiated,\u201d and that countries should \u201cget down to implementing JCPOA \u2013 which we both actually signed on to\u201d (@JZarif). In February 2021, Iran announced it will place new restrictions on the IAEA\u2019s ability to conduct inspections of its facilities. However, some of the restrictions will not take effect for three months, a window of time that analysts say could be intended as an opening for diplomacy (Robinson).  A lethal military conflict between two major parties of the JCPOA would almost certainly derail the negotiations that both sides have expressed a willingness to approach. Given the opportunities for Iran to obtain relief from sanctions and a resumption of foreign aid, and the looming Iranian Presidential elections in June 2021, it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to engage in military conflict with the US at this time. If the Obama administration\u2019s policies are indicative of what Biden\u2019s may be, it seems more likely that Biden will approach Iran with bribes, rather than bullets. As there are only 11 days until the end of the time period in this forecast, I think there is nearly no chance of a lethal confrontation taking place.

However, I think it is likely the Iranian forces will attack US bases in the area again in the near future.  Recently on March 3rd, there was an attack carried out on the Ain al-Asad airbase in Iraq. No one has claimed responsibility yet for the attack, but considering the attack came from the east of the base, the finger seems to be pointing towards Iran. I had to google where the base was, and since it's not technically on the map due to protection, I was unable to find the exact location. Thankfully, Military Auto Source likes to market itself as best as possible, so they have successfully given a roundabout position of where the base most likely is. One contractor died from a cardiac \"episode\" while hiding during the bombing.  This kind of attack is the typical tit for tat that occurs in this area and will likely continue. Khamenei has also been very vocal recently about retaliation against the United States. He called it a \"slap to the face\" of Americans and also said, \"military action is not sufficient, what is important is that the seditious American presence in the region must end.\" If this is the kind of vocalization being passed to the people of Iran, then I expect this to become more of a conflict. If the time span for this prediction were longer, then I would raise the percentage. The Iranians are also still very upset about the bombing of Soleimani in January of 2020. To them, the United States killed a very influential leader. It would be similar to if the Iranians took out General Petraeus.

American show of force following Iran suspected attacks could spark an official retaliation from Iranian military forces.  \u201cThe flight by the two heavy bombers came as a pro-Iran satellite channel based in Beirut broadcast Iranian military drone footage of an Israeli ship hit by a mysterious explosion only days earlier in the Mideast\u201d (Gambrell 2021).   Many run-ins with Iranian backed forces have been militia groups, which do not fall under the parameters of this question.

Iran denies involvement in these attacks, making it unlikely that an outright military confrontation would occur between U.S. forces and Iranian armed forces in Iran or at sea before March 15th.

Tensions between the US and Iran definitely rose during Trump's time in office, stemming from actions such as withdrawing the US from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 and the assassination of Qasem Soleimani in 2020. With the new administration, many are hoping for a shift in dynamic between the two countries; however, with the Biden administration joining European partners in an effort to begin talks with Iran for the first time in several years to settle differences and revive the 2015 nuclear deal, as well as the recent attacks on US bases in the Middle East and Biden's decision to strike Iranian-linked groups in Syria in late February, it is uncertain whether relations between the US and Iran will worsen or better in the following months. But the US and Iran are in a very precarious situation right now, with both sides avoiding a direct military confrontation, instead attacking each other through the US imposing economic sanctions, Iran targeting US allies (such as Saudi Arabia and Israel), and both engaging in conflict through Iranian-backed proxy forces (like Ketaib Hezbollah). These conflicts have mostly occurred in other countries, specifically Iraq, making it even less likely that there will be a confrontation between the two within Iran or at sea. If any lethal confrontation were to occur in the next two weeks, it will be an attack on a US base by Iran-backed militants or a US strike against Iranian proxies, but there is a very low chance that there will be a lethal military confrontation between the national military forces of Iran and the United States military either in Iran or at sea.

Iran has recently refused offers from the European Union to engage the United States directly in talks regarding a rejoining of the Joint Cooperative Plan of Action, levying a requirement for the US to alleviate economic sanctions prior to such a conversation.  Some believe Iran is looking for an opportunity to avenge the January 2020 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani, with Iranian judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi going as far as to say their revenge is \u201cclose at hand\u201d during a meeting with Faiq Zidan, Head of the Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council in Baghdad.  If Iran were to conduct an attack against US forces on land, it would likely continue to leverage a proxy-force such as the Kataib Hezbollah as they have in the past, reducing the chances the US would retaliate with an attack across the Iranian border.  Kayhan, a hardline Iranian media outlet, recently cited unnamed \u201cmilitary experts\u201d in crediting Iran with an attack on the MV Helios Ray, an Israeli vehicle carrier, off the coast of Oman, indicating probable Iranian capability and intent to execute such attacks against perceived threats.  The US Naval Institute indicated that as of 1 March 2021, the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) is currently located in the Persian Gulf, providing a possible, albeit incredibly well-defended, target for a potential attack such as seen with the MV Helios Ray.  Two factors inhibit this option for Iran; first the attack would be highly unlikely to be successful against a large group of US naval ships sure to be on alert in their current geographic location and secondly the political ramifications Iran would suffer if their direct involvement were discovered could see the loss of support from the European Union, causing further economic hardships for the country.  Based on this information, I cannot completely rule out the chances of either the US or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps suffering a fatality at sea over the next two weeks, but it is extremely unlikely.

Conflict between Iranian proxy forces (primarily Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah) and U.S. military forces in Iraq occurs several times each year.  However, retaliatory strikes remain confined to forces stationed inside Iraq.  Iran also routinely seizes and sabotages foreign ships transiting the Persian Gulf.  However, I found no evidence of Iran targeting U.S. military or civilian vessels.  In 2019, Iran did shoot-down a U.S. RQ-4 flying near its border, however, this does not qualify as a \u201clethal\u201d confrontation as the RQ-4 is unmanned.  Both the U.S. and Iran seem to recognize that attacking one another\u2019s forces inside Iran or at sea is a significant escalation neither side is willing to make. In the last two weeks, both Iran (Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) and the U.S. (President Biden) made statements expressing their desire to renew the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), AKA the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.  This will be a several months-long process, during which both the U.S. and Iran will seek to avoid unnecessary conflict. The most likely source of lethal confrontation will come from strategic miscalculation or provocation from elements of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) not strictly adhering to rules of engagement.  For example, on 15 April 2020, eleven IRGS fast attack vessels harassed six U.S. vessels conducting a training exercise in the Arabian Gulf.  While neither side exchanged warning shots, the IRGC ships came within 10 yards of U.S. vessels.  This tactical-level provocation could have easily resulted in a lethal confrontation.  While the probability of this is higher than an exogenous event, it is still very low.  I found three similar incidents of IRGC maritime \u201charassment\u201d over the past four years, for a rate of one per year.  The probability of a similar incident occurring before 15 March is 1 in 6, or 16%.  However, there is no precedent for one of these incidents turning lethal.

One pending issue the potential of Iran to remove IAEA inspectors in late February due to a parliamentary law passing in December.
