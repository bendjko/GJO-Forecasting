I could not find a further breakdown to just Europe, but I will assume at least 2/3's of the revenue came from Europe.  If so, only about 10 percent of total revenue came from Europe and of course, less came from just the UK, maybe three to eight percent of Ubers' total revenue. However, the EU just introduced a bill reclassifying all EU Uber and Deliveroo drivers (a company Uber and Amazon use to make deliveries) as employees.

With this in mind and the $39.86 current stock price, I am going to decrease my expected value and move the chances of LT $75B and $75B-$100B upwards while decreasing the chances of $100B-$125B even. Still 4.5 months to go which can drastically swing a price, but the Delta variant continues to weigh on the nation.

I lean bearish on Uber for many reasons right now primarily the competition in self driving cars and their lack of demand over the past year but also how expensive rides have been recently, lack of supply, and general macro trends (delta, etc.).  OTOH possibility of continued reopening.  I do expect Uber to have a better year compared to last, I do not anticipate it being anything near 2019 levels.

Shares Outstanding for Uber are approximately 1.87B and I don't think that will necessarily change before we get to December - though I'd be interested in why it did if they do end up diluting or buying back shares. So taking all that into account, we are somewhat trying to predict the market price of an Uber share as of December 2021. To give everyone an idea of what prices would need to be for each level:\n$75B - $40.11\n$100B - $53.48\n$125B - $66.85\n$150B - $80.22 Looking at the indices that hold UBER, we see that the Vanguard Total Market and Vanguard Extended ETF are some of the larger ones, holding around $500M between them. So one major disruption to price would be Uber's inclusion in the S&P 500 index which would require a TON of different places to buy shares and thus send the stock skyward- very, very unlikely. We also have to wonder about the overall market health in December. I think we are seeing a period of stagnation where there are no major economic disruptions on the horizon, but that always means we have to be aware that a major event like COVID could still happen even at an extremely low rate. Uber is a stock that should do better when times are good because people are more willing to take rides and go places. Anyway, Uber hit a 5-year high on 2/12 at 60.63 and they peaked near that a couple times after that at 60.35. I'm pretty sure we will see fluctuations in the price, but the most likely scenario given the current data is that it hovers somewhere around where it is now."], [100653, "2021-06-03T13:06:28Z", [0.2, 0.28, 0.24, 0.16, 0.12], ""], [94499, "2021-06-03T08:07:24Z", [0.1, 0.42, 0.38, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [94499, "2021-06-03T07:39:14Z", [0.1, 0.36, 0.44, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [97892, "2021-06-03T00:22:43Z", [0.0, 0.05, 0.74, 0.21, 0.0], ""], [88569, "2021-06-02T20:38:03Z", [0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.09, 0.01], ""], [97892, "2021-06-02T01:34:45Z", [0.0, 0.03, 0.64, 0.33, 0.0], ""], [55987, "2021-06-01T15:22:23Z", [0.04, 0.38, 0.51, 0.06, 0.01], ""], [27661, "2021-06-01T10:01:06Z", [0.03, 0.48, 0.47, 0.02, 0.0], ""], [100896, "2021-06-01T09:47:31Z", [0.15, 0.55, 0.25, 0.05, 0.0], "There is a risk that inflationary pressure will push up borrowing costs and for growth stocks this will push down the share price.

En Chile, para Julio-Agosto de este a\u00f1o, debiesemos tener cerca de un 70% de la poblaci\u00f3n vacunada. Esto claramente incidir\u00e1 en la libertad de las personas, permitiendo mayor movilizaci\u00f3n luego del fin de las cuarentenas y la vuelta a la vida \"normal\", y por lo tanto, mayor uso de apliciones como Uber.\nEs por esto, que creo que ser\u00e1 muy poco probable que su capitalizaci\u00f3n baje con respecto a la actual, sabiendo que todo apunta a que se termine el coronavirus. Tiene muchas posibilidades de aumentar, debido a que si todo funciona correctamente con el virus, Uber podr\u00eda seguir con el crecimiento que viene desde fines del a\u00f1o pasado (cerca de un 50%). Tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda mantenerse por que a\u00fan hay mucha incertidumbre mundial en muchos pa\u00edses, con las vacunas, nuevas sepas, y todo tipo de cosas que puedan hacernos volver a las cuarentenas, pero ir\u00edan compensando los pa\u00edses que no est\u00e9n confinados."], [100600, "2021-04-17T18:48:40Z", [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.4], "Seg\u00fan el sitio macrotrends (https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UBER/uber-technologies/market-cap), el cual ilustra gr\u00e1ficamente la capitalizaci\u00f3n de Uber en el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o, actualmente uber capitaliza alrededor de 100 billones de d\u00f3lares, lo cual representa casi el doble de lo que se logr\u00f3 en diciembre del 2020. Es imposible para m\u00ed no hacer el v\u00ednculo de estos n\u00fameros con el porcentaje de vacunaci\u00f3n que existe hoy a nivel mundial contra el Covid-19. Podemos tomar la muestra de Estados Unidos, pa\u00eds que ha tenido un buen desempe\u00f1o en cuanto este tema, lo cual representar\u00eda un escenario mas bien optimista en comparaci\u00f3n con la situaci\u00f3n mundial. Adem\u00e1s, Uber se encuentra presente en este pa\u00eds desde hace alrededor de 12 a\u00f1os, entonces podemos utilizarlo como ejemplo.  Haciendo pron\u00f3stico sobre el nivel de vacunaci\u00f3n que tendr\u00e1 EEUU en Julio por ejemplo, si se mantiene al ritmo actual (casi 25% en 4 meses aprox.), podr\u00eda haber un 50% de la poblaci\u00f3n completamente vacunada, lo cual definitivamente significar\u00e1 cambios en la libertad de movimiento de las personas en el pa\u00eds, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan en diciembre de este a\u00f1o.

The IPO set the valuation at about $82 billion. The market cap on Dec 31, 2019, saw that number shrink when Uber had a market cap of about $51 billion following a decline in the stock post-IPO. The first half of 2020 saw a massive decline in the stock down to a low of $14. However, the second-half rebound has shot the stock up to all-time new highs. The closing market cap for 2020 saw Uber pass its initial valuation with a market cap of about $89 billion. That has since grown to right around $104 billion currently. The daily market cap average since the IPO has been about $65 billion, so it would appear Uber is currently trending up.  What is driving the higher share prices? First off, Uber saw a strong rebound in its rideshare bookings in the second half of 2020. This seems to have given new life to the company. However, it appears Wall Street is more interested in some of their other segments. Their delivery segment was particularly strong in 2020 and outpaced its competitors. The purchase of Postmate and Drizzly seems to have positioned Uber to remain a market leader in goods delivery post-pandemic. Additionally, the company is exploring new delivery segments to get involved in. Finally, Prop 22 in California has seemingly taken some of their labor issues off the table in the short-run giving Uber a sigh of relief in a large market.  Wall Street seems extremely Bullish on the stock. A 40 Analyst survey had 32 Bullish, 6 Neutral, and 2 Bearish. Deutsche Bank has raised its price target to $80 (the highest of the bunch) for 2021 which would put the market cap at   $144 billion. That number seems a bit high, although attainable if they continue to see the growth of the last few months. The average target price right now appears to be about $61. That seems to be more reasonable. I think they have a 69% chance to hit a target price of $55-69, putting the cap at the $100-125 billion. I think there is a 13% chance the stock falls below $55 and a 17% chance the stock eclipses the $69. I think moving about the $80 target this year seems unlikely.

It doesn't. It's self driving R&D has been a shambles. It has little or no hope of being able to develop the tech to do that. Tesla and the others are so much further ahead.
