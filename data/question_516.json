My understanding of the situation in Nigeria is that it is not so bleak for either side. The government is not able to put forth a massive front that would eliminate Boko Haram, decreasing any concerns of the latter about total annihilation being imminent. For Boko Haram to exterminate large amounts of civilians would turn the population from suffering under its control to actively resisting it (a la the FARC and the AUC in Colombia in the 1990s). Conversely, Boko Haram does not present such a threat that the Nigerian government would eschew international standing to indiscriminately kill civilians on a massive scale for an ambiguous end goal.
