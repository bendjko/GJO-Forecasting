My starting point is that any legislation that gets signed will include a repeal of the individual mandate. This is something that all republicans and Trump can agree on. So the question becomes will any legislation be signed? Trump and Ryan need to get this done in the 100 day time period. Trump desperately needs to be seen as keeping his promises and Ryan needs to show is effectiveness as a leader. Countering this is the desperate need of Republican Congress members to get reelected in 2018 or 2020 and the present bill includes outstanding ammunition for the democrats to use against them.   If negotiations lead to a bill that satisfies the more conservative members then it will surely include provisions that would put any republican legislator in a swing state or district in a precarious position. If negotiations lead to a bill that helps those in the swing states then it will lead to a right wing media blitz and put some conservative republicans at risk of a well-funded primary challenge. Repealing without replacement could be done but that has the same problems for any Republican up for re-election.

In addition, he also now seems to be intimating that while the repeal may be in one fell swoop, the replacement components may be crafted in some sort of piecemeal fashion thereafter. This interpretation is a major change in my thinking in that it removes the problematic necessity of having a complete set of alternatives available at the time of repeal. This also seems to be a change in direction from the path that I had previously interpreted Paul Ryan to be on (repeal and replacement simultaneously). This is at least how I interpret the comments from Spicer in his 22 February press conference. So, will the first of two budget reconciliation packages occur before 30 April, and, if so, will it contain a repeal of the relevant Obamacare provision? My current thinking is 30% on the first question and 50% on the second, thus increasing my current forecast +5 (from 10 to 15). Edit/Update: Having just seen ex-Senator Jim DeMint, now associated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, echo the same thing as Spicer (paraphrasing: \"American healthcare was the best in the world prior to Obamacare, so we should just simply repeal Obamacare and start any reforms from the base of that pre-existing system\"*), I am convinved that this change in approach (which I believe it to be) is at least a trial balloon, and possibly even a commitment to change in direction by the administration/GOP (at least the conservative wing thereof). I am surprised that the MSM, however, did not jump on Spicer over this apparent change in approach yesterday at the press conference, so maybe I was wrong to believe the the previous approach was simultaneous repeal/replacement; although I do admit to being under that general impression. *I infer that the Spicer and DeMint messaging is co-ordinated because they both made the exact same claim, using nearly identical words, as justification; viz., the pre-existing  American healthcare system prior to Obamacare was \"the best in the world.\""], [33941, "2017-02-23T09:26:27Z", [0.27], ""], [14033, "2017-02-23T03:36:35Z", [0.5], ""], [32521, "2017-02-23T02:57:22Z", [0.0], ""], [12268, "2017-02-22T23:34:33Z", [0.0], ""], [368, "2017-02-22T21:06:01Z", [0.0], ""], [26748, "2017-02-22T19:22:25Z", [0.16], ""], [32521, "2017-02-22T19:00:12Z", [0.85], "The house is planning to present and debate this in March.

Trump's court. So any bets about whether or not legislation will be signed (Pres. Trump is almost certain to sign such a bill) are actually bets about whether Congress will pass such legislation prior to the end of the hundred days. However, it seems as though Congressional Republicans are only just now engaging with the questions of how this will affect the country, and how to mitigate damage with a more conservative approach. That increases my degree of uncertainty about their ability to pass such legislation. There aren't any meaningful, hard time constraints. Presently, I feel very confidently that they'll repeal the individual mandate within Pres. Trump's first term, but much less so that they'll accomplish it within the first hundred days without an actual institutional constraint.\nTo formalize this, I'll assign a .99 probability to a legislative dismantling of the ACA within Trump's first term. If we break that term into three-month blocks (resembling the roughly three months between now and the end of the hundred days), Congress has 16 discrete time steps in which to pass a repeal. If we treat repeal as an independent event occurring in one of the blocks, each one has a roughly 25% of seeing the repeal. Moreover, Congress' incentive to pass a repeal will follow a U-shaped curve over time: as we move away from the inauguration, doing it soon will seem less important.
