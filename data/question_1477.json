A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view):\nIran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death\nUS: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them.\nThese factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate.\nThe outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability. Update: I'm dropping my probability slightly based on the current international climate (COVID preoccupation) and the likelihood that Iran will avoid provoking the hawk Trump when they could just wait a few short months and test the resolve of the new US President. At the same time, the US is absorbed with domestic issues, and so it's still reasonable that Iran could allow something to happen or it happen inadvertently. Update 12/3/20: I'm dropping my forecast probability slightly to reflect the closing window of time during which a lethal event would have to occur, but not reducing as much as I would if not for the press on: Trump administration taking potential action against Iran in final days in office, the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist allegedly by US ally Israel, and the reported potential for renegotiation of the JCPOA under the Biden administration.

A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view):\nIran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death\nUS: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them.\nThese factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate.\nThe outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability.  Update: I'm dropping my probability slightly based on the current international climate (COVID preoccupation) and the likelihood that Iran will avoid provoking the hawk Trump when they could just wait a few short months and test the resolve of the new US President. At the same time, the US is absorbed with domestic issues, and so it's still reasonable that Iran could allow something to happen or it happen inadvertently.

That being the case, it has been seen as an obvious stoking of tensions in the reason and with the US as it is a breach of international norms and expectations. However, since then, the Trump administration has responded by pushing economic sanctions and sought UN approval in their pursuit, signaling that, at the moment, they do not wish to respond with force. This may change in the future, especially given that the UN is not eager to restart sanctions given that they only recently had to abandon an agreement with Iran due to the American government's sudden withdrawal.

In the eyes of author Tom Doctoroff, China\u2019s bark is worse than its bite and \u201cgiven an adolescent economy and an immature body politic, China must focus on domestic imperatives\u201d (Doctoroff, 2013). It is the job of the analyst to identify any judgmental biases \u201cwhich are often systematic rather than random, in a certain direction\u201d (Kam, 2004). \u201cPrediction is extremely difficult and is likely often to be erroneous, particularly when it refers to international relations and military affairs\u201d (Kam, 2004). Keeping these things in mind when applying logic to this situation and following Heuer\u2019s method of giving the most weight to arguments that compete against the obvious conclusions derived from available evidence, it was easier to identify signal from noise. Relevant variables that could have been overlooked when giving the most weight to the obvious become more noticeable when giving the most weight to the argument. This was of great importance when evaluating this problem set. There is abundant evidence that an engagement of some sort would happen between the PRC and India. If Heuer\u2019s method of giving the most weight to information that weakens a hypothesis had not been applied, an analysis concluding that a conflict was in the future for them may have been reached. However, these hypotheses were easily argued against when the most weight was given to the information that weakened the engagement hypotheses. In fact, these weakening arguments turned into lynchpins, and two out of three lynchpins supported a political outcome. The assessment reached in this analysis is that there will be a political solution to the PRC-India Crisis\" Daveinsea INTEL401 May 30, 2020 Got a 97% on the paper and a 98% final grade in the class.\u00a0\nBUT, I WENT 100% WITH MY GUT HERE ON GJO......

A base rate informed by pre-COVID attack trends between the US & Iran, IMO, must be modified to reflect the COVID context. In which direction? Let's look at the domestic contexts for action (inside view):\nIran: significant COVID infection scandal; poor public opinion of govt; increasingly diminished resources thanks to sanctions, COVID, and oil market crash; continued anti-American rhetoric and warnings; public still smarting over Soleimani death\nUS: bellicose POTUS that responded violently to Iranian provocations/attacks previously; almost 1 million COVID cases; upcoming presidential election; devastated economy; tweets for US Navy to destroy Iranian ships that harass them.\nThese factors could tip the balance in either way (attack to distract, rally around the flag or don't attack bc it exacerbates uncertainty too much). I lean toward the latter--the risk of exacerbating uncertainty will be too high for both governments during COVID, but I think the inside view is mostly indeterminate.\nThe outside view should consider the average rate of attack annually (monthly?) between the US and Iran, the targets of those attacks (are national forces postured at the targets), the accuracy of those attacks (probability of killing a national force) as a rough start point. Based on the calculations of these probabilities by smart people below, I'd say the general base rate is very low, 10-20%, but is elevated in 2020 given the number of attacks that have taken place within the last six months and the momentum this has generated, so I bump to the 20-30% probability.

The Islamic Republic News Agency barely mentions Soleimani - it lacks the front page fiery anti-U.S. rhetoric that would likely characterize an Iranian state-sanctioned response. Similarly, the Official Website of the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran does not mention Soleimani and the Official website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran makes only one front-page mention of Soleimani (dating from a 11 February 2020 article). Moreover, major U.S. news agencies have not reported any prominent statements emanating from Iran since late January. Further, despite the deployment of a 4,000-member Brigade from the 82nd Airborne, and some minor force protection enhancements in the region, the U.S. has not made public any major deployments of forces in the wake of the strike (e.g., carrier battle groups, Marine Expeditionary Forces, strike aircraft, Tomahawk-capable submarines, etc.). Likewise, open source intelligence has not reported any concerning Iranian troop or strategic asset movements (deployment of ballistic missile batteries to firing points, movement of troops to assembly areas, etc.). As such, it stands to reason that any retaliatory measures by Iran would have been initiated while the event was still fresh in the national memory. Either Iran is still in a \"wait and see\" period of assessing U.S. strategic moves while planning long-range escalatory measures, or Iran has accepted the strike as U.S. signaling that it had crossed a U.S. \"red line,\" and intends to back down any provocative actions for the foreseeable future. This suggests to me that Iran will likely \"lay low\" for a while, until such time it decides to incrementally test the boundaries of U.S. strategic action, which in my opinion, will not be for several more months. Accordingly, at this point I am assessing the probability of a lethal confrontation involving at least one fatality between the military forces of either side in the airspace, seaspace, or landspace of Iran as low and very unlikely. Since there are still roughly 10-11 months remaining on the question, however, I'm leaving a margin open to the possibility.

It is reported that there is documented news on an American decision to close the Albukamal crossing by force.\" https://mobile.twitter.com/Sada_AlSharqieh/status/1217920174109667334"], [81365, "2020-01-16T20:12:26Z", [0.22], "I'm lowering my forecast by 10% after delving deeper into factors that formed my initial base rate and the current situation.  First, my original base rate was roughly 13% based on how few of incidents have occurred in the past 40+ years since the current Iranian government took power in 1979.  I'm not aware of any lethal conflicts between the US and Iran that specifically took place inside Iran or at sea since the mid-80s during the Iran-Iraq war.  Given the roughly 30-year gap in lethal conflicts inside the geographic parameters and the corresponding impact to the scope of the timeline of the question, I assess this makes the base rate lower.  Second, I increased my first forecast from the initial base rate based on the current situation.  However, updates to the current situation warrant lowering the forecast.  Iran accepting responsibility for the shoot down of the Ukrainian airliner decreases the likelihood of Iran conducting higher risk activities at sea or close to its borders in the near term (3-4 months).  Also, US public opinion according to Gallup is against military conflict with Iran.  As the next US election gets closer, I assess that US senior leaders will look to non-military responses (such as economic or diplomatic) before using any lethal military options against Iran.   When reflecting on what factors would cause me to think otherwise and increase the forecast, two potential scenarios come to mind.  First, if Iran increases military activity in other countries where it has proxies, the chances of a lethal conflict will increase.  Suleimani's replacement has not demonstrated whether he will maintain the same level of risk acceptance that Suleimani did.  Second, if economic sanctions decimate Iran's economy, Iran has shown in the past that it will lash out through military means, which will escalate the likelihood of lethal conflict."], [81561, "2020-01-16T17:03:50Z", [0.35], "New developments (iranian people rage against their government) lowed the chance."], [81314, "2020-01-16T04:45:45Z", [0.16], "It is likely that Iran will not retaliate again after an unsuccessful missile attack and plane hit event.

Potentially, this will force a direct confrontation between the U.S. military and Iranian military to some degree.

It might be conducted by proxy or without official confirmation by Iran, but if retaliation will be really big/proportional to Soleimani killing US will retaliate directly into Iran forces. I believe question will be concluded not by Iran retaliation but by another strike by US on Iran forces. \nInteresting thread on how Iran retaliated in the past for killing their people: https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1214712056147922944\nIn January 2012 assassins killed nuclear chemist in Tehran, Israel was widely believed to be behind the killing. Retaliation came month later in Georgia, India and Thailand where Israeli diplomats were targeted with bombs.\nIN 1992 IDF killed Hezbollah secretary general, retaliation that followed came in Buenos Aires where Shiite militant killed 29 civilians in Buenos Aires Israel Embassy. Time horizon of this question is almost one year.  A lot can happen.\nWe have US presidential elections along the way. Will Iranians just wait and hope for change in White House? Maybe if there was strong indications of Trump losing they may wait to have kind of carte blanche with new administration but if race will be close or Trump will likely win I think Iran won\u2019t wait if opportunity arise. \nAlso won't current US president use military action to energize his supporters? Another way it can lead to lethal confrontation is based on important sentence from question itself:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this question, Iran's national military forces include the Revolutionary Guard Corps and Law Enforcement Forces.\u201d\nThere are numerous articles from 2019 where IRGC members were reportedly killed in Syria by Israeli airstrikes. I believe it is highly probable that similar airstrikes targeting militia bases in Syria or Iraq with IRGC presence will be conducted by US air forces. \nIraqi parliament requested US forces to leave Iraq. It is in line with Iran agenda. There are a lot of Iraqi Shiite Militia units associated with Iran mainly PMU which did not revenged their commander killed alongside with Soleimani yet. If US won\u2019t leave and pretty sure that won\u2019t leave Iraq soon. Shiite militias will target US staff in Iraq to revenge and to make stay costly for US in order to rethink staying. It may happen that revenge will be conducted far from now, not in 2020, Maybe Iran will want to wait for 2020 US Elections outcome, but in my opinion lethal confrontation is more probable than not."], [67609, "2020-01-09T15:54:26Z", [0.32], "Now that Iran has retaliated, and having learned a bit about Iran's foreign policy, it is time to update my previous forecast [1]. The inside view is that Iran's decisions will be aimed at continuing their long cold war with Saudi Arabia, while avoiding going as far as to trigger a direct retaliation from the US. This means that it is in the interest of their foreign policy to avoid an attack on the US at sea.  Yet I will not put the probability of this event as low as other forecasters: I will use the partial tit-for-tat model of the previous post, but with four attacks and a probability of 5% that they decide to hit an US vessel or an US plane flying over sea or Iran, followed by a further probability of 50% of victims in that kind of incident. The point is that geopolitical decisions are not necessarily rational. The same applies to the US. Actually the targeting of Soleimani makes much more sense than credited, because it will momentarily reduce the foreign operations of Iran in Iraq and the rest of the middle east. This is consistent with having a proxy war with Iran. But I consider the probability not to be as low as most forecasters are assuming right now. Just past year, after Iran shot an US drone, it was rumored that Trump cancelled an air strike on an Iranian target when it had been already launched. It is difficult to know whether this actually happened, but if it did it means that the chances are larger than acknowledged. Again, I will use the imperfect tit-for-tat model but with two attacks, 20-25% of targeting something within Iran (or an Iranian vessel) and a 50% of causalities if the attack happens. Finally I will also put a 2% probability that the US go nuts and decides to have a large conflict with Iran. Doing the calculations I obtain something in the 30-34% range, which I average to 32%. Notice that with the model I am using it is difficult to get very low probabilities, as the 10%'s many people are obtaining, while it also seems difficult to obtain the almost certainty of the initial forecasts for this question.

In other words, no one regionally is incentivised to enter into a conflict that may very well turn into a prolonged regional conflict and that regional pressure on the US can lead to some interesting compromise (another topic altogether). I do give a minor probability to \"lethal conflict\" because there is always uncertainty, however improbable. Events which would increase the chance of conflict would be significant pivot by Gulf States to sell oil denominated in currencies (or gold) other than the US$. The need for foreigners to buy USTs is become a major \"hidden\" funding issue (unless you subscribe to MMT). Regardless, whilst the US government can self-fund by printing more money, effects on repo and other funding markets might not be able to cope and thus there may be economic incentives for the US to apply pressure to Gulf States to sell oil for dollars. However, there are many ways to get there without the need for conflict and so the probability here is small. Another reason for a small risk is that Iran is not an ideal country to attack. It is mountainous and largely uninhabitable and therefore after the air strikes would take out most of the country's strike capabilities, a ground force would be required to effect regime change and that would likely be a protracted battle against a very large army (much larger than Iraqi) with more sophisticated weaponry with established support from both Russia and China.

Also I am joining a bit late after I took some time to analyze the situation.  ~~~\nDigest: \n~~~ Key paragraph from my analysis - \"The key question then is what the next move from the US would be. Trump just said in his address to the nation that \"Iran is standing down\" - his way of saying he is declaring victory, suggesting that the cycle of military retaliations is over, at least for now.\" This makes me estimate a probability close to the base rate (near zero). Iran may continue to execute actions against the US but those are likely to be much less severe (see my analysis of Iran below) and more targeted toward its long-term goals such as getting the US out of Iraq (see To Watch below).  ~~~\nAnalysis\n~~~ On my mind are the key players: 1) Trump admin, 2) the complex web of Iranian decision makers, and - something I haven't seen mentioned much - 3) allies or potential allies of the US and Iran.  1) The best way I have found to understand Trump's foreign policy is through a Jacksonian lens. This type of foreign policy entails a focus at home (witness \"America-first\") that is unconcerned with trying to accomplish big goals abroad such as spread of democracy or long-term peace. It entails harsh action in defense against imminent danger or to accomplish immediate interests (e.g. Trump's strike against the Soleimani). And it entails avoidance of expending effort overseas, in particular an aversion to engagement in wars. It has been a long-standing public goal of the Trump administration to \"end endless wars\", something his base supports. I wager this goal is a key part of the administration's decision making.  2) Iran has the capability to perform an action that precipitates a \"Yes\" resolution to this question (e.g. a terrorist attack on the US, see \"To Watch\" below). But that is far from its self interest. It seems to me the goals of the regime are self-preservation, getting the US out of Iraq and the broader region, earning the sympathies of other governments, and regaining power through e.g. reduction of sanctions or perhaps getting the bomb one day. The historical base rate of Iranian actions against the US suggest as much - witness the long-term use of proxies and soft targets [1].  Part of this is that Iran cannot appear weak in the face of attacks. Thus, it had to retaliate. We now know what that is - a strike on US-inhabited bases outside of Iran (and perhaps the orchestrated downing of a Boeing plane). Crucially, the supreme leader has said this \"concludes\" the \"proportional\" measures [2]. Interestingly, Iraqi leadership said they knew of the strikes ahead of time (Correction: I read this in WaPo, not NYT [10]). There is a chance Iran tried to make sure nobody gets killed.  The key question then is what the next move from the US would be. Trump just said in his address to the nation that \"Iran is standing down\" - his way of saying he is declaring victory, suggesting that the cycle of military retaliations is over, at least for now. 3) Iran doesn't appear to have allies. Notice that Russia and China's responses to the recent news have been extremely muted. This limits how much they can do. ~~~\nTo watch\n~~~ - Further escalation is more likely if Iran:\n* Helped organize a terrorist attack on Americans\n* Took lethal action against American military\n* Fired on US vessels\n* Gets so close to getting the bomb that it requires an immediate response (not likely in the short term)\n- Further, I would watch how China and Russia respond to the US-Iran tensions. Iran will be emboldened if it finds allies. Noting good point by @Greyowlsova that sometimes nations stumble into wars, or in other words against rational intentions.

Iran's fleet moving out and attacking US's fleet or other military objectives. While recent history shows us that US has attacked directly countries within ME, the conditions were different than what we have today with Iran, which are miles away from the Irak situation, Afganistan or the Sirian conflict. I do agree Trump's (by far) not the brightest mind of the US politicians, but even though he is, still, ruling, he's not a dictator and he is not acting alone. Disregarding his personal thoughts, tweets and desires, which might be to raze Iran with nuclear strikes, I strongly hope that the decisions US are taking are highly influenced by advisers and the interests of more than Trump alone. That being said, who could benefit from US attacking or invading Iran directly (1,2,3)? Would that help his political agenda and would it cause him to be reelected? Without a direct provocation of Iran, I don't see anybody winning, besides weapon manufacturers, by going thorough with such an invasion. Oil supplies will continue to flow from the ME to the rest of the world without Iran being attacked. Also, there's already a lot of influence by US and it's allies in the region. How much of it can Russia and it's allies afford to lose without actually being in a clear economic danger? Close to 0. Iran's being sustained by allies too, most importantly Russia. In any scenario I can think of, Russia would be forced to interfere if US strikes Iran, without being military provoked directly. If they don't interfere, they lose the trust of the rest of the (few) allies they still have. The only scenario where Russia would take their hands of Iran would be one where Iran makes a really bad move, such as scenario (4), where it would see attacking US military directly as a good idea, openly admitting it and actually doing it, against any advice from any reasonable-minded ally. Of course, the situation will escalate, Japan has already announced it is sending 2 war ships to the region to ensure oil supplies are not interrupted, declarations will be made by leaders of each side of the conflict and so on.  There's a very high probability we will see terror attacks around the world, financially supported by Iran, we will also see casualties of US and it's allies in war zones around Iran, like Irak or Afganistan etc.  An opened conflict with Iran is too dangerous now, there are too many things that can go wrong. Asymmetrical warfare is more likely to continue, but that's not included in the question asked here. Drone or missile strikes to nuclear enrichment facilities will be due to have the least possible number of casualties, as close to 0 as possible.

(In the event of an air strike like that I could see a situation where the Iranians might claim that only civilians were killed but the US would claim that mainly military personnel were killed, so I'm not sure how that would resolve.) Another way this question could resolve as 'Yes' would be if Iran were to successfully strike a US ship in the Gulf of Oman or the Persian Gulf. There are plenty of reports of the US having Navy ships in that area but does Iran have the military capability to get through their defences? Iran's unmanned drones like the Qods Mohajer, Shahed 129 and Kaman 12 can fly long distances then drop bombs but are slow (under 200mph), in other words they were designed to attack Israel.\nIranian missiles however are a different matter. Iran has the Kowsar anti-ship missile for example which flies at mach 0.8, is precision guided and has a semi-armour piercing warhead. I'd guess the US would have the technology to defend against something like that but;\na) only one has to get through and kill a US sailor for the question to resolve as 'Yes', and\nb) even if the attack failed it could trigger the US to retaliate causing military fatalities on Iranian soil. Iran can't win a full out war with the US and they have seen in the past that the US has been prepared to invade countries in the Middle East, so unless they have a suicide wish they won't want to get into an out-and-out war or provoke the US into a land war or invasion. One option for the Iranian leadership is to do nothing. The death of Soleimani seems to have generated a lot of domestic political capital which they could simply bank. On the other hand they might feel they need to do something in retaliation.

Once this happens, there will be a 90 chance of Trump launching a counter-attack.  The only question is where.   Of course, the US has no presence in Iran.  Therefore, Iran cannot attack the US in Iran.  It can attack the US in the Gulf with small boats.  However, this would be very dangerous for the Iranian soldiers on the boats; they would likely consider any such attack a suicide mission and not very effective.  Thus, it is possible but unlikely (10 %).  Iran's American jets  that it kept after the revolution seem to have disappeared--probably due to lack of spare parts and overuse during the Iran-Iraq war.  (5%)   Iran did obtain some military jets from Iraq during the Gulf War.  However, all of these jets are old and would likely be easy targets for a modern US aircraft carrier or small ship. (5%)  Also,  Iran's UAV's probably could not reach an American ship.  Thus, there is a less than 10% chance of Iran attacking the US Navy in the Gulf.  The question does limit the confrontation to military forces, which presumably does not include civilian targets such as oil tankers.  The US has attacked Iranian assets in Iraq,  which it could easily do again.  However, if there is a very violent Iranian attack on the US anywhere, the US could and probably would attack Iran on their own soil with either cruise missiles or bombers.  A military facility would be the most likely target because Trump's advisers probably do not want the negative publicity a civilian target would bring.     I suspect cruise missiles are more likely because we have used them to attack land targets in Iraq and Syrian several times in the last few years.  This is the mostly likely method for this question to be answered in the affirmative.    So 90* 70  (us attacking Iran Military base) + 90 * (20 US attacking Iran at sea) + 95 * 0 (attacking US military in Iran) + 95 * (2 Iran attacking and killing American at sea).

However, his words carry little value, since he is rarely consistent. The Iranian regime will have to weigh their options in terms of their own security. On the one hand they will want to make clear that assassinating them will be costly for the US. On the other hand, they will want to avoid any action that creates irresistible pressure on the US to attack.  They will want to calibrate their attack to divide US opinion on how to respond.

US forces attacking Iran's fleet near Iran.\n4. Iran's fleet moving out and attacking US's fleet or other military objectives. While recent history shows us that US has attacked directly countries within ME, the conditions were different than what we have today with Iran, which are miles away from the Irak situation, Afganistan or the Sirian conflict. I do agree Trump's (by far) not the brightest mind of the US politicians, but even though he is, still, ruling, he's not a dictator and he is not acting alone. Disregarding his personal thoughts, tweets and desires, which might be to raze Iran with nuclear strikes, I strongly hope that the decisions US are taking are highly influenced by advisers and the interests of more than Trump alone. That being said, who could benefit from US attacking or invading Iran directly (1,2,3)? Would that help his political agenda and would it cause him to be reelected? Without a direct provocation of Iran, I don't see anybody winning, besides weapon manufacturers, by going thorough with such an invasion. Oil supplies will continue to flow from the ME to the rest of the world without Iran being attacked. Also, there's already a lot of influence by US and it's allies in the region. How much of it can Russia and it's allies afford to lose without actually being in a clear economic danger? Close to 0. Iran's being sustained by allies too, most importantly Russia. In any scenario I can think of, Russia would be forced to interfere if US strikes Iran, without being military provoked directly. If they don't interfere, they lose the trust of the rest of the (few) allies they still have. The only scenario where Russia would take their hands of Iran would be one where Iran makes a really bad move, such as scenario (4), where it would see attacking US military directly as a good idea, openly admitting it and actually doing it, against any advice from any reasonable-minded ally. Of course, the situation will escalate, Japan has already announced it is sending 2 war ships to the region to ensure oil supplies are not interrupted, declarations will be made by leaders of each side of the conflict and so on.  There's a very high probability we will see terror attacks around the world, financially supported by Iran, we will also see casualties of US and it's allies in war zones around Iran, like Irak or Afganistan etc.  An opened conflict with Iran is too dangerous now, there are too many things that can go wrong. Asymmetrical warfare is more likely to continue, but that's not included in the question asked here. Drone or missile strikes to nuclear enrichment facilities will be due to have the least possible number of casualties, as close to 0 as possible.

First a caveat: the reason of using really simple models for estimating the probability is because it is the best way of doing a post-mortem if your prediction fails. In contrast, if one has used standard subjective judgement and hand-waving of probabilities, the post-mortem will be much more subtle and difficult. Let's begin with two braindead outside/inside view combos: 0.a) Outside view: two options, we continue with proxy conflicts or we escalate to direct conflict. Assign 1/2 probability to each and 50% of a positive resolution for this answer. For the inside view: proxy is still much more convenient than direct. The probability of continuing with proxy is therefore higher than direct, for instance twice as high.  In this case we end up with 2/3 proxy and 1/3 direct and a 33% of a positive resolution. 0.b) Outside view: three options, proxy, direct, deescalation, with 1/3 each and a 33% of a positive resolution. For the inside view, deescalation looks unlikely. We reduce it from 1/3 to 1/10. Proxy still twice as likely as direct. We end up with 60% proxy, 30% direct and 10% deescalation and 30% of a positive resolution. Notice that braindead models 0.a and 0.b support the estimations of a few good forecasters. For a good example:  https://www.gjopen.com/comments/comments/939921 0.c) Outside view: in the last twenty years we have had two large invasions of countries, Afghanistan and Iraq. Then we have a base rate of 10% for a similar thing happening in Iran. Inside view: Iran's geography makes a large-scale military action, that would almost certainly lead to a yes resolution, more unlikely. I will divide this number by half, to 5%. Now with outside view 0.c the previous probabilities in 0.a and 0.b have to be slightly modified, becoming 0.05 + 0.95 * p_previous, with p_previous the old one. We end up with 34-36%. Finally, the braindead model: 1.a) Number of attacks by each side: we are going to do a mixture of imperfect tit-for-tat with gratuitous attacks. Based on my previous post [1], which is based on a very handy timeline by Al-Jazeera [2], there seems to be an unprovoked Iranian attack every three months or so. This gives a total of 4 attacks for 2020. The second thing is that the US does not necessarily do tit-for-tat, but instead seems to be more restrained. I used a 50% probability of retaliation for taking into account the current insider view, but a 30% seems to be more realistic. With the 50% we have two retaliatory actions for the 4 expected random attacks. Third, I assume Iran will retaliate for the killing of Suleimani and will further retaliate back if the US retaliates. This adds 2 Iranian attacks and 1 US attack to the current count We end up with 6 Iranian attacks and 3 American attacks, though the numbers can move a lot. 1.b) Probability of a death at sea or at Iranian soul per attack: for this I assign a probability of hitting a target containing personnel of the other's side military within the frontiers (p) specified in the question followed by the probability of such personnel dying (s). For Iran: p = 10% (they must hit a vessel for that), s = 50%\nFor the US: p = 50% (well, too high too, but they have the capabilities), s = 50% Now with that I compute the probability of no-one dying, which is the easiest thing to compute. This is given by these simple Mathematica code:  Pnc[n_, p_, s_] := \n Sum[Binomial[n, r] (1 - p)^(n - r) p^r (1 - s)^r, {r, 0, n}] which refers to the probability of non-causalities. With the 6 Iranian and 3 US attacks, they are: 72 and 42%. Combining them: 31% of no-causalities, 69% of causalities. 1.c) For the final touch, I include 0.c in the equation, ending up with (0.05 + 0.95*0.69) = 0.71, which is my current estimation. 1.d) In the future the model can be improved by considering a probability distribution for the number of Iranian and American attacks, which can be combined with the probabilities obtained in 1.b to get a better estimate. However, I feel that this is overkill for the moment. 1.e) By using this model and playing with the input probabilities we can get a feel of how the factors interplay with each other. With more realistic estimates, for instance 30% of retaliation and maybe a 40% of direct attack to Iran by the US, we will end up with a 45% of yes or even lower. The estimation of these probabilities will be clearer in a few days, I would expect.

The first problem is the input data, for which I will use the timeline in [1]. Now, we go to the rocket strikes and other similar antics. From this and a simple causal model I will calculate an outside view probability. First, I will assume that the current situation is an imperfect tit-for-tat game, with a few unprovoked attacks (mostly from Iran): 1) We begin the game with the Drone incident (Iran), with received not answer from the US but it was close.\n2) We continue with the attack on the Saudi oil refinery (Iran), with did not have an answer.\n3) We have the Kirkuk base incident (Iran), which...\n4) ... has an answer (US, the Kataib Hizbulla strike) two days later, which...\n5) ... was followed by the besieging of the US embassy for a day two days later, which...\n6) ... was followed by the attack on Soleimani, three days later. This is not much, but allows to play a bit with the numbers. We obtain the following: a) There is a random attack every three months or so by Iran on something which might have american military presence, but probably will not have.\nb) The probability of the US answering is somewhere between 1/3 (if we exclude the embassy besieging) or 1/2 (if we include it)\nc) The US might attack without provocation depending on the interpretation of the killing of Suleimani\nd) I will assume that Iran always answers to a previous attack This gives a base rate of 4 attacks from Iran in 2020, to which we add 1 for retaliation, followed by a 0.5 chance of an US answer, etc. This will give an average of 6 Irani attacks and 3 US attacks if we assume that Iran is a perfectly retaliatory tit-for-tat player and the US a coin-flip retaliatory player. In short, 6 Irani attacks, 3 US attacks. Now, this goes with the probability of personnel from the opposing military dying in any of these attacks. I will give a 10% per attack for Iran and 50% for the US. Then I combine this with an extra 50% probability of an actual death in each of these attacks. Without doing the calculations correctly, which requires binomial coefficients and other things that I don't feel like calculating right now, this gives me like a 47% probability of no one dying and a 53% probability of at least one person dying. A detailed calculation will probably increase the probability above the 53% I have just given now, but I leave that for tomorrow.

In this case, that perception works to his advantage. I have absolutely no idea how Trump would react to any Iranian retaliation for the Soleimani killing. I don't think anyone else here or elsewhere has any idea either, and that certainly includes the leadership in Tehran. One assumption that I would say is safe to make, however, is that Trump doesn't care about \"proportional\" responses, and he is completely indifferent to domestic or international criticism, which has been relentless since he entered political life.  If I am correct, the risk presented to the Iranian regime may be unacceptably high. While they can't let the killing of Soleimani go unanswered, they can't take the chance that Trump would be willing to undertake the kind of retaliation that would prompt a popular uprising against the regime. I should add that I doubt if Trump would launch such a strike except as a riposte to an Iranian move, but if Iran retaliates against U.S. naval assets, for example, I think anything can happen. Similarly, if Iran is responsible for the loss of American lives (especially civilian lives), Trump may launch a retaliatory strike with the objective of a destabilizing the Iranian regime. I don't think that there will be a popular rallying in support of the regime in the event of U.S. strikes against the IRGC or the Iranian oil industry, or the regime in general. There tends to reach a point in a protracted struggle that the rank-and-file on one side simply decides that the sacrifices have been too great, and that capitulation is preferable to continued strife.

Iran could greenlight Shiite militia groups to significantly escalate rocket and roadside bomb attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq, and to organize additional protests and assaults against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Iranian proxies may target the few hundred American forces protecting oil fields in eastern Syria or direct attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Iran could fire ballistic missiles at U.S. facilities in Iraq or the Persian Gulf, ramp up the sabotage of international shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, launch additional missile or drone attacks against critical energy infrastructure in the region, or encourage Lebanese Hezbollah or Palestinian militants to attack Israel. Tehran could orchestrate terrorist attacks against Americans or U.S. interests in the region, as it did in the 1980s in Beirut and in 1996 at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, or plot an attack inside the United States, as it attempted to do in 2011 against the Saudi ambassador in Washington.

Iran needs to hit us but I think the odds of them doing it directly are low, like 30%? vs 70% they do it through a proxy. They want to accomplish three things: 1) they need to send the message to their people that they responded forcefully; 2) they want sanctions lifted; 3) they want to gain political advantage in the mideast as the leader of the Shiites. It seems like the best solution to those three is an attack through proxies that hits our allies, or perhaps Americans. However a direct attack would be certain to have the sanctions increased and would incur more wrath from Trump who has demonstrated that he ready and willing to out-crazy anyone. Then we get to respond. At that point I think more strategic heads will prevail. Then Trump de-escalates, declares victory and moves on to the next topic.  NOTE: Given the way the GJOpen Brier score calculations work, this question is asymmetrical: if there is a conflict it will resolve early (resulting in a lower impact on one's average); vs if there is no conflict then it will resolve 1/1/2021 (with a bigger impact).

[1] I think it still provides a useful outside view for this question, but I think the inside view is probably more relevant right now. Right now there are two main actors, Trump and Iran's leadership. Trump seems prone to conflict in the region - he seems to think it'll improve his elections odds given his proclivity for saying Obama would start wars to win elections - and if he wishes could easily start targeting Iran forces within Iran. In addition, Republican leadership seems to support this action which may increase his probability of going forward [2]. Even if they are skeptical behind closed doors, they have no way of limiting his power without coming out and opposing him publicly. Trump may also be gauging how the public responds to this tactic. If it sufficiently positive, he may be incentivized to go further. Similarly, Iranian leadership wants to retaliate and they've shown they're willing to take action in recent months.

Iran\u2019s  objective is not to goad the US into a costly conventional war they know they are unlikely to win, but rather lure the US into an unconventional proxy conflict in Iraq or elsewhere in which they do stand a realistic chance of winning or at least obtaining a favorable settlement. Their interests are much better served (and at much lower cost) by standing back while their proxies and clients do all the dirty work of bloodying US forces with the help of Iranian arms and advisors, ultimately drawing the US into a long-term, un-winnable stalemate and war of attrition, and waiting for the US to inevitably defeat itself through growing public divisions and yawning government \u201ccredibility gaps\u201d (no doubt supplemented with a healthy dose of Russia-aided social-media psy-ops and propaganda warfare campaign). This is exactly what the Iranian military has been preparing for over the past 10-15 years. Assuring this outcome also gives incentive to higher-ups in the Iranian government to demand that ground-level officers and bureaucrats exercise additional restraint and tighten up their procedures to circumvent the possibility of an untimely direct confrontation between conventional forces at the present stage that could escalate into an undesirable scenario.  In the wake of yesterday\u2019s air strike, the Iranians must certainly have taken note of headlines like this one the New York Times: \u201cU.S. Strike on Iranian General Divides Congress\u201d that indicate little public support at the moment for a war against Iran and unease over Trump\u2019s actions. Thus, they are unlikely to respond with a spectacular show of force\u2014say, sinking an aircraft carrier resulting in thousands of US casualties or shutting off the Straits of Hormuz and causing widespread economic upheaval. Such actions would not only risk fomenting a \u201crally around the flag\u201d effect in the US, but Iran also knows that these domestic divisions constrain the extent the US government can respond. Keeping the US public divided is all-around in their best interests. Additionally, notice how in the wake of yesterday\u2019s assassination, Khamenei took to Twitter to express revenge, rather than an address to the nation\u2014 as would be expected if we were on the precipice of a grave crisis. Twitter messages should be seen as more for external consumption. This fact alone should speak volumes to analysts. Another thing to keep in mind is that wars don\u2019t just materialize out of thin air. They require months of preparation and planning which produce indicators that can\u2019t be hidden from prying eyes. Things like: mobilization orders, reserve call-ups, cancelling leave, intensified military exercises and training, transportation and communication restrictions in key staging areas, shortages and rationing of food and fuel, unusual large-scale orders for things like body bags and medical supplies, intensified internal propaganda and patriotic messaging to prepare the populace, conducting civil defense drills, etc. Thus far, we have seen none of these things in Iran. Nor have we seen any meaningful movement of US assets to the region. Thus far, there is nothing to indicate either side is gearing up for or expecting a major conflict in the near term. What will likely happen is that the Soleimani story will fade from the headlines\u2014just as the Iranian drone shoot-down and Saudi oil facility attack did. Instead, Iran will respond to this quietly by activating and arming their various militia networks, like the Mehdi Army, in Iraq and possibly other places like Syria or Yemen to continue carrying out small-scale attacks on US interests in the Middle East with the objective of enticing the US into Vietnam II. Also, from the US perspective, keeping the Iranian situation at a simmer without boiling over is also very much in the interests of the US and the rest of the Middle East because it has been providing an impetus for a nascent rapprochement between Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States, which could ultimately lead to accomplishing an overriding long-term US objective in the region: Arab-Israeli peace. All-out conflict would remove this incentive at this stage, though Iran might also try to draw Israel into any proxy conflict with the hope of dividing this burgeoning Israel-Sunni anti-Iran alliance by inflaming the \u201cArab Street.\u201d"], [745, "2020-01-04T01:35:06Z", [0.97], "Suleimani"], [34516, "2020-01-04T00:40:52Z", [0.3], ""], [43311, "2020-01-04T00:02:54Z", [1.0], "5 more people dead.

The administration has said countless times they want to withdraw but that it must be on their terms and time table - any attempt to hasten via violence would be met with retaliation.
