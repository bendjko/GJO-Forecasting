For me, participating in this question is a good example of the difference between the Brier-Median score and the Accuracy score. I got a relatively decent \"net Brier\" (Brier - Median), but a relatively low Accuracy score compared to the crowd. My Accuracy owes to my relatively low participation rate (15%).  Generally, I try to have a high participation rating. It's a greater challenge and it avoids \"sniping\" questions (there is some incentive for that for the purpose of gaining on forecasters who have participated for a long time but neglected to update toward the end of the question period), as discussed with @Ken_Barns earlier.  However, this question demonstrates that there can be value (in terms of contributing to the crowd's accuracy) in providing forecasts later in a question's period. In my particular case, I was already participating in the other Supreme Court question so it made sense to join this one as well. But I did not feel I could add much value to the crowd (to some extent due to lack of time) so I avoided it. Yet, after the allegations came out, I saw that I might have an edge on the crowd, which was giving a high chance of >2, which seemed unwarranted given the possibility of an ensuing partisan fight over a large Dem issue (#metoo). The crowd also shifted rather abruptly toward '0', which I was also questioning. So I decided to join the question at that point (although rather late), and indeed, my forecast added value as evidenced by my Brier/Median scores*.

So based on what I understand. I think all Dems would vote against it as the highest probability for both political and or moral reasons. But as someone stated below, a yes vote would allow them to change their minds within 48 hours. So they might vote tactically to later delay the vote to allow for further time for any damning evidence that might come up? Right or wrong, you can see how the longer the decision is put off the less 'sealed the deal is.' It wouldn't take more than one person to vote yes and change their mind, and, if this was a tactic they were using - that would be all the majority they would allow.

Once it is apparent that the Republicans will win the vote regardless of Dems, which is likely unless Murkowski (Alaska) and/or Collins (Maine) make a public decision soon, it is easier for the Dems to break the party line and not be the deciding vote for the confirmation, thereby lessening blowback.\nIn conclusion, I expect 2 Dems to vote in favor, likely Manchin and Donnelly, but each senator seems to be 'reviewing the record' until the eleventh hour, likely to gain more leverage for other goals of theirs in other votes. Alternatively, a strictly party-line vote also seems plausible.
