Now, I know the route from Eritreia to Europe is quite dangerous, as seen in several news articles, apart from the one above, that states 3k eritreans drowning in one year, so I would assume 3k over 5k * 12 months mortality = 5% Then I will assume very few of them give up mid-journey, about another 5% of them. So in this approach, 15k * (1 - 5% - 5%) = 13.5k 2. It seems one of the preferred regions of eritreans is Italy (from the WSJ article), which received over 35k eritrean migrants in 2015 (https://www.iom.int/news/mediterranean-update-migrant-deaths-rise-3329-2015), roughly 9k a quarter. But this is just Italy, so this number should be higher than 9k for the entire Europe.

According to Eritrean refugees, those caught to sneak out are thrown into inhuman prison facilities where they will be tortured and ultimately accused of treason, a charge punishable by death. \"Most of them prefer to cross the Mediterranean Sea mainly heading to Italy for better life however thousands has drowned and lost their lives in the Mediterranean. Bereket Yisak, who returned back to Ethiopia after he fail to succeed reaching Israel told Sudan Tribune that many Eritreans who fall in the hands unscrupulous human traffickers are taken hostage and their family back at home are asked to pay ransom of an average $15,000 per head for their release.  If their relatives fail to pay, he said, Eritrean hostages will be tortured to death or else parts of their organs such as Kidneys will be harvested and are sold to people in need of it in wealthier nations. \"According to Bereket, a lot of Eritrean refugees are abducted in Sudan and taken to Sinai where captors decide on the fate of the hostage. He adviced Eritreans to refrain from using smuggling trail.\n. . . \n\"Since 2014, the number of Eritreans seeking asylum in Europe particularly in Italy has soared making them the second largest group - after Syrians - to arrive in the European nation by boat; according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). \"Refugees in Addis Ababa say they are better off in Ethiopia under the out of camp policy and they say the scheme has restrained tendency of considerable number Eritrean refugees from taking peril journeys to Sudan, Libya or further to Europe. \"The refugees added they have benefited a lot from the governments \u201cout of camp policy\u201d\nAccording to the refugees, the scheme has helped them find jobs in the informal sector.\n\u201cWe are being treated here very well here. I am currently working in different places as an electrician. I earn good money\u201d, said 27-year old Gideon Samuel. \u201cAt the camps we had nothing to do but the out of camp policy has given us freedom of movement enabling us to work and support ourselves and not to be dependent on the government or Aid agencies\u201d, added Gideon. He further said, living in cities has enabled refugees to improve their access to a lot of services which are not available at camps.\n. . . \nPreviously the UN refugee agency has resettled thousands of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia to different western countries under its third country resettlement program. Despite the limited quota, third country resettlement program to Eritrean refugees remains effective both in terms meeting the needs of vulnerable groups and as a durable solution to a limited number of refugees.\n. . . \nUNHCR says there is a plan to increase resettlement opportunities for refugees in Ethiopia in the coming years, including for Eritrean refugees.

Since this is a prediction for q1 2016 and q1 2015 was considerably lower than all other quarters I am led to believe that it is going to follow a similar pattern and be lower.

If the trend from the 1st 8 months of 2015 holds true you would have 6,258 applications.  Because the acceptance rate is 90% I'll multiple 6,258 by .9 (assuming a full reapplication rate from the 10% that are denied - this is an in exact #). The result is 5,632 applications. With 5,632 applications as the baseline, I offer the below adjustments: (+)The last 5 months (May-Sept 2015) showed a marked increase over the first three months, averaging close to 4,000 a month. (+)On Jan 26th the Eritrean government announced a 'two wives policy' calling for men to marry two women or be forced to jail for life (replenishing population due to Civil War w/ Ethopia. Based on recent upward trend and recent government decisions that will likely contribute to growing numbers of asylum seekers, I find it reasonably likely that asylum seekers will surpass 10,000. Keep in mind, total population is likely less than 6M (6.333 as of 2013) so there is a fairly low ceiling.

I'm going to try and keep things simple, sticking to base rate and assuming that last year's seasonal patterns will be similar to this year's. Both of these data sources point to a low number of applications, while the 15,000+ predictions I've seen tend to hinge on more complicated explanations about \"bottlenecks\" and application strategies. These complicated explanations may well pan out, but I'll stick with simplicity for now and watch the crowd's view carefully.  Also, I'm placing a bit less probability on 10-15 than might be expected, given that I allow the possibility of 15,000+. If the number is higher than 10,000, that could easily be because something threw the conservative model way off -- in which case, I'd like to be prepared for an extreme outcome. Given that between 10,000 and 20,000 people ask for asylum, I'd give roughly 25% odds that the number is between 15,000 and 20,000. Other thoughts: * Compared to asylum-seekers from most other nations, Eritreans are almost all between the ages of 18 and 34. This implies that single people are moving to find employment (and perhaps send remittances), since few children are applying. Employment could imply seasonal migration (e.g. for farming), which might account for the steadiness we see in how rates fluctuate by quarter. This is a complex explanation, and I don't put much weight on it, but it's in the back of my mind. (Another explanation for the age range -- that refugees are fleeing conscription into national service -- isn't necessarily seasonal, which is one strike against this view.) * Developments in the \"ongoing authoritarian crisis\" in Eritrea don't seem likely to cause massive shifts in migration. The things that often worry human rights organizations (dissidents thrown in prison, crackdowns on the media) may not be all that impactful for the population at large. War in Syria affects all Syrians; political tyranny in Eritrea seems like it would affect a much smaller portion of Eritreans (especially given that the situation in Eritrea isn't especially  new or unpredictable)."], [1450, "2016-01-19T03:51:05Z", [0.73, 0.21, 0.06], ""], [15919, "2016-01-19T03:11:30Z", [0.6, 0.3, 0.1], ""], [15425, "2016-01-19T02:30:17Z", [0.92, 0.08, 0.0], "Agree with logic of Paddyboy11\nSeasonal pattern looks even weaker in first q 2016 (had originally estimated for last Q 2015)"], [102, "2016-01-19T01:48:25Z", [0.77, 0.21, 0.02], ""], [15425, "2016-01-19T01:17:13Z", [0.75, 0.23, 0.02], "15,000 only reached once in the last 5 quarters\nSeems to be a seasonal pattern to refugee moves - weather related?\nAs a result thinking there will be less refugees in Q4 than Q3 - maybe around 9000"], [12302, "2016-01-19T01:12:59Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [13980, "2016-01-18T22:45:42Z", [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], ""], [73, "2016-01-18T22:00:07Z", [0.82, 0.18, 0.0], ""], [3702, "2016-01-18T21:58:50Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], ""], [3702, "2016-01-18T21:58:40Z", [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "According to the UNHCR, the typical path for Eritrean asylum seekers is through Libya, across the Mediterranean to Italy by boat and then by hook or by crook to a rich nation: UK, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway for asylum.  I plotted the monthly Italian arrival data from 2014 against the monthly asylum seeker data. I'm not sure the data is 100% accurate in the most recent months. I found a compelling graphical correlation (and a 91% correlation coefficient!) by first taking a 3-month rolling average and using that as my inputs.  Then lagging the arrival data by 1 month, so I'm comparing last month's arrivals to this month's asylum seekers. So I think it makes sense to ignore any airplane, land travelers, and Greeks and focus on the December, January, and February arrivals.  My linear regression indicates that the 1st quarter total will be 3,000 plus 69% of those Italian arrivals. In the first 17 days of January there are 280 Eritreans arrived in Italy, I'll gross this up to 500.  I can't find the December data, but in November there were 86 arrivals. In December of the prior year there were 317 in November and 140 in December.  I will put this at 200.  In February it was 646 and 253 the last two years, I'll put it at 500.  This gets me to a 1200 arrival lagged estimate and a regression estimate of 3800 arrivals. One way to check the model is to predict the asylum seekers in Q4 2015. Someone has posted on here that they found it, but I couldnt verify it.  the model predicts 7900 asylum seekers in the 4th quarter. @PStauble claims there are 6700 asylum seekers in Q4 2015.   @morrell more recently claims there are 8200 asylum seekers in Q4 2015.  Both cite Eurostat data I havent yet verified.  This is close enough for me, strong validation of the model.  Seems very difficult for this to creep above 10,000 based on the slowdown in Italy arrivals. UPDATE: The December number has been posted, much higher than expected at 1,280 Eritreans.  I had predicted 200, but I think this overage in large part is due to 1,000 of them arriving in Sicily on Christmas.  No sign of this being a repeated event subsequently.

Founded in April 1993, after a bloody and costly war of independence with Ethiopia, the State of Eritrea has been ruled with an iron fist by Isaias Afwerki, former leader of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. Eritrea regularly ranks at the bottom of pretty much every global ranking, from religious freedom to human rights, including a noteworthy bottom position for the world press freedom rankings (below North Korea). The country is renowned for its lifelong conscription, where young men are forced to serve the government indefinitely with a pay of under 2 USD per day. Defectors, resisters and political opponents are regularly imprisoned and add to the ranks of the estimated 10,000 political prisoners serving sentences at the pleasure of the state and its extensive secret police force. Systemic violence, fear, sexual abuse, corruption, torture and murder are a regular part of everyday life in modern Eritrea.\n\tThe ever deteriorating situation in Eritrea has unsurprisingly caused a significant number of its citizens to flee in search of better lives and an escape from persecution. In 2015 alone over 30,000 Eritrean asylum seekers arrived in the EU for the first time. As of June 2015, the UNHCR estimates that there are over 440,000 asylum seekers and refugees worldwide originating from Eritrea - a country with a population of around 6 million people. In Q1 of 2015, there were 3155 applications for asylum from Eritrean citizens for the first time in the EU. Plotting the data shows that Q1 is historically a numerical low point for Eritrean refugees arriving in Europe. Q1 2014 had 2,940 arriving and Q12015 had a slightly higher number at 3,155. Unsurprisingly the numbers have grown significantly since the 2012 Arab Spring threw Libya and Egypt, the two main countries between Eritrea and Europe, into varying degrees of chaos. \n\tMy initial prediction is that the Q1 2016 numbers will be similar to those of the previous two years - around 3,000 persons. To try and estimate how this number may be wrong, I decided to look at three things: the starting country, the journey and the destination. My goal was to determine if any of these factors would cause an increase from the 3,000 outside value I predicted.\n\tLooking at the current situation in Eritrea shows that, although it does not seem to be a great place to live, it is not getting much worse. Many theories even point towards it getting better. Eritrea has achieved several development goals put forward by the UN and has in the last years had significant success in reducing the spread of HIV. The government is currently in talks with neighbouring countries to \u201cbring it out of the cold\u201d, and a number of European nations have reacted to the large number of refugees by suggesting that sanctions against Eritrea should be lessened so that the country can be allowed to develop economically. There are even persisting rumours that the national service will soon be decreased or changed. Although things are not getting better, they don\u2019t seem to be getting much worse at the moment. \nOn the other hand, there are prevalent theories that the government is encouraging people to leave - or at the very least not discouraging them. Around 20 to 30% of Eritrea's GDP comes from Eritreans living abroad, either in the form of remittance payments or in the form of taxes which the Eritrean government levies on its citizens no matter where they live. It is not inconceivable that the government could be encouraging a diaspora in an attempt to boost the economy. Despite this possibility, I think that if this was the planned tactic of the government it would be more obvious, and would already have been either publicly condemned or at the very least already have had an impact on the number of refugees and be reflected in the statistical analysis. Generally, looking at Eritrea I get the overall impression that the country is completely stagnant. This leads me to believe that there will probably not be any significant changes occurring this quarter that will cause the people to flee Eritrea even more than they have in the last two years.\nThe second aspect to look at is the route to Europe. In the last few years the path to Europe has become ever easier for Eritrean refugees. Previously the Libyan border to the North was relatively well defended and acted as somewhat of a barrier for Eritreans moving up to northern Africa and the Mediterranean. Additionally, many other countries have started expelling Eritrean refugees. Notable examples include Israel, which has gotten stricter with the treatment of African refugees in recent years - most infamously by building a wall along the Egyptian border in 2012 and expelling large numbers of refugees in recent months. This tightening of the Israeli borders has forced refugee flows to move further north towards the Mediterranean where they can try their luck in Europe.\nAnother relevant factor for the journey is the relatively mild winter that Europe has enjoyed so far. In 2014 and 2015 the minimum weekly temperature in Malta averaged between 8 and 12 degrees in January and February, and was slightly higher in March. In January alone the average weekly minimum has already been closer to 14 degrees. Nicer weather obviously makes the trip significantly less risky and uncomfortable and increases the chances that the number of refugees attempting to come to Europe by sea will increase. Of course, a number of other refugees will attempt the route overland by plane, car, train or other methods and through other routes. However, I do not believe that the number of persons taking these types of routes will be significantly affected by the weather.\nOn the other hand, although the weather may make a crossing easier, the European Union has significantly increased its fight against smugglers in recent months. The ongoing media and political focus on people smugglers transporting the ever increasing number of refugees to Europe has lead to massively increased interest and investment in policing the seas and attempting to stop smugglers from even bringing people across to Europe. I think that compared to Q1 2014 and Q1 2015 these missions will already have a significant impact on making the journey from Africa to Europe even more difficult. However, the fact that smugglers and travel routes have in the meantime already become well established and well practiced may serve to mitigate the impact that increased police and military focus on the issue has.\nFinally, I think the destination of Europe is becoming increasingly unattractive and inhospitable for refugees. I believe that the goodwill that the EU has shown, championed mainly by Angela Merkel, will not be permanent and that isolated events like the New Year attacks in K\u00f6ln will lead to increased antipathy against refugees and immigrants. Politicians hoping to win easy points with the public are already capitalising on the fear of foreigners and policies regarding refugees are already starting to become stricter. I think this means that the EU will work to increase funding for border protection, will make the process for registering as an asylum seeker or refugee even more difficult and will start to do more and more to deter refugees from coming to Europe. However, this reaction most likely will not have a huge effect in Q1 of 2016, but will probably be felt by refugees coming later in the year. And despite this, living in the EU is most likely still better than living stateless in an Ethiopian refugee camp or serving for life in the Eritrean military. Eritrean refugees simply have so little to lose and so much to potentially gain that I think very few changes in policy in the EU would make them not want to come there. Therefore I think that political changes within the EU will have a minimal impact on the number of refugees wanting to or trying to reach the shores of Europe.\nOverall, my analysis so far indicates that the numbers may increase slightly over last year due to the mild weather, but also that this effect may be somewhat mitigated by increased investment in border control in the EU. Of course there are other outliers that may be unexpected, but have a significant impact on the number of refugees. One not completely unlikely scenario is that Eritrea's conflict with Ethiopia starts again. This would not only likely displace a large number of Eritreans, but potentially also lead to the expulsion of the large Eritrean diaspora living in Ethiopia. Many of these refugees would move north towards Europe rather than be caught in the fight. However, the conflict has not erupted into full blown fighting in several years, and I see the chances of it happening in the next 2.5 months as rather unlikely. A second factor could be a change in the level of conflict in Libya. Currently I think that Libya has just the right amount of chaos to facilitate refugees in reaching Europe. Any more conflict and I think it would become very difficult for large groups of refugees to travel through Libya. Any less conflict and the government (if a true government existed) would be forced/supported by the EU to stop the flow. I do not see any significant changes happening in Libya in the next months that would change the status quo there significantly. The same appears to be the case in Egypt. The UNHCR states that continued instability in Egypt, combined with a lack of resources, has made it easy for refugees to travel through the country and up to Europe. The UNHCR predicted that this would be the case all through 2015 (it was) and I don\u2019t see any significant enough changes within Egypt to indicate that this will suddenly change in Q1 2016.\nPutting all this together I think that the lack of change in Eritrea, Egypt and Libya will mean that the numbers will stay around 3,000 persons. It is possible that the mild winter could mean an increase to around 5,000. I also think it is possible to increase if the government of Eritrea actively allows or forces people to leave. However, I do not believe that the number will more than triple from the last two years and reach the 10,000 mark unless there is a truly significant event in Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Libya. Since these countries are quite big, quite unstable, and quite unpredictable, I say there is a 12% chance that some event will occur that will push the number up to between 10 and 15,000 refugees - as was the case in Q2 2014 (11,140) or Q3.2015 (12,220) - when the weather was nicer than it is now. I think there is an 8% chance that the mild weather (or some other completely unexpected event) will completely cause the flow of refugees to overwhelm Europe's borders and lead to numbers closer to those of Q3 2014 (15,145). I do think that the overall numbers of refugees will increase, however I really don\u2019t predict an increase in the number of Eritreans, as their incentives and opportunities just haven\u2019t changed enough to cause such a huge shift.

It would take a huge increase to reach 10k or 15k; such an increase is possible (there was a 679% increase in asylum seekers from 2013 Q2 to 2014 Q2) but would be against the current declining trend."], [12302, "2016-01-12T22:08:07Z", [0.1, 0.6, 0.3], ""], [5001, "2016-01-12T22:01:54Z", [0.45, 0.5, 0.05], "For 2015, Kosovo is #3 and Albania is #5.

Doing a quick and dirty multiplication of this figure by 3, presuming a similar rate of traffic for the whole month we get a potential inflow to Europe of around 54,000 for the month - 10x that of Jan last year. Making the presumption that similar trends continue in Feb, we could see 72,000 cross-Med refugees in that month (7,271 in Feb 2015). and 100,000 in March (10,424 in March 2015). We don't know what proportion of this figure is equated for by Eritreans. Unaware of any major political change that could make the desire for refugees to leave the extremely repressive state of Eritrea - so let us presume the rate remains the same as overall for last year - 4%.  = 4% of (54,000 + 72,000 + 100,000)  = 9,040.  This figure also doesn't account for Eritreans who reach Europe by other routes than crossing the Med.  However, the EU stats at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/f/f1/First_time_asylum_applicants_in_the_EU-28_by_citizenship%2C_Q3_2014_%E2%80%93_Q3_2015.png do show that there was a downturn in applications from Eritrea of-23% between Q3 2014 and Q3 2015 Does the number of uncounted Eritrean refugees who enter the EU not via the Med represent a counterbalance to this 23% decline? Again, not sure. Libya route appears most likely - those arriving by plane directly to Europe from Eritrea,  only likely to be a tiny proportion, not least because Eritrea is one of the very few countries to impose exit visa requirements (stated in https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/459486/Eritrea_-_Illegal_Exit_-_v2_0e.pdf) "], [368, "2016-01-12T21:18:48Z", [0.0, 0.5, 0.5], "Revised estimate : Tightening of the political space within the EU with regard to migration and political refugees has increased in its intensity as its social and political space becomes more conflictual.

The subjective probability estimate for 2016 for Eritrean applicants should be expected to be within the 10,000 or > 15,000 range.   This range will depend on data within the 4thQ yet to be reported. The total number of first time applicants for status as political refugees in the EU was approximately 410,000 in the third quarter of 2015. Eritrean applicants were 3% of that total (12,300).  Estimates indicate that the general trend is that there were significant increases in 2015 over 2014 numbers.   One can expect that the estimates for the first quarter of 2016 will not be significantly curtailed and could fall within the 4th quarter estimated range.
