(I'm old enough to remember the Arch Deluxe!) So today's McDonald's may be warier of a big plant-based burger rollout than its competitors. And though the company is a late entry into the fake meat market, its commitment to the test phase means we're probably less likely to see a quick Dunkin'-style turnaround and a more measured rollout. If the Canada trial does turn out to be a bust, McDonald's plant-based burger timeline might get even slower.

McDonald's said the 12-week (3 months) test would allow it learn more about real-world implications of serving the PLT, including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations [1].

They've had poor results in the past with healthy food items, which may make them more cautious\n-It's a logistics headache for them because stores would have to dedicate grill space to the plant burger; McD is by far the largest fast food chain, so this is more relevant to them than to others and may require more lead time to plan for a release\n-They're doing fine from a sales perspective based on their current marketing and management of their core beef products; they've been actively working to pare down their menu \n-Other chains like Chipotle have declined to offer a plant-based option, citing concerns that they are too processed. Anecdotally, I believe people who care about plant-based food options feel the same way and won't be drawn to McD by a plant-based option, so they may not bring in new consumers by offering one\n-Marketing-wise, I don't see the holiday season as a time to introduce healthy alternatives. A quick Google search also gave me the impression that they do a lot of releases in April. I could see them coming out with a plant burger in the early part of 2020 to capitalize on people's New Year's resolutions to eat better Ultimately, the success of the Impossible Burger seems to suggest that McD will eventually release a plant-based option, probably before the end of 2020, but I am skeptical that it will happen in the latter part of 2019.

Like haven't they sponsored the Olympics? But then I started to doubt myself and just did a quick google for this subject specifically. It pulled up an article less than two months old with some surprising quotes \"McDonald\u2019s Germany recently said it will roll out plant-based options in that country, but top executives in the U.S. have said they are concerned about the effect adding a new menu item will have on the speed of service.

McDonalds IS a big name, they must be the #1 fast food brand that doesn't have to worry about getting \"left behind.\" And yeah they are so huge that ANY change is gonna be a giant risk, involve a LOT of changes to process and pricing to research. They're already all busy making advances in technology to speed up service, like self service kiosks and apps to accommodate food delivery culture. They really don't have much to lose by letting other companies take the hit during the learning curve and wait it out to see if its a passing trend. Burger King has always been a fairly edgy member of the fast food family, they have TACOS for god's sake. They take risks and do wacky stuff with their branding all the time, always exploring food novelties like their chicken nugget fries. So them taking the lead doesn't really say too much about what others are gonna do OH and I just noticed this question came with its own sources to read, this is my first one, and yeah those all pretty much confirm my current thoughts. I actually might reduce my percentage down from 18% where it was when I started typing.

Many fast food operations operate on limited space and labor. Thus, multiple menu offering requires careful planning.\n17.

Customer satisfaction scores are jumping In other words - McDonalds has a lot on its plate, and is showing excellence in ways that are very clearly smart and winning.  The Impossible Burger is three times more expensive - and very difficult and time consuming to make.   This argues against making it.  Of course there are beyond foods, and mcdonalds own offerings in finland and france.  Still, they have been twice tapped over when bringing to the US market.  While I agree that vegan food is growing, is it clear MCD needs it?    It may entirely be my imagination, but I think of a vegan burger the best time to introduce it is in the summer.  You know when there are vegetables. On the other side of the question: all mcdonalds has to do is announce it.  Other than that I would be 0. Crowd ratio is at 80%.

It is about fast food vegetarian burger (McDonald) in the next 5 months.   While vegetarian burgers have been around of many years, the Impossible Meat and Beyond Meat are the two companies that generated most of the buzz recently.  This is especially the case after Beyond Meat's IPO and its stock performance afterwards.  Burger King, McDonald's main competitor, has tested its Impossible Burger in St. Louis early this year.  It has seen a 18% rise in traffic for the stores with Impossible Burger [1].  I suspect that a lot of the increase is due to curiosity.  It will have a nationwide roll out by the end of 2019.    McDonald does not sell vegetarian burgers in the US, although it sells them in Sweden and Germany [2] where 10% of the population are vegetarians.  The burgers it sells in Europe is from Nestle which will sell its vegetarian burgers in grocery stores in the US in the fall this year. There is no need for McDonald to jump into this market in a hurry.  The situation it faces is not like Microsoft missing the Internet revolution.  The market share of fast food vegetarian burgers is small compared with its main meat products.  It is more prudent to see how Burger King does with its nationwide roll out before making a decision.  It can always jump in at a later time without losing its main market share of meat burgers.  That means waiting beyond the end of the year.   However, it is likely that McDonald will announce a test market before the end of the year without a nation wide roll out.  This move allows to test its Nestle-based burgers or go for a different brand (it is not clear to me whether the Nestle vegetarian burgers taste better than Beyond and Impossible burgers, which generated most of the buzz) and placates its critics (for not offering vegetarian burgers).

Share of vegetarians/vegans in the US has been stable at about 8% for more than a decade [2]. However, spending on plant-based meat has been growing (6% in 2016) [3]. It is telling that plant based burgers have been becoming more prominent in the last couple of years being offered at a rising number of burger chains. [4] However, most of the chains to offer plant based burgers have been more minor ones like White Castle, Cheesecake Factory and the like. [5] How interested in McDonald's specifically? McDonald's has long offered exceptionally little for vegetarians/vegans (a grade of F- by PETA) [6] Yet, the proliferation of meatless patties in Europe suggest this is an area they are interested in. The fact that Burger King (the main competitor to McDonalds) has partnered with Impossible Foods suggests it's in McDonald's to field that threat. On the other hand, McDonald's may want to consciously create an image of a brand that specifically serves carnivores (their extremely low PETA score is consistent with that). But again, given their European experimentation, that doesn't seem likely (although, on the other other hand, McDonald's is known to adapt to local markets, e.g. with Maharaja Mac in India).  Meatless patties are becoming more well-known with the arrival of Impossible and Beyond burgers. That means that the public is becoming more comfortable with the idea. Given the fact that neither Impossible nor Beyond have flopped yet (Beyond is in fact doing well in the stock market) suggests that meatless patties are gaining at least some traction. To watch/consider further:\n* is the timing sufficient? Netsle is launching its meatless burger in the US this year. McDonald's used Nestle in Europe (it launched its European burgers before Nestle did so a McDonald's launch doesn't have to happen after Nestle's launch [7]  [1] https://www.workandmoney.com/s/biggest-burger-chains-02bacbf3e4194e98\n[2] https://news.gallup.com/poll/238328/snapshot-few-americans-vegetarian-vegan.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=NEWSFEED&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Snapshot%3a%2520Few%2520Americans%2520Vegetarian%2520or%2520Vegan\n[3] https://www.gfi.org/new-data-sales-climbing-for-plant-based-foods\n[4] https://www.eater.com/2019/4/18/18412591/mcdonalds-fast-food-meatless-burger-analysis-impossible-foods-beyond-meat\n[5] https://www.aspca.org/news/these-fast-food-chains-are-serving-meatless-burgers-everyones-talking-about\n[6] https://www.peta.org/features/burger-chain-rankings/\n[7] https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/mcdonalds-meatless-burger-vegan/"], [75407, "2019-07-08T09:29:59Z", [0.7], "That is the trend!
