As soon as a fire has crossed 100,000 it appears it keeps burning for several reasons, such as a lack of water for containment or as a natural barrier, the geographical structure that promotes stronger winds, the type of local woods or vegetation that is affected and maybe even the impassable landscape.\nIt seems resources like firefighting planes are allocated to fresh fires in order to put out fires before they grow too large to be contained easily, imho, and of course to places where people's lives and livelihoods are in acute danger.\nThe fact that even large fire complexes such as  Scu Lightning Complex\n396,624 acres burned\nBurning for 39 days\nIncludes 3 fires\n98% contained Lnu Lightning Complex\n363,220 acres burned\nBurning for 40 days\n98% which are very close to civilization and larger cities, have mainained their containment status of  >95% for more than one week now but are still not extinct, underscores to me how hard it becomes with a certain size of fires and especially complexes.\nThus the fires I still expect to be active on 01 October 2020 are:\nAugust Complex (Includes 5 fires)\nScu Lightning Complex (Includes 3 fires)\nLnu Lightning Complex\nNorth Complex (Includes 23 fires)\nCreek\nSqf Complex (Includes 2 fires)\nCastle\nDolan\nBobcat\nRed Salmon Complex Claremont-bear would qualify, but the containment status is unknown.\nThe two first fires that might fall off the list are\nScu Lightning Complex (Includes 3 fires)\nLnu Lightning Complex\nsince their containment status is already near 100% and they are not expected to grow further.

Though there is no additional info about Slater, it seems it will be large enough to qualify even alone, and still active, but that is just guessing. The 10% uncertainty I assign to a very much higher number of fires, as the \"North Complex\" alone includes 23 individual named fires and I cannot conclude from the questions remarks, whether these will be counted individually or not, but it will likely not matter.

The situation on Sept 1 was exceptional so I'm not going to let that anchor my thinking. I'm trying to figure out a base rate.  I consulted with the great and powerful wikipedia and I was not disappointed. I learned that there aren't very many big fires, but they tend to last a long time. This tells me that this is more about how long the current fires last than how many more fires start. So noodling it, if we were NOT starting the month with a bunch of big fires I would call my base rate to be about 3 based on the 2014-2019 average of >10k fires.  However there is another way to view the base rate. Almost all of the active fires started around Aug 16-19. So they would need to still be active about 40-45 days after starting. It is currently 20 days or so. Historically about 40% of fires that lasted at least 20 days made it to 40 days. There are roughly 8-10 burning at the moment (technally there are a bunch of others that are not fully contained but I'm not counting those). I would estimate that roughly 4 of those would still be burning. On average 1.5 big fires start in Sept so i bump that up to 5.5 as my estimate.  I should note that 3 of the fires have the potential to merge, so I'll subtract 1. Call it 4.5.  I'm going with 4 or more as my main bucket.  https://www.predictiveservices.nifc.gov/outlooks/monthly_seasonal_outlook.pdf"], [92863, "2020-09-04T21:19:28Z", [0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.08, 0.87], "I have looked at the LA Fire Map which is extremely helpful from the question and thanks to Casey Miller for putting that together.

The questions then would be:\n/for how long will each individual of the current fires go on burning before it will be extinct and considered no longer active?\n/how many of the remaining fires <10,000 acres (currently 29, 16 of which have a \"containment\" status 10% to 98%, 13 have no such status and either lack detailed info or are already considered as contained) will reach the required criteria by 01 October 2020, and will remain active as well?\nHowever, there are other causes for wildfires to start, most importantly human intent, and technical (or human) failure. The 2018 Camp Fire (153,336 acres burned, \"was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history\") was almost surely ignited by faulty power lines belonging to the utility company Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Fire_%282018%29\nDrought as a precondition of wildfires will thus advance additional wildfires which will be ignited in other ways than lightning. Severe winds or fire storms will determine, how fast the affected area will grow. So far winds are likely to play a subordinated role. Due to uncertainties around the speed of the spread of individual fires and complexes, the CA fire fighters' capacity, and the scope at which CA fire fighters' response and success is impaired by the number of simultaneous fires on large areas to bring down each of the individual fires, the first forecast can only be a rough estimate, data is needed to be observed for at least a week for a more certain position.
