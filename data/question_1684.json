The most recent NBA player test resulted in 0 positive cases out of 346 players, and even the most recent one before that where results for 322 players tested on July 7 (results announced July 13) resulted in only 2 positive tests. Also, it seems like anyone that might be a likely suspect for breaking covid had already tested positive before even coming to the bubble (e.g. Jokic, who blatantly was seen hanging around Djokovic in Europe, Djokovic being a serious covid-denier). And, it seems like any breaches of quarantine / bubble are being taken seriously as well: for example, Richaun Holmes who briefly and barely left to simply pick up some food was forced to undergo another two week quarantine (Jul 13), and Lou Williams who left to attend his granfather's funeral and strip club was also mandated a 10-day quarantine after discovery. Now, there is still an extremely low chance that someone could leave completely undiscovered, but it seems like weekends would be the most likely time for that to happen and it being a Sunday night with no news released, being only 5 days out from the proposed July 30 start makes it nearly improbable that something will happen to force the NBA to delay the July 30 season re-start. "], [92809, "2020-07-26T21:45:24Z", [0.97], "Summary: We are quickly approaching the settlement date of this question, and the NBA appears determined to begin the season despite growing Covid case numbers in Florida, Texas, and California. While this appeared less likely earlier in the question's lifecycle, the NBA's stance has not changed - even positive test results from Kevin Durant and Deandre Jordan, as well as 12 other players, have not fazed them. The reference class for this type of question would be other sports leagues in the US - the NFL continues to push forward with their 2020 season (starting Sept. 10), and the MLB and NHL are following suit, with the NHL creating their own bubble in Edmonton. More importantly than setting the stage for other sports, the NBA is attempting to salvage part of the estimated $1 billion in losses on revenue from Covid. The stakes look extremely high for them, as they've rented out a Walt Disney amusement park and heavily marketed the beginning of the upcoming season (estimated investment of $170 million) - their Twitter account continues to promote the beginning of the season 4 days from now. In summary, the NBA's willingness to continue with the season despite over a dozen players testing positive and a second wave appearing cross the US, shows a determination to run this season as planned. I arrived at my probability estimate by assuming the default case is that the NBA season resumes on July 30, unless a drastic event happens. This drastic event could be any number of terrible things, but the most likely is a Covid outbreak within the bubble the NBA has set up. The  chance of an infected person getting into the bubble is roughly equal to Probability(a person is infected) * Probability(covid test does not detect). Since there will be maximum 500 people, (about a dozen teams, max 17 players per team + coaches, assistants, etc), assuming a maximum infection rate of 10%, and a covid test failure rate of  30% (both most likely overestimations, and there are multiple tests conducted on the players), a bad-event probability of 3% seems roughly fair. What could go wrong: An infected person gets into the bubble and causes an outbreak, forcing the NBA to shutdown due to player incapacitation or PR problems.

The most likely way for this question to resolve negatively is that the season is delayed, as there are only 2 games on the 30th (with 33 preseason games from the 22nd-30th). While this is unlikely with the recent update, the season could be delayed if at least one of the teams in each of the 2 games is incapacitated by COVID-19, injuries, some other reason. https://sports.yahoo.com/no-nba-players-test-positive-211836769.html\nhttps://stats.nba.com/schedule/"], [92815, "2020-07-21T03:20:08Z", [0.97], "This week, the MLB is planning on restarting games. In only 10 days, the NBA plans on following suit. The two leagues have different approaches to how games will be played. For baseball, games are being played in different home stadiums across the country, with a schedule that only features regional play. For basketball, all games are being played at one facility. 22 of the 30 teams are planning on restarting the season in ten days. At this point, it seems all but certain that play will begin on time. However, Florida is experiencing a major resurgence of coronavirus. On top of this, in a high contact, indoor sport like basketball, disease transmission will be high if the virus makes its way into the bubble that the NBA has created. However, given that the start of the season is close, it seems that if a coronavirus event were to occur that delay the NBA games, it would likely be during the course of the season. Games have the ability to be super-spreading events due to the nature of basketball. Seeing that infection rates are currently particularly high, it seems quite likely that the coronavirus will be detected in a player this summer and fall. I believe a delay of the first game of the season is unlikely as it casts doubt over the remainder of the season and the current plan to play in Florida. To delay this season that has been planned for over a month would restart discussions about the safety of this plan, and could end up cancelling the entire endeavor. I think this is a situation that the commissioner, the players and the owners would all like to avoid. Furthermore, it would be incredibly unprofitable to further delay the season. This is such a unique situation that a base rate would not have enough samples to be meaningful. It seems likely that baseball will return without delay.  European soccer leagues are returning to play largely without delay, but the coronavirus situation there is much better, with lower numbers of infection. I believe there is a 1/33 chance of something going fatally wrong before the first game begins. This is hard to estimate because of lack of mathematical grounding and the uniqueness of the situation, but I believe that something very significant (a two sigma event) would need to take place to stop the season at this point. https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/11974437/project-restart-what-is-the-state-of-play-in-europes-top-leagues\nhttps://www.nba.com/article/2020/06/26/nba-schedule-release-2019-20-season-comeback-official\n"], [529, "2020-07-21T03:16:27Z", [0.96], ""], [92803, "2020-07-21T01:22:43Z", [0.97], ""], [35642, "2020-07-21T00:35:08Z", [1.0], ""], [22689, "2020-07-21T00:02:13Z", [0.99], ""], [92794, "2020-07-21T00:00:14Z", [0.97], ""], [92939, "2020-07-20T23:13:22Z", [0.99], ""], [89135, "2020-07-20T22:02:37Z", [1.0], "https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-nbpa-announce-zero-positive-213654486.html"], [94348, "2020-07-20T21:59:00Z", [0.2], ""], [92786, "2020-07-20T20:28:41Z", [0.97], "No more news of cases on the bubble, and time decay of risk."], [93518, "2020-07-20T20:15:59Z", [0.97], ""], [92819, "2020-07-20T19:42:10Z", [0.99], ""], [92817, "2020-07-20T17:09:46Z", [0.97], "My first forecast was 19 days before the planned start, and it is now 10 days before the start of the season.

Of the 20 projected starting players of these games, all have continued to test negative and remain quarantining. The recent news of 2 players testing positive and breaking quarantine may demonstrate that there is reason to suspect other NBA players may also break quarantine. However, due to heightened security and the realized knowledge that the NBA is actually taking action to isolate and prevent these players from playing means that players are probably going to be less likely to break official rules.

In particular, 2 factors seem to be the most important: 1) government green light on resuming 2) teams quarantining together 2-3 weeks before the competition. As long as these two conditions are met and the leagues having announced official start date, the start rate is 100% (I might have missed some smaller leagues so could be an adverse selection bias here, will keep checking on this). For NBA, these two factors likely won't be an issue: 1) Florida has been one of the more aggressive states in opening back up, and DeSantis is very firm on this. Also given that the government okayed arrangements like the Citadel bubble, it probably would not get in the way of NBA. 2) all 22 teams are in a bubble as of today (7/11). So my prior is 98%, revised down due to possible adverse selection. Reasons for increasing:\n1. After seeing many successful examples, it would be easier for NBA just to model its restarting protocol after European/Asian leagues. Because of this, I will adjust up my estimate by 2%. Reasons for decreasing:\n1. Florida COVID numbers are climbing fast and going north of 11,000 cases per day. If this trend continues, the public sentiment toward reopening would definitely decrease and may force the government to take measures to postpone NBA. I will set it as a 7% probability, in line with the number of states reversing reopening in measures more severe than Florida right now (4/55). Thus, I will use a *93% overlay to the number after incorporating other factors.\n2. Bubble burst: although the bubbles are stringent and relatively safe, it only takes 1 player to break the bubble and ruin the whole thing. It's only been a few days since the bubble started, but there's already been multiple complaints about the living conditions and wanting to flip... And NBA players don't exactly have the reputation to following rules... Two potential effects of this: 1) players bring back virus, and enough people get infected so have to postpone 2) reputation hit, seeing news of this people will be mad and NBA may be pressure to take measures. It's hard to model/quantify, so I'll revise down my estimate by 3% (I will keep thinking about this)\n3. Weather concerns: Historically, Disney has been forced to close down operations during hurricanes (3 times in the past 4 years). Given that NOAA has predicted 60% chance of above-normal hurricanes this year, I would say there could be 1 hurricane forcing Disney to close all operations. Florida's hurricane season is July to October, so the chance of it hitting the days around July 30th, meaning within 2 days prior/after is minimal (5/123). If this is the case, NBA may just move the start date a few days later. So I would give it a 118/123 = 96% overlay.

The players are already in a \"Disney Bubble\" in Orlando, and some players with concerns will not be playing in Orlando, yet there is still a plan to resume the season. Certain NBA insiders, such as the Bucks' owner, are also highly confident that the season will continue. Argument against resuming: COVID cases in FL are among the largest rates in the country right now, and political pressure could convince the NBA to cave. As we've seen in this climate, things can change quickly within a matter of days.

Specifically, the players for all these 22 teams will begin travelling to Orlando on July 7th, and NBA works with Disney to use Walt Disney\u2019s World Resort near Orland to hold all remaining games, team practices, and player housing. In addition, there will be no audiences in any of these games and essentially NBA players and game workers are live inside a self-contained professional bubble.  The base rate is pretty high as examples of such isolated professional bubble are proved to be effective and successful:  1.\tCitadel Palm Beach: No confirm COVID-19 cases since starts on March 2020. In addition, as long as safety measure are rigorously followed, Citadel are able to bring in new group of limited numbers of employees, such as summer interns, etc. And, the setup of these professional restrict-access work site can be copied to other locations. NBA have in total around 450 players and assume each player on average has three supporting staffs, then in total there are around 1800 staffs. Clearly the setup to hold the entire NBA workplace requires a lot more caution and preparation comparing to Citadel\u2019s remote onsite workplace, I would give a base success rate of 85%.  2.\tMajor League Soccer (MLS): Recently the MLS restart on July 8th at the exact same site \u2013 Walt Disney\u2019s World Resort, as NBA will be. In addition, MLS\u2019s restart offers a continuous schedule of matches nearly every day beginning July 8th. The success of MLS is more interesting and a more powerful reference base rate point for NBA compared to Citadel\u2019s Palm Beach. MLS has in total about 710 players, and assume the same number of supporting staffs needed for each player, MLS need to setup a site that can hold around 2800 people. Based on their success, I would give a base rate of 99%.  Note that we are only discussing the success rate for resuming games on July 30th 2020, rather than NBA complete the remaining games without COVID-19 cases. This would alleviate us with a lot other consideration such as what\u2019s the risk factors that would bring COVID-19 cases inside the professional bubble. In addition, both 2 base rate cases has successfully starts on their remote onsite workplaces, I would weight the MLS\u2019s one more as the number of employees are at the similar scale with NBA.

Given the massive logistical effort, I assume that the probability of a postponement for reasons other than coronavirus are minimal. Currently two NBA games are scheduled for July 30th: Jazz vs Pelicans @ 6:30pm EST and Clippers vs Lakers @ 9:00pm EST. It is unclear what would happen if one of these teams were removed from competition due to positive coronavirus tests. I assume that the NBA would simply remove those games as opposed to bringing forward other games or changing the match-ups. This reasoning is based on the procedure followed by MLS. Under these assumptions, the probability of a delayed restart is similar to the probability that the (Jazz or Pelicans) and (Clippers or Lakers) receive sufficient positive tests to be excluded from play. We continue with MLS as our base case as it is the only team sport to have resumed in the US. (UFC has resumed but, as an individual sport, it is easier to continue matches if an individual participant tests positive.) We saw MLS restart on July 8th at the same Disney bubble and already Dallas FC and Nashville FC have been removed due to positive coronavirus tests (out of 22 teams). Our base rate is then (0.09*2)^2=0.03 (as we need at least one team from both games to be removed). However, we can revise this base rate. The arguements for increasing it are that\n(a) the NBA shares facilities at Disney with MLS which is seeing COVID-19 cases,\n(b) if enough other teams test positive there is a chance the whole event is delayed, and\n(c) there will be exhibition games played on the 22nd which may increase transmission likelihood if a player is infected.\nThe main argument for decreasing the base rate is the fact that teams arrived at least three weeks prior to the season start so individuals who test positive for COVID-19 have time to recover and quarantine in time for opening games. All teams arrived in Orlando on or prior to July 9th.

But we have LeBron James working hard and ready to restart. If any single player could inspire confidence in a restart right now, it's him.  My estimate isn't only based on those two articles, but they are the highlights right now. Several players are opting out of the restart due to virus concerns for themselves and family members. Several players have tested positive, and probably more will once in FL. There are definitely some players and coaches who want to play - many who might not ordinarily get a lot of play time during a \"regular\" season could have more incentive, more of chance to shine.  As of 7/9, teams are already showing up to the bubble with more to come...so maybe the NBA will have it's restart but not finish it."], [87943, "2020-07-09T13:32:34Z", [0.9], ""], [57778, "2020-07-09T06:07:33Z", [0.75], ""], [86554, "2020-07-09T05:16:50Z", [0.93], ""], [92819, "2020-07-09T01:46:08Z", [0.95], "My prior is 98%. As of now, self-contained groups of professionals living and working in one location (ex: Citadel in Palm Beach)  have been able to keep their perimeter tight and not allow the virus in. Citadel, as far as I know, has had 0 cases in Palm Beach since setting up shop in March 2020. Even essential employees who have to commute to work have seen minimal infections (ex: ConEd had 170 infections out of appx 8,000 essential employees, translating to a 2.1% infection rate). Therefore, my prior states that professional organizations and the medical community have now had enough experience with the virus to know best practices to keep appx 98% of a professional population safe.  My likelihood calculations further increase my probability of opening. For the NBA to postpone opening, one of two things must happen.  1) the players want to play but COVID infects enough individuals such that teams are no longer have enough individuals to compete. Given that there are 14 players on a team and 5 on court at any given time, appx 9 individuals must be infected and out of commission for this scenario to happen. Note that this approach to analysis assumes individuals can be flexible and play positions they don't usually play. Therefore, the probability for 9 individuals on the same team being infected are .02^9 assuming independent odds of getting infected. While I know this is not the case, I am not exactly sure how to model it otherwise besides potentially just adding in a buffer to my calculations. Therefore, I will say there is a 0.10^9 chance (5x probability increase) of a team being infected, which = 1* 10^-9 which is negligible. I also assume that if one team cannot play, then the entire season is postponed, likely a conservative assumption given my pre-requisite condition (all players want to play).  2. The players don't want to play. As of July 8th at 8am, there were 12 players who voluntarily refused to go (CBS Sports). Given that there are roughly 450 players in the NBA total, that is 2.6% of players refusing. Therefore, the math here is similar to point 1 above showing dismally small odds for enough players to sit out such that a team cannot operate. Additionally, the individuals sitting out have all generally come from different teams: Nets (4), Wizards (2) , Pacers (1), Lakers (1), Portland Trail Blazers (1), Mavericks (1). Note that the Nets have 17 players, more than the 14 average number I used in my calculations in 1. Therefore, there is still no real risk for the Nets to drop out of Orlando, and even if they did, I doubt the entire season would be cancelled/postponed for them. Therefore, I consider this risk to be, again 0.1 per player drop percentage (buffer built in) raised to the 9 for the average team in order to not have enough players. Therefore 0.1^9 arrived at the same dismal probability as in 1, which gives me confidence to predict a high probability.  I would put 99% but I do recognize that there is the potential for tail risk events such as a sudden outbreak, contaminated food making players sick (not COVID), etc. Because of all of this, I feel comfortable giving another buffer here of 4% to arrive at a final estimate of 95%."], [79461, "2020-07-09T00:46:40Z", [0.75], ""], [91142, "2020-07-09T00:10:31Z", [0.92], ""], [529, "2020-07-08T22:49:13Z", [0.69], "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/us/mls-is-back-match-postponed-spt-trnd/index.html"], [88198, "2020-07-08T22:38:21Z", [0.65], "A very long 22 days to go...will crank this higher as time passes if no major hiccups, but I think the current surge in Orange Co.

More players ( - current number up to 25, 7% of all players -) are (currently) testing positive (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/02/886874079/nba-says-9-more-players-test-positive-for-coronavirus) , and Orange County cases appear to be increasing (https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/06/26/florida-reports-nearly-9000-new-cases-of-covid-19-shattering-single-day-record/).  Some Disney Orlando employees are reportedly not quarantined or tested daily, though few are supposed to have regular contact with the NBA personnel. (https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-orlando-restart-chances-2020-053825945.html)  The NBA has spent money and 'hyped' the restart so I'll guess that they'll try to push (at least) starting the season, unless personnel test-positives continue to increase (esp. in the next few weeks).
