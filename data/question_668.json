The reason no north Korean missiles have been shot at or down to date is because they havent been deemed to be targeted at a target such as a city and there is the opportunity to learn almost as much from their launch as they do themselves. \nThe US can test their missile defense systems without showing their hands and firing at North Korean missiles. So to answer you have to answer is North Korea going to start a shooting war between now and May by firing at a target, even the most pessimistic would have to consider that unlikely at the moment.  In recent Months we have seen Kim move from outward belligerence to Diplomacy, they have won a small PR battle at the Winter Olympics, They have opened communications with the South and they are planning a meeting with President TRUMP.    \nKim visited Xie last month in Beijing, it is no secret that the Chinese would favor that Kim not rock the boat and antagonize the  US with missile launches. They are also said to have experienced some success with their missiles, so why keep testing. \nA test now would only anger the US and potentially create tensions at home. Hitler was all powerful but when a few generals etc thought they were being led down the garden path tried to kill him, there is no reason this couldn't happen in North Korea, although I admit the dynamics are different, any sort of major civil unrest would be incredibly turbulent, something I'm sure Xie would have emphasized last month. \nSo I'm basing my prediction regarding shooting at a missile strongly to the North Koreans launching one, possibly a text book 'bait and switch'\n"], [56381, "2018-04-09T01:07:17Z", [0.01, 0.01, 0.98], "Adjusting since the deadline is less than a month away.

Posturing and threats that give the North Korean regime room to operate and negotiate are a much more valuable use of their nuclear weapons then starting a war. The US and other countries know this too, so they are unlikely to shoot at demonstration ICBM's from North Korea.   As for the 50% chance of the missile flight being interrupted by a missile defense system, these systems have not been extensively tested, due to the cost and technical challenge of doing so, and the North Korean ICBM program has advanced more quickly than anticipated, so there is the potential that they are more sophisticated than analysts expect.

Several failed tests, missiles breaking up upon reentering the earth's atmosphere, and a missile accidentally hitting a N. Korean city all suggest that N. Korea's tech is not that advanced. My YES probability exists largely due to recent inflammatory comments from the US president (including referring to Kim Jong Un as 'little rocket man') that appear to have escalated the animosity between North Korea and the USA. This is reflected in comments from political leaders across the world:  \"We must stop a situation where North Korea miscalculates and threatens us with nuclear weapons or where the United States considers a pre-emptive strike.\" - Mr Moon (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/28/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-reports-may-have-landed/)  If world leaders are nervous that the USA might strike BEFORE being attacked by N. Korea, the chance that they will shoot a missile defence system is comparatively probable, as this would be a far less extreme action than a preemptive strike.

If Mr. Kim test fires an ICBM (Hwasong-14) the only device in the American arsenal that would have a chance to interrupt its flight path (and destroy it) woud be an Alaska based Ground Based Interceptor.  The targeted H-14 would be intercepted sometime following its boost phase and would likely be impacted over the Russian East, which would raise some serious questions from Moscow as to whether it was tracking a GBI or a hostile American ICBM (they will look the same on radar).  If the H-14 is fired towards Guam, impact would likely occur over the Pacific Ocean and be less likely to panic the Russians.  The GBI technology that is deployed would require 4 GBI interceptors to be launched to achieve a 97% kill possibility which is about 1/11th our our total missile force.  Missing the target would carry with it serious implications for perceptions of American deterrent capabilities, so it is likely that multiple missiles would be fired (perhaps as many as 6).  In short, this is a risky and expensive undertaking. Should NK fire an MRBM, it is possible that the THAAD or Aegis systems would be used.  THAAD systems have sucessfully intercepted MRBM at least three times with one test approximating battlefield conditions.   It is possible to launch multiple interceptors from SK, from US Navy platforms, and from Guan itself.  While hitting a NK MRBM is still difficult (and failure would undermine US ABM credibility), if fired over the Pacific there would be less downside to interception and a greater likelihood of use.   The questions must be answered with both scenerios in mind.  As the SK intelligence service has predicted a new wave of launches will occur before the year is out, there will be multiple opportunities to test these systems.  Should NK launch an ICBM, there is very little likelihood of an ABM response.  If a MRBM is launched towards Guam or over the Sea of Japan, it is much more likely that there would be an ABM reply.  Given the kinetic nature of these systems, I suggest that the missle path must be interrupted if fire upon because, as stated earlier, we can't afford to miss and will fire multiple interceptors.

Currently the US Navy and the Japanese Navy deploy these missiles.  Range is between 700km and 2500km respectively.  Intercept rates appear to be high, but there have been misses some caused by human error.  However, success rates appear to be pretty high in tests, upwards of 90%. When asked why the USA has not shot at a NK missile, SEC Mattis said that none of the missiles were a direct threat.  As a policy this would explain why the USA and JAP have not targeted any of the missiles yet. So, let's rephrase the question--\"Will NK fire a missile on a such a threatening trajectory that Japan or the USA will fire at it before May 1, 2018?\" This requires for the USA that at least 1 x Aegis cruiser remains within range of launch sites in NK as there are limited other BMD systems available. There are advantages to letting the missiles go, intelligence collection is an important consideration.  The other is not risking a miss that the world would watch. There are reasons to shoot however, like demonstrating capability.  But the POTUS has not made a specific redline he'd be forced to heel to yet. I do not think that NK would do this because it does not improve their capabilities.  But there is a chance and I think that chance is 4% because NK's leader may think it is a rational thing to do.

THAADs capability will allow it to intercept a missile in flight along its trajectory.  This question has more of a political flavor rather a military one.   Interception of NK missiles not directed at SK, Japanese or US targets will most likely will not encounter THAAD responses.  A political decision to intercept would have to account for all strategic interactions among actors along with a unitary response from target nations.   Attacks on targeted nation states would most likely have a high probability of a set of THAAD interactions with a reciprocal response from states in the alliance.  The question therefore becomes whether a strategic interaction would result in a path closer to an initiation of war (by all actors) or not.   A response, if chosen, would have to account for a ballistic missile armed or not armed with nuclear capability.  If a nuclear ballistic missile were encountered in the set of military interactions, a selected strategic response would initially include a THAAD interaction along with an ICBM response, initiating a response to war.  Given the high costs of war on human capital, military architecture and the outcomes of an ongoing conflagration  will result in significant costs for NK, its population, SK and it allies notwithstanding global outrage at the violent outcomes of war; these interactions could serve as a significant deterrent for all actors.
